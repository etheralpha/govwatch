Product Information</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product:</strong> USYC earns short-term risk-free rate returns. Our clients, upon successfully completing KYC/AML, can instantly mint and redeem USYC into their whitelisted wallets 24/7 from USDC and PYUSD. USYC can also be minted and redeemed into USDT and fiat. The token is available as Ethereum ERC20, NEAR, BASE and will soon be integrated with Axelar.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset:</strong> USYC is the on-chain representation of Hashnote’s regulated International Short Duration Yield Fund (iSDYF). iSDYF uses its prime broker Marex and custodian BNY Mellon to invest cash into overnight reverse-repo to ensure minimised market risk, duration risk, and credit risk. Whether the investor chooses to purchase with fiat or stablecoin, the amount of USYC the investor receives is equal to the deposit amount divided by the current price of USYC. Hashnote mints into the investor’s wallet an amount of USYC tokens equivalent to the number of shares the investor has in the iSDYF.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong> We update the price of the token daily to reflect the yield that has been earned overnight.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong> Hashnote International Short Duration Yield Fund Ltd (iSDYF), a mutual fund providing the USYC product, is domiciled in the Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p>It is managed by its investment manager, Hasnote Management LLC, a United States limited liability company formed in Delaware.</p>\n<p>We adhere to strict regulations, ensuring our operations meet institutional investment standards.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong> Our PPM permits investment into T Bills but currently we only invest into reverse repo.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong> No we don’t do any hedging; however, reverse repo can be described as a derivative product.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong> Users can expect instant atomic on-chain 24/7 minting and redemptions into USDC and PUYSD 24/7 via Hashnote’s “Teller” smart contract.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, onboarded users can use a “manual” method with fiat, USDC, USDT or PUYSD, T+0 or T+1. Redemptions made before 2:00 pm ET are processed by 5:00 pm ET the same day.

Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong> To help investors enter and exit their positions efficiently, we provide a Smart Contract Teller to facilitate investing in the fund and liquidating the asset on-chain. <a href=\"https://usyc.docs.hashnote.com/overview/smart-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Smart Contract Teller</a> allows the client to have up to 100% instant liquidity into PYUSD at all times.

Hashnote will accept PUYSD, USDT, USDC or fiat as subscription and redemption assets. Upon acceptance as MakerDAO collateral, Hashnote will make DAI a redemption asset.</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong> We aim to enable instant, 24/7 minting and redemption of USYC into more stablecoins. USYC stands out from the rest of the tokenized RWAs as it finds its application across the digital asset ecosystem as a whole. As a treasury management tool and an alternative to holding stablecoins we are already backing the<a href=\"https://usual.money/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Usual</a> stablecoin. As a collateral token used by custodians, centralised and decentralised exchanges, USYC boosts liquidity and collateral efficiency for trading, borrowing, and lending. To expand its reach, we are forming new partnerships, bridging to more chains, and adding market makers. By 2025, we plan to be available on multiple venues and currently adding more market makers.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98951-iv-legal-structure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98951-iv-legal-structure-4\"></a>IV.

The oracle is maintained by<a href=\"https://go.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-oracle-docs.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Chainalysis</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minting &amp; Burning Hashnote mints new USYC tokens when investors subscribe manually (via Fiat or stables).

What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong> Hashnote has engaged several independent auditors to review our smart contracts. The audits have been completed by Sentnl and ChainSafe as well as an independent security researcher Anton Cheng.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98951-vi-makerdao-ecosystem-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98951-vi-makerdao-ecosystem-6\"></a>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong> We submitted an <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/usyc-mip6-collateral-application-hashnote-s-us-yield-coin/25050\">application to MakerDao</a> offering USYC instead of <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/wbtc-changes-and-risk-mitigation-10-august-2024/24844\">WBTC</a> addressing the community’s risk concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong> Hashnote is approaching Maker with longevity and stability and mind, and we believe that introducing Hashnote USYC is fully aligned with “<a href=\"https://endgame.makerdao.com/endgame/overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Endgame Plan</a>” proposed by Rune Christensen.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrating Hashnote USYC supports this strategy by increasing the share of Real-World Assets (RWA) as collateral, thereby reducing dependence on USDC and significantly improving the profit and loss margin of MakerDAO. <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/centrifuge-maker-a-partner-s-view-of-real-world-assets/17439\">Dai can best scale its usage and maintain its peg by issuing against non-correlated, yield bearing, and reliable assets. </a></li>\n<li>A strategic partnership with Hashnote expands Maker growth opportunities by tapping into a larger and more stable addressable market: professional and institutional crypto investors and tradfi community alike. Unlike other yield-bearing tokens, Hashnote USYC use-case goes beyond treasury management savings vehicle. USYC is designed and is growing to be the universally accepted collateral token accepted by centralised and decentralised exchanges as well as lending and custody providers and further down the line should be introduced to venues like CME to further enhance collateral efficiency in the tradfi space.</li>\n<li>Through this strategic partnership, Hashnote community and its stakeholders are likely to be attracted to Spark, which would <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600\">positively impact the growth of SparkLend</a>. Hashnote is actively working on launching multiple lending products in collaboration with centralised venues, attracting professional investors and large institutional clients. We anticipate that this will bring a similar user base to the MakerDAO ecosystem, positioning it as a gateway into DeFi for users who haven’t explored DeFi yet.</li>\n<li>Hashnote fully addresses and safeguards the concerns of the Maker community while ensuring legal recognition of their assets. The Hashnote team comes with extensive experience in traditional finance and aims to leverage the transparency and credibility offered by blockchain technology to bridge the gap between on-chain and off-chain asset representations.</li>\n<li>With Hashnote’s expertise in tokenization, Maker Governance can gain a powerful gateway to engage in “real-world” activities. We fully agree that DeFi requires a foundational layer of collateral anchored to more stable, secular supply and demand dynamics, and RWAs are a crucial step toward achieving this vision.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong> Morpho is a lending protocol that enhances capital efficiency by optimising yields on lending pools. Hashnote USYC serves as <a href=\"https://app.morpho.org/vault?vault=0xbEEF02e5E13584ab96848af90261f0C8Ee04722a&amp;network=mainnet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">collateral</a> on the Morpho platform for the <a href=\"https://www.steakhouse.financial/projects/usyc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Steakhouse PYUSD vault</a>, making it the key venue for borrowing and lending PYUSD on Ethereum mainnet and offering one of the most efficient environments for PYUSD lending.</p>\n<p>This partnership allows users to earn higher yields compared to traditional DeFi lending protocols by leveraging the stability and potential returns of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs). Additionally, the collaboration attracts institutional clients to DeFi by combining Morpho’s efficient lending mechanisms with Hashnote’s regulated, tokenized products, providing a strong value proposition for large-scale investors.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong> Yes, Hashnote is a diversified asset manager that continuously launches new products. We are always exploring opportunities to offer innovative solutions that could be suitable for Spark or other SubDAOs. As we develop new offerings, we will actively engage with the DAO to understand their specific needs and collaborate on potential opportunities.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your attention.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-hashnote-usyc/25101\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-hashnote-usyc/25101","pubDate":"Sat, 14 Sep 2024 10:07:33 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25101"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-hashnote-usyc/25101.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Hashnote $USYC"},"filter":false},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Spiko (USTBL)","dc:creator":"pahyppolite","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-98943-i-product-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98943-i-product-summary-1\"></a><strong>I.

Company Details</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Company description</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Spiko</strong> is a Paris-based startup building and operating a platform for issuing, managing, and distributing tokenized funds. Spiko aims to become the foremost financial market infrastructure, enabling the native issuance and management of all types of financial instruments on blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>Throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024, Spiko spearheaded and oversaw the project that led to the launch of the first Ethereum-native USD- and EUR-denominated Money Market Funds (MMFs) approved in the European Union. Shares of the Spiko MMFs, launched to the public in mid-June 2024, are exclusively issued as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks.</p>\n<p>Three months after their launch, the Spiko MMFs have amassed $92M in assets under management, handled $135M in investment and redemption flows, and generated over $300K in interest. Consequently, Spiko has quickly become one of the leading tokenizers of T-Bills, with its tokenized MMFs experiencing the fastest growth in the sector in recent weeks (<a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocols/RWA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">source</a>).</p>\n<p>Spiko developed and maintains the transfer agent software used to manage the Spiko MMFs on-chain. The Funds are distributed by <strong>Spiko Finance</strong>, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spiko that is regulated as an investment adviser in France.</p>\n<p>Both Spiko and Spiko Finance are French simplified join-stock companies (<em>société par actions simplifiée</em> or “SAS” under French law). The Spiko SICAV, which is the legal entity that issues and manages the Spiko MMFs, is completely separate from Spiko and Spiko Finance. The Spiko SICAV is owned by token holders, with each token representing a share in the Spiko MMFs.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/f/4f4afb12c4bc68b4ad974ebe67d7a3df10cc08bc.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bjsmFIKGFjiRba4rnZzzSBECnfe.png?dl=1\" title=\"1.

Product Information</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Describe the product</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund is a sub-fund of the Spiko SICAV.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SICAV\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SICAV</a> (which stands for “Société d’Investissement à Capital Variable”) is a European investment fund structure akin to a U.S. open-end mutual fund, allowing investors to subscribe to and redeem shares while the fund’s assets are professionally managed.</p>\n<p>Incorporated in France under French law, the Spiko SICAV currently manages two sub-funds approved by the French Financial Markets Authority (<a href=\"https://www.amf-france.org/en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Autorité des Marchés Financiers</a>) as short-term variable net asset value MMFs under the UCITS Directive (Directive 2009/65/EC) and the MMF Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1131).</p>\n<p>UCITS (which stands for “Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities”) funds are the European Union’s equivalent to U.S. mutual funds. Before a UCITS can be marketed to investors, its prospectus must be approved by a national competent authority of the European Union. This process is similar to that of a mutual fund’s approval by the SEC in the United States.</p>\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund is the world’s first public money market fund whose shares (USTBL) are natively issued as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. <em>N.B.: in this context, ‘public,’ as opposed to ‘private,’ means that the Fund is approved for distribution to the general public, including retail (i.e. non-professional, non-accredited or non-qualified) investors.</em></p>\n<p>The Fund’s prospectus references the smart contract that officially serves as the shareholder register: 0xe4880249745eAc5F1eD9d8F7DF844792D560e750. As a result, the blockchain acts  as the definitive source of truth for the shareholder register, rather than simply being an on-chain copy of a separate centralized database. The Fund’s shares (USTBL) can be custodied at investors’ discretion using any wallet technology compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the key characteristics of the Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th><strong>Spiko US T-Bills MMF (USTBL)</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ISIN</strong></td>\n<td>FR001400ODM9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bloomberg ticker</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPKUSMM:FP\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SPKUSMM</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Currency</strong></td>\n<td>$ USD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Type of fund</strong></td>\n<td>UCITS short-term VNAV Money Market Fund under EU law</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fund domicile</strong></td>\n<td>France</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>National competent authority</strong></td>\n<td>French Financial Markets Authority (<a href=\"https://www.amf-france.org/en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AMF</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Legal structure</strong></td>\n<td>SICAV</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Investment policy</strong></td>\n<td>T-Bills issued by the U.S. Treasury</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Benchmark</strong></td>\n<td>Effective Federal Funds Rate (<a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EFFR</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Maximum weighted average maturity</strong></td>\n<td>60 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Use of income</strong></td>\n<td>Accumulating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fees</strong></td>\n<td>Management fees: 0.30% (per annum, deducted daily on a prorata basis).

Owning a portfolio of T-Bills held in custody, rather than being exposed to the counterparty risk of an issuer (whether it’s a stablecoin issuer or an SPV), would be valuable for the Sky ecosystem. Importantly, USTBL is also completely insulated from crypto market dynamics because the Fund does not hold crypto-assets on its balance sheet. For instance, USTBL is entirely shielded from the risk of a stablecoin depegging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Secondly, <strong>USTBL would provide the Sky ecosystem with exceptional legal protection and regulatory clarity on its reserves</strong>. USTBL is a regulated product, approved in the largest asset management jurisdiction in continental Europe, and governed by some of the most protective investor rules globally (e.g. the UCITS Directive and the MMF Regulation). USTBL is authorized for public distribution, ensuring the highest level of disclosure through a prospectus that cannot be modified without the regulator’s approval. Importantly, USTBL is also issued in a jurisdiction that recognizes  blockchains (incl. public ones such as Ethereum) as the primary source of truth for the shareholder register.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thirdly, <strong>USTBL would provide the Sky ecosystem with oversight and voting rights in the governance of the tokenized T-Bills held in its reserves</strong>. Sky would indeed have voting rights at the Spiko SICAV’s general shareholders’ meeting in proportion to its USTBL holdings. Besides, a representative from the Sky ecosystem could join the board of the SICAV issuing USTBL if elected by the general assembly of shareholders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, <strong>UTSBL would grant Sky direct access to the issuer of a key asset in its reserves for subscriptions and redemptions in both fiat (USD) and stablecoins (USDC, USDT, USDS)</strong>. USTBL are minted or burned once per business day around 10:30 AM CET at the previous day’s NAV.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><em><strong>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Currently, USTBL (as well as EUTBL, our EUR-denominated tokenized MMF) is held in the treasury of many Web3 organizations but are not yet integrated into DeFi protocols. We have a roadmap to develop these integrations in the coming months.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><em><strong>Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Spiko’s setup is advantageous because it is regulator-approved and extremely flexible for launching new products. We could envision launching any type of fund as a new sub-fund of the Spiko SICAV to meet the needs of the Sky ecosystem, including Spark or any other SubDAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98943-documentation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98943-documentation-7\"></a><strong>Documentation</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.spiko.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spiko Docs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.spiko.xyz/defi/on-chain-addresses\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spiko On-chain Addresses</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spiko-tech/contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spiko Smart Contracts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.spiko.xyz/prospectus\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spiko SICAV Prospectus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0xe4880249745eAc5F1eD9d8F7DF844792D560e750\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UTSBL shareholder register on Etherscan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://polygonscan.com/token/0xe4880249745eAc5F1eD9d8F7DF844792D560e750\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USTBL shareholder register on Polygonscan</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-spiko-ustbl/25097\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-spiko-ustbl/25097","pubDate":"Fri, 13 Sep 2024 21:24:35 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25097"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-spiko-ustbl/25097.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Spiko (USTBL)"},"filter":false},{"title":"2nd Notice - Attention WBTC Vault and WBTC SparkLend Users","dc:creator":"ecosystem-team","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>This is the second official notice from the Sky Ecosystem regarding the offboarding of WBTC-A, WBTC-B, WBTC-C, and WBTC on SparkLend.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/wbtc-changes-and-risk-mitigation-10-august-2024/24844/26\">proposal</a> to offboard WBTC collateral exposure from the Sky Ecosystem, including Legacy Vault Types and SparkLend, has been initiated by <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the proposal, the offboarding will be conducted in several steps over multiple Executive Votes.

Describe the underlying asset</h3>\n<p>The Fund will seek to provide a liquid, low risk portfolio through exposure to U.S Treasury Bills (T-bills) with maturities of between 0-3 months. The portfolio is carefully structured to manage yield curve, duration, and liquidity risks.</p>\n<p>T-Bills are highly rated short-term debt securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, with maturities of up to one year. They are widely recognized as one of the safest investment vehicles due to their high credit quality supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Furthermore, interest rate risk and volatility are low due to the short-term maturity of the instrument.</p>\n<p>The fund started with a portfolio T-bills with maturities of between 0-6 months.

This enables stakeholders to continuously track, in a trustless manner, the full movements of cash from the onchain USDS and USDC holdings to offchain cash balances, to the detailed list of holdings at the LTF’s custodian.</p>\n<p>The next step in further integrating Chronicle oracles is to have the oracle directly check custodian balances itself, verifying CUSIP level market prices and other metadata.

Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</h3>\n<p>The Fund is established as a BVI professional fund. This legal structure provides the best possible investor protection of any tokenized treasury product currently available. It is the same legal structure used by Blackrock, although that offering has been adapted to be open to US investors while Anemoy is exclusively offshore to avoid potential regulatory risk from the SEC or other US regulators.</p>\n<p>The BVI professional fund structure provides direct recourse for investors to the segregated and ring-fenced assets of the Liquid Treasury Fund (i.e., US T-Bills and USD cash) in case of liquidation of the Fund.</p>\n<p>Importantly, this direct recourse is <em><strong>enshrined in law</strong></em> rather than a mere contractual right.</p>\n<p>This structure is more advantageous for investors than other tokenized treasury products such as SPV/debt offerings or exempt US 3(c)(7) funds.</p>\n<p>In the case of products structured as debt offerings issued by an SPV, the investors have no exclusive claim to the assets and will need to prove their claim as against other potential creditors such as tax and other governmental authorities that may have priority. Moreover, as the investors do not have a perfected security interest in the treasuries, the claim may be challenged in court causing an extended timeline for recovery of potentially many years.</p>\n<p>In the case of a 3(c)(7) fund, unlike a BVI fund, this is an exempt offering with no oversight by any regulatory authority. Investors’ claims to the underlying assets will be based on contractual terms alone which can be challenged in court leading again to potentially long delays for recovery. Moreover, a US bankruptcy authority would have wide powers including the ability to challenge asset transfers made during a suspect period. This means redemptions from the 3(c)(7) fund occurring up to 90 days prior to bankruptcy can be voided and reversed as the crypto markets have seen occurring with the clawbacks in the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-seeks-claw-back-2-billion-customer-withdrawals\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Celsius</a> bankruptcy.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/9/796f0540e9d46c710dfeaed18ccad7970ae5fcb1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hkfDkeiLoO3gBu2A1kx1NQ5J2XT.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-09-13 at 7.02.26 AM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/9/796f0540e9d46c710dfeaed18ccad7970ae5fcb1_2_690x258.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-13 at 7.02.26 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"hkfDkeiLoO3gBu2A1kx1NQ5J2XT\" width=\"690\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/9/796f0540e9d46c710dfeaed18ccad7970ae5fcb1_2_690x258.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/9/796f0540e9d46c710dfeaed18ccad7970ae5fcb1_2_1035x387.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/9/796f0540e9d46c710dfeaed18ccad7970ae5fcb1_2_1380x516.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEEDEB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-2-what-regulatory-bodies-oversee-the-product-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-2-what-regulatory-bodies-oversee-the-product-26\"></a>2.

Describe the technical implementation of your product</h3>\n<p>The Centrifuge protocol has a few key components:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Asset-level tokenization</strong>: Centrifuge asset pools are made up of individually tokenized real-world assets. This supports a range of asset types, from Treasury bills such as with the LTF pool, to real-estate assets such as the New Silver pool and ABS such as BlockTower, to any other asset. The asset-level tokenization enables a deep level of transparency and automated reporting for funds building on Centrifuge.<br>\n<strong>2. Liquidity pools</strong>: For each asset pool, there can be liquidity pools, deployed on multiple blockchain networks, and with multiple assets. Today, LTF is live on Ethereum, Base and Celo (more coming), and supports USDC and FRAX. Through this architecture, other assets including USDS can easily be added.<br>\n<strong>3. ERC-7540 support</strong>: Each liquidity pool is fully compliant with the recently finalized asynchronous version of ERC-4626. This standardizes asynchronous investments and redemptions, perfect for RWAs. On top of this, features can be built such as automated allocation management across asset classes, or automated redemptions.</p>\n<p>Each fund share is tokenized as a standard ERC-20 token, with transfer restrictions built in (based on the ERC-1404 standard). The restrictions are managed by the fund administrator and stored onchain in a member list contract.</p>\n<p>Onchain smart contracts are also used for the entire flow-of-funds, ensuring that funds can only be transferred between investors, the Centrifuge protocol, and the fund’s on/off-ramp accounts.</p>\n<p>The price of the ERC-20 token is based on an onchain NAV calculation, which uses the asset-level tokenization to aggregate the prices from the individual assets. The prices are set directly by the fund administrator. Soon, Chronicle will also launch the RWA oracle for the LTF token, which will add additional third-party verification to the NAV &amp; onchain prices.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-38\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-38\"></a>5.

Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</h3>\n<p>The Centrifuge and Maker relationship is an industry-defining partnership that exemplifies a culture of collaboration and success. Currently, 75% of Maker’s tokenized RWA AUM is held through the Centrifuge platform. Maker has backed nearly $600M worth of DAI with RWAs tokenized by Centrifuge since 2021.</p>\n<p>The vision of the Maker ecosystem has always been towards offering <a href=\"https://medium.com/@MakerDAO/stablecoins-use-cases-44e696ba8633\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">real world impact</a>, and Centrifuge is one of the <a href=\"https://medium.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-tinlake-adding-real-world-assets-to-mcd-68cbcb67e9a4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">earliest</a> partners to have taken that challenge <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/using-tranches-to-insure-against-defaults-of-real-world-assets-and-providing-an-extremely-stable-asset/1286\">head-on</a>. Since the launch of the very first DeFi-funded onchain securitization with <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silver-completes-largest-loan-securitization-133500813.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">New Silver</a>, Maker and Centrifuge have closely collaborated to establish, improve, and ultimately, scale a market of tokenized real world collateral funded by onchain liquidity.</p>\n<p>RWA currently comprises the largest portion of the Maker balance sheet at 46% of the circulating DAI supply; in early 2024 alone, RWAs generated nearly 48% of Maker’s annual revenue (amounting to around $118.5 million out of a total of $245.6 million); Maker’s RWA investment peaked at $2.6 billion in 2023, marking a 267% increase over the previous year; and most critically, over the last two years of a down market, RWAs accounted for almost 80% of Maker’s fee income.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Centrifuge has led RWA discussions in some of the earliest <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/centrifuge-onboarding-rwa-backed-collateral-to-mcd/2721\">collateral onboarding calls</a>, successfully launched <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/rundown\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">six RWA vaults</a>, developed an institutional-grade robust <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/progress-update-on-the-legal-structure-for-centrifuge-rwa-vaults/13307\">legal structure</a>, and led the largest <a href=\"https://medium.com/centrifuge/blocktower-credit-and-makerdao-to-fund-220-million-of-real-world-assets-through-centrifuge-b52d0fab0fee\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">onchain securitization deal</a> with our partner BlockTower - all working hand-in-hand with the Maker contributors, community, and ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Now, with the Endgame fully launched, we continue to emphasize our recent commitment to Sky’s future, as an early member of a proposed <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spring-cluster-introduction-and-proposal/18398\">SubDAO cluster</a> alongside BlockTower and long-time Maker RWA core team members, while also highlighting our desire to continually <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/bringing-transparency-reporting-and-onchain-data-to-real-world-collateral/22051\">iterate and improve</a> on the foundational tenets of our partnership; namely, leveraging the liquidity, transparency, and disruptive potential of crypto for the financing of real-world assets, all tokenized onchain.</p>\n<p>Outside of Maker, we have steadily built a reputation as go-to-partner for Decentralized Institutions, with the launch of Centrifuge Prime, and successful relationships with Aave, Gnosis, and Frax, among other leading DeFi protocols and DAOs.</p>\n<p>We are proud to be a longstanding partner to the Maker and larger DeFi ecosystem, and we view this proposal as a critical continuation of the RWA journey with Sky.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-2-beyond-yield-how-might-your-product-benefit-the-sparkdao-andor-makerdao-ecosystem-41\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-2-beyond-yield-how-might-your-product-benefit-the-sparkdao-andor-makerdao-ecosystem-41\"></a>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</h3>\n<p>Centrifuge is uniquely positioned as a key partner within the Sky ecosystem, offering comprehensive support as both a platform and product partner. Unlike many of our industry counterparts that are tied to a single asset manager, Centrifuge operates as a decentralized protocol, enabling us to collaborate seamlessly with other decentralized protocols and ecosystems. With our deep expertise in the Sky ecosystem, we believe our platform and technology are exceptionally well-suited to enhance and strengthen both the Sky and Spark ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>Centrifuge as a Platform Partner</strong><br>\nWith our extensive familiarity with the Sky ecosystem, Centrifuge offers unmatched platform capabilities that can be seamlessly integrated into Sky’s infrastructure and operations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Modular Tokenization at Scale</strong>: Our platform is built to be scalable and adaptive with a flexible and adaptive securitization engine, multi-chain architecture to aggregate liquidity across networks, and customizable investor management components. These features allow us to tailor solutions to specific protocol needs, including compliance and third-party integrations, providing a robust foundation for managing real-world assets onchain.</li>\n<li><strong>Primitives that Enable Full Transparency and Automation</strong>: Centrifuge is designed to bring the entire portfolio management process onchain, enhancing transparency and automation. We provide the necessary primitives—from onchain data structures to offchain API integrations—to tokenize the entire stack of RWAs. This capability can be harnessed for advanced reporting within the Sky ecosystem, automating liquidity management, and integrating directly with Atlas components, such as onchain Asset-Liability Management structures.</li>\n<li><strong>Active Ecosystem Contributor</strong>: As an active partner within the Web3 space and a long-standing contributor to DeFi, Centrifuge is well-positioned to support the development and success of the Sky ecosystem. Whether through smart contracts, backend infrastructure, or user interfaces, we are committed to using our technical resources and domain expertise to augment and strengthen the capabilities of Sky’s RWA SubDAO/Star initiatives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We already have active partnerships with key participants in the ecosystem, such as Chronicle Labs, Ankura Trust Company, and many of the third-party RWA service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Centrifuge as a Product Partner</strong></p>\n<p>Centrifuge is uniquely capable and familiar with building products alongside not only DAOs, but specifically with Sky. This deep experience positions us as the ideal partner to craft RWA related products, features, and internal systems that align with the goals of Sky.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We are fully committed to dedicating Centrifuge’s resources—including our legal, marketing, business development, product, and engineering teams—to these efforts.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Lucas Vogelsang, Centrifuge</em></p>\n<p>When developing new products, our focus is on key objectives: increasing demand for DAI/USDS, enhancing utility for DAI/USDS, and growing the SparkLend user base. Leveraging our team of domain experts and strong relationships across both DeFi and traditional finance sectors, we bring these products to market in sustainable and impactful ways. Our goal is to create solutions that not only address immediate needs but also foster long-term growth and stability within the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Below are a series of proposals that we would like to develop with Sky/Spark, this includes:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Proposal</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Function</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>PSM INTEGRATION TO SUPPORT RWA TOKENS</td>\n<td>Centrifuge proposes an enhanced “PSM-like” structure that allows RWA tokens to be swapped for DAI/USDS at the current market price minus a fee. This structure would provide users with instant liquidity, enabling any holder to immediately access DAI or USDS, or convert their DAI/USDS into RWA tokens. By integrating this feature, Centrifuge could significantly enhance liquidity and flexibility within the Sky ecosystem, making it easier for users to interact with real-world assets.</td>\n<td>Add DAI/USDS utility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DAI/USDS ENABLED SUBSCRIPTIONS AND REDEMPTIONS</td>\n<td>Enable DAI/USDS for all Centrifuge subscription and redemption activities, streamlining the process for users to engage with RWAs. This feature would simplify transactions within the ecosystem, further integrating DAI/USDS into the broader financial operations of real-world asset management.</td>\n<td>Add DAI/USDS utility and grow demand</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DIVERSIFIED YIELD SOURCES FOR sDAI (RWA sDAI 2.0)</td>\n<td>Introduce a revamped version of the sDAI savings product, which blends yields from both liquid and illiquid RWA products. This new product, designed with institutional buyers in mind, would be KYC-compliant, allowing Sky to tap into a different segment of capital that requires regulated investment avenues. By expanding the yield offerings in a sustainable and diversified manner, Centrifuge could drive increased demand for DAI/USDS, particularly among institutional investors.</td>\n<td>Grow demand for DAI/USDS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sDAI TERM BONDS</td>\n<td>Offer a savings-like structure that locks DAI/USDS for a specified duration, providing a higher yield in return. sDAI Term Bonds would drive demand for DAI/USDS by offering users an attractive, secure investment option with a fixed term. This product would not only diversify the savings options available within the Sky ecosystem but also ensure a steady demand for DAI/USDS over a longer period.</td>\n<td>Grow demand for DAI/USDS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RWA INTEGRATIONS WITH SPARKLEND</td>\n<td>Following the success of our Morpho deployment, we propose bringing both similar and unique products to SparkLend to integrate with consumer facing fintechs, and allow Spark to collateralize DAI/USDS with higher yielding assets indirectly through lending markets that otherwise may be too volatile to directly hold. This accomplishes all three of the key objectives and attributes TVL to SparkLend itself.</td>\n<td>Grow SparkLend user base, add DAI/USDS utility, and grow DAI/USDS demand</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Through these product offerings, Centrifuge aims to elevate the Sky/Spark ecosystems by integrating real-world assets in ways that are efficient, transparent, and aligned with the long-term goals of both Sky/Spark and its users. Our commitment to leveraging our extensive experience and resources ensures that these products are not just theoretical but can be successfully implemented to drive meaningful value for the entire ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-42\"></a>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</h3>\n<p>Centrifuge has been a leading force within the industry for RWA integrations, consistently at the forefront of DeFi capabilities. We were the first to launch a tokenized integration with DeFi with the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/rwa-market-recap/10888\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWA Market</a> back in 2021. Our latest lending market with Morpho, launched in collaboration with other RWA providers, exemplifies our continued commitment to structuring institutional RWA DeFi arrangements onchain.</p>\n<p>Some highlights of our integration work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Morpho Market</strong>: Our <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/08/27/tokenization-pioneer-centrifuge-unveils-lending-market-with-morpho-coinbase/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWA Lending Market on Morpho</a> represents a groundbreaking deal in DeFi, bringing together a range of technologies from tokenization to identity verification, a mix of RWA providers and assets, and a mix of ecosystem capabilities covering L2 <strong>networks</strong>, externalized risk curation, and DeFi primitives. Built on Coinbase’s Base Layer-2 network, this market allows for the seamless collateralization of RWAs for borrowing. What sets it apart from other efforts in this field is its ability to provide compliant, reliable yield and asset opportunities, in a secure package that appeals to institutional and retail users alike. Built into the market are Coinbase Verifications, a KYC checker built into the Base network, that gate-keep U.S and sanctioned users from lending into the market. This is the first use-case for Verifications in DeFi, furthering the institutional case for finance on smart contract rails.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Morpho and Centrifuge integration exemplifies the best our industry has to offer. It successfully combines all of the technologies that we’ve been working for years to bring together - real-world assets, decentralized lending, onchain identity, smart accounts, and open risk curation - it really is the future of finance.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Paul Frambot, Morpho</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trident Trust</strong>: Our latest <a href=\"https://centrifuge.mirror.xyz/pn5NlZ5UY5pdtOy_FFZ1cNWr0Dn1QBk2yCeJ6ZXQQoc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fund management platform</a> is designed to offer a total solution for credit funds, that seamlessly integrates onchain and offchain data into a unified control panel. Our integration with Trident Trust, an industry leading fund administrator, underscores our <strong>platform’s</strong> ability to automate reporting, streamline operations, and enhance transparency, making it easier for asset managers to transition to onchain finance. With an integration pipeline that covers custodians, other fund administrators, and more third-parties, our fund management platform is how Centrifuge unlocks transparency and operational efficiencies and brings it to the market.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We’re excited to work with Anemoy to build one of the first tokenized, regulated funds that maintains an onchain record of portfolio data and net asset valuations. This increases transparency while streamlining typically burdensome reporting and reconciliation processes.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— David Mungall, Trident Trust</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chronicle</strong>: The Chronicle RWA oracle has been integrated to provide the most credibly verifiable and transparent price feeds for assets on the Centrifuge platform. Our integration <strong>creates</strong> verifiability, not just into the total NAV of the fund, but to the entire portfolio of the fund, including granular asset-level details. This enables stakeholders to continuously track, in a trustless manner, the full movements of cash from the onchain USDS and USDC holdings, to offchain cash balances, to the detailed list of holdings at the LTF’s custodian. This creates a level of transparency that is groundbreaking for RWAs in DeFi.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Our partnership with Centrifuge and Anemoy demonstrates how decentralized oracles can bring a new level of trust and transparency to real-world assets. With Chronicle’s RWA Oracle, investors gain an unopinionated, verifiable view of the LTF, improving their confidence in the asset’s security and stability.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Nik Kunkel, Chronicle</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Archax</strong>: Anemoy has entered into an agreement to integrate LTF in the institutional platform of Archax. Archax is the first ever digital securities exchange regulated by the FCA in London. <strong>Targeted</strong> at institutions, Archax institutional clients will be able to access LTF in the first distribution partnership undertaken by Anemoy. Archax also has its FCA brokerage, custody and crypto permissions.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We are thrilled to be working with Anemoy, Centrifuge and Janus Henderson to offer our users access to tokenized treasury bills. This collaboration reflects our ongoing mission to integrate real-world assets into the onchain ecosystem, empowering our users to diversify their portfolios with institutional-grade products.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Simon Barnby, Archax</em></p>\n<p>We are excited to continue building on this work with Sky. We believe only the Centrifuge platform has proven the capability to unlock RWA and DeFi at a deep foundational level, and our work with our integration partners proves so.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-4-do-you-offer-or-plan-to-offer-other-products-that-could-be-appropriate-for-spark-or-other-subdaos-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-4-do-you-offer-or-plan-to-offer-other-products-that-could-be-appropriate-for-spark-or-other-subdaos-43\"></a>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Centrifuge is proud to share that we have lined up several product opportunities that are a strong fit for the Spark portfolio.</p>\n<p>These products are rooted in our experience with the Maker/Spark ecosystem, with a deep understanding of Spark’s preferred risk tolerances, and aligned around partnerships that accentuate</p>\n<p>In the supplementary documents sent privately to the submissions panel, we offer two new funds specifically tailored to the future investment objectives of Spark.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AAA Highly Liquid Bond Fund targeting returns in excess of Treasuries</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BBB+ Enhanced-Yield Public Credit Fund targeting higher returns for more diversification along the risk curve</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These funds aim to offer forward-looking solutions that help Spark navigate a volatile rate environment and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our objective is to position Spark to capitalize on potential market dislocations over the next 12 to 36 months, and support Spark’s own aspirations to diversify beyond the risk-free rate.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98933-in-summary-44\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-in-summary-44\"></a>In summary</h2>\n<p>Centrifuge, Anemoy, and their partners are uniquely positioned to provide Sky with an innovative, fully integrated, and compliant tokenization solution. Our proven track record, combined with the expertise of strategic partners like Janus Henderson, ensures that we can meet Sky’s current needs and adapt and grow as the market evolves. By leveraging our decentralized infrastructure and deep knowledge of traditional finance, we are confident that this proposal will set a new standard for onchain asset management.</p>\n<p>We are excited about the opportunity to deepen our partnership with Sky and pioneer the next chapter of real-world asset adoption together.

What is the project name?</strong></p>\n<p>Sky Dollar</p>\n<p><strong>2. What is the USDS token?</strong></p>\n<p>USDS is an upgraded version of the DAI token. Upgrading is optional. It is an ERC-20 token with permit functionality and EIP-1271 signature validation. The USDS token also enables two-way conversions between DAI and USDS tokens, using the mint and burn functions of both tokens. The conversion rate of the stablecoin is 1 DAI to 1 USDS.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What is the governance structure of the Sky Protocol and its USDS token?</strong></p>\n<p>The USDS token is the stablecoin token of the Sky Protocol, a decentralized and permissionless protocol formerly known as the Maker Protocol, governed entirely by its community, the Sky Ecosystem (formerly known as MakerDAO). Post dissolution of the Maker Foundation in 2021, the ecosystem continues to remain decentralized.</p>\n<p><strong>4. When will the token migration take place?</strong></p>\n<p>The start of the token migration from DAI to USDS is scheduled for September 18</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the process for migrating from DAI to USDS?</strong></p>\n<p>The migration is conducted using the DAI-USDS Converter contract, which allows two-way conversions between DAI and USDS using the mint and burn functions of both tokens. This process is non-custodial and permissionless, meaning that users retain full control of their assets throughout the conversion.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What is the project website?</strong></p>\n<p>The project is a decentralized and permissionless protocol, meaning there are no official websites; it can be accessed through various gateways including Sky.money and <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\">Spark.fi</a>, while anyone is free to develop new front ends, and users can always interact with the protocol directly through its smart contracts, including those contracts governing the Sky native tokens.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98920-tokenomics-and-supply-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98920-tokenomics-and-supply-2\"></a>Tokenomics and Supply</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Will the migration introduce new tokenomics?</strong></p>\n<p>USDS is meant to replace DAI as the stablecoin of the Sky Protocol, so its function remains the same with the added ability to earn token rewards and to access the Savings Rate.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What is the roadmap for USDS token functionality after the migration?</strong></p>\n<p>Please review the Sky Atlas for additional information on Sky Ecosystem governance approved features.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Specifications</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. What is the token/coin address?</strong></p>\n<p>USDS : 0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F</p>\n<p><strong>2. What platform(s) is your token built on?</strong></p>\n<p>USDS is built on Ethereum, as an ERC-20 token .</p>\n<p><strong>3. Where can I find the smart contract code for USDS tokens?</strong></p>\n<p>The smart contract code can be found in the<a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/usds\"> GitHub repository for MakerDAO</a> .</p>\n<p><strong>4. If you are able to provide a security audit report by a third-party security firm, please provide the URL.</strong></p>\n<p>The audit reports can be accessed<a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/usds/tree/dev/audit\"> here</a> .</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98920-regulatory-and-compliance-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98920-regulatory-and-compliance-3\"></a>Regulatory and Compliance</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Are there any jurisdictional restrictions for using the Sky Protocol and its USDS stablecoin?</strong></p>\n<p>As a decentralized and permissionless protocol, the Sky Protocol itself, including the contracts for its native stablecoin, USDS, and native governance token, SKY, have no inherent jurisdictional restrictions. USDS tokens, and the Sky Protocol, are by design, borderless and accessible to anyone with an internet connection and the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>Independent interfaces that serve as gateways to the Sky Protocol may, at their own discretion, choose to implement their own access restrictions in light of regulatory considerations. However, these restrictions are specific to those interfaces and do not reflect any jurisdictional restrictions imposed by the Sky Protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Some interfaces, such as Sky.money, geo-block or restrict a number of jurisdictions, for some or all of the functions provided by the Sky Protocol. Please see the Sky.money Terms of Use for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Is the token designed to facilitate anonymous, obscured, or privacy-enhancing transactions?</strong></p>\n<p>USDS tokens, being standard ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, have the same level of pseudonymity as any other Ethereum transaction. The Sky Protocol does not add or remove any anonymity features, maintaining the base level of transaction transparency inherent to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98920-resources-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98920-resources-4\"></a>Resources</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://sky.money/\">Sky.money</a> - An independent frontend user interface providing general access to the Sky Ecosystem and product features</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/usds\">Sky Token Smart Contract on GitHub</a> - Smart contract code for USDS</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/usds/tree/dev/audit\">Audit Report on GitHub</a> - Third-party security audit for USDS</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/information-for-usds-integrators/25082\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/information-for-usds-integrators/25082","pubDate":"Fri, 13 Sep 2024 03:35:12 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"Yes","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25082"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/information-for-usds-integrators/25082.rss","#text":"Information for USDS integrators"},"filter":false},{"title":"Attention WBTC Vault and WBTC SparkLend Users","dc:creator":"ecosystem-team","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>This is the first official notice from the Sky Ecosystem regarding the offboarding of WBTC-A, WBTC-B, WBTC-C, and WBTC on SparkLend.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/wbtc-changes-and-risk-mitigation-10-august-2024/24844/26\">proposal</a> to offboard WBTC collateral exposure from the Sky Ecosystem, including Legacy Vault Types and SparkLend, has been initiated by <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the proposal, the offboarding will be conducted in several steps over multiple Executive Votes.

Product Summary</h1>\n<p><strong>The First Native On-chain TBILL Vault</strong><br>\nThe OpenEden Tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills Fund (“<strong>TBILL Fund</strong>” or “<strong>Fund</strong>” or “<strong>Token Issuer</strong>”) is the first regulated U.S Treasury Bills Fund that is offered 24/7/365 on-chain through the <a href=\"https://app.openeden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenEden TBILL Vault</a> (“<strong>OE TBILL Vault</strong>”). The OE TBILL Vault is deployed natively on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and XRPL offering a DeFi UI/UX while offering the most institutional-grade and compliant access to U.S. Treasury Bills (“<strong>T-Bills</strong>”) yield on-chain. Having launched the Fund in April 2023, The TBILL Fund has a 18 months live track record which ranks amongst the longest in the market. The Fund is also an on-chain native vault that utilises smart-contract technologies for settlement.</p>\n<p><strong>A Robust Regulatory-First Approach for a Global Audience</strong><br>\nOpenEden’s TBILL tokens (“<strong>$TBILL</strong>”) are issued by Hill Lights International Ltd (“<strong>TBILL Fund</strong>”), which is a British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission (“<strong>BVIFSC</strong>”) regulated professional fund established under the British Virgin Islands Securities and Investment Business Act 2010. The bankruptcy-remote TBILL Fund is managed by OpenEden’s affiliated entity, Adam Eve Capital Pte Ltd (“<strong>AEC</strong>”) which is a licensed fund management company (LFMC) that holds a Capital Markets Services License under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 and is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“<strong>MAS</strong>”). The investment manager of the TBILL Fund, AEC operates under an investment mandate to invest in short-dated T-Bills. $TBILL tokens of the Fund can be offered to Non-U.S Professional Investors defined under BVI SIBA Act and to U.S Accredited Investors defined under U.S Securities Act of 1993 Rule 501a (the Fund had filed a SEC Form D Notice to offer under Reg D 506c).</p>\n<p><strong>Institutional-grade Foundation with Best-in-Class Partners</strong><br>\nThe TBILL Fund’s portfolio of T-Bills are bought, sold and custodised through the Fund’s licensed Prime Broker, UK FCA registered StoneX Financial Limited, and custodised in the Prime Broker’s licensed sub-custodian, being BNP Paribas Bank, New York in segregated accounts in compliance with UK FAC’s CASS rules. As the Token Issuer is a regulated fund managed by a licensed fund manager, there are stringent regulatory requirements including the appointment of an independent fund administrator to (i) provide independent daily valuation of the $TBILL token’s Net Asset Value (“NAV”); and (ii) participate as an independent multi-sig party for all fund asset transfer transactions as an additional safeguard against fraud. The Fund has also appointed KPMG as its tax advisor and is subject to annual audits on its balance sheet and financials. More recently, the TBILL Fund was awarded an <strong>“A-bf” Bond Fund Rating by Moody’s</strong>, the first and only of any tokenized T-BIlls product globally to receive an “investment-grade” credit rating. The “A” rating from Moody’s is a validation of OpenEden’s dedication to building a reliable primitive for the DeFi ecosystem to access tokenized T-Bills as a source of on-chain yields. <strong>Ernst &amp; Young also completed an independent audit</strong> on the OE TBILL Vault’s critical processes and controls in relation to the TBILL Fund’s KYC/AML procedures, valuation methodologies and the Fund’s asset transfer and custody procedures and controls. OpenEden is proud to have achieved the second highest rating with no critical or high risk findings.</p>\n<p><strong>Truly Crypto-native, Transparent and 24/7/365 Real-time Access</strong><br>\n$TBILL tokens can be minted instantly 24/7/365 on-chain via the OE TBILL Vault using USDC, and $TBILL tokens are held in the investor’s self-custodial wallet. The OE TBILL Vault platform offers real-time, instant on-chain minting of T-Bill backed tokens, thus removing settlement risks and allowing investors to earn yield from the point of minting till the point of redemption, maximising capital efficiency.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Project name: OpenEden Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product name: TBILL (OpenEden Tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills Fund)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product type / underlying asset: U.S. Treasury Bills</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Issuer jurisdiction: British Virgin Islands (Issuer), Singapore (Investment Manager)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product website: <a href=\"https://openeden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://openeden.com/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Primary contact name, title, and method of contact:</p>\n<p>Contact name: Jeremy Ng<br>\nTitle: Co-Founder<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:jeremy.ng@openeden.com\">jeremy.ng@openeden.com</a><br>\nTelegram: <span class=\"mention\">@ly3333</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98909-ii-company-details-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-ii-company-details-2\"></a>II.

Describe the product:</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Proposed Product : OpenEden $TBILL</strong></em><br>\nAs previously explained above in this RFP, the issuer of the $TBILL, being the TBILL Fund, is a registered professional fund (“<strong>Fund</strong>”) established under the British Virgin Islands Securities and Investment Business Act 2010 (“<strong>SIBA</strong>”) and regulated by the BVIFSC. The TBILL Fund is managed by AEC (as defined above), a wholly owned subsidiary of the OpenEden Group, which is a licensed fund management company (LFMC) that holds a Capital Markets Services License (CMSL) under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 and is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The TBILL Fund is rated “A” by Moody’s.</p>\n<p>The TBILL Fund operates the OE TBILL Vault, a smart contract vault that provides investors with direct exposure to a pool of short-dated U.S. T-Bills and overnight reverse repurchase agreements through the minting of the $TBILL. $TBILL is backed 1:1 by short-dated U.S. T-Bills and a small portion of U.S. Dollar (“<strong>USD</strong>”) held in bankruptcy remote segregated accounts in the Fund’s name. $TBILLs can be minted instantly 24/7/365, allowing investors to earn yield backed by the U.S. government on their USDC subscription at the point-of-mint itself, rather than having to wait up to T+2 business days as compared to traditional funds.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault operates on a zero-trust protocol, ensuring that all transactions are fully atomic, automated, transparent and managed on-chain without manual intervention. The protocol smart contract dictates that $TBILL can only be minted in the presence of the underlying asset, USDC, thus ensuring each token is always backed by actual assets. This minimises reliance on trust, making our system more secure and transparent than traditional incumbents. The OE TBILL Vault does not have the capability to freely mint tokens, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised token creation.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault is a permissioned protocol, which means that an investor has to meet specific criteria before the investor is eligible to hold $TBILL issued by the Fund. The OE TBILL Vault is currently only accessible to “Professional Investors’’ as defined under SIBA and to U.S. “Accredited Investors’’ within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act. $TBILL can only be minted and redeemed via the OE TBILL Vault by whitelisted wallets that have been fully onboarded after completing the Fund’s KYC/KYB process. As a permissioned token, $TBILL are transferable between whitelisted wallets.</p>\n<p>The $TBILL token is an EIP-20-compliant representation of an investor’s economic interest in the Fund. By depositing USDC and minting $TBILL, the investor will have legal rights to the redemption value of the net assets held by the Fund, proportional to the amount of $TBILL the investor holds relative to the total outstanding supply of $TBILL. The $TBILL minted by the investor are held in the investor’s whitelisted self custodial wallet.</p>\n<p>Whitelisted investors are also provided with access to the investor dashboard visible on the OE TBILL Vault dApp. The dashboard provides the investor with a real-time view of their $TBILL balance and their realised and unrealised P/L. Please find the sample screenshot of the investor dashboard displayed below.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/A7En9msFzoJcuK6zaU0QmlgBkUB.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_602x499.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"A7En9msFzoJcuK6zaU0QmlgBkUB\" width=\"602\" height=\"499\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_602x499.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_903x748.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_1204x998.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8FAF9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em><strong>Investment strategy</strong></em><br>\nThe Fund aims to provide the highest possible level of income generation while maintaining liquidity and maximum safety of principal.

StoneX’s sub-custodian(s) will not have security or similar rights enabling it to dispose of clients’ safe custody assets except to satisfy obligations incurred by clients, or for payment for services related to the clients’ safe custody assets, meaning that clients’ safe custody assets will not be commingled with StoneX’s assets or exposed to the performance of StoneX’s assets.</em></p>\n<p><em>In providing the custody service, StoneX is subject to the oversight and supervision of its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. The arrangements which StoneX has put in place with its sub-custodian(s) give effect, in particular, to the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority’s CASS Sourcebook, under which StoneX has a regulatory obligation to ensure that any clients’ safe custody assets deposited with a sub-custodian are identifiable separately from its own assets and from the assets of its sub-custodian(s), for the purpose of ring-fencing clients’ assets in order to safeguard their ownership rights.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-5-what-rights-do-token-holders-have-30\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-5-what-rights-do-token-holders-have-30\"></a>5.

The 2023 audited financial statements are available upon request.</p>\n<p>A very important point we wish to highlight is that OpenEden has recently completed an independent audit by Ernst &amp; Young LLP who performed a thorough review of critical aspects of the OE TBILL Vault, which included the investment manager’s policies, controls and procedures concerning AML/KYC, custody and valuation of the Fund’s assets (both digital and TradFi) in accordance with applicable Monetary Authority of Singapore (“<strong>MAS</strong>”) guidelines and leading industry practice for asset managers.</p>\n<p>The design and operations of the following internal controls were reviewed –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Adherence with applicable/relevant MAS Notice and Guidelines on Prevention of Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (“AML/CFT”), including sufficient AML risk assessment methodology focusing on the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Customer due diligence during onboarding and ongoing basis including corroborating source of funds and source of wealth (where applicable)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate Transaction Monitoring processes including transactions involving transfer of digital asset/ stable coin as well as adherence to travel rule (where applicable)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate Name Screening controls (including wallet screening where applicable)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate Suspicious Transaction reporting controls focusing on maintenance of records and timeliness of reporting procedures</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate policies and procedures on the methodology to identify, assess and monitor the enterprise-wide ML/TF risk</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Custody arrangement policies and procedures in place to demonstrate sufficient governance and oversight by Board of Directors /senior management as well as ensuring that independent custodians are suitably licensed, registered or authorised in their respective jurisdictions in line with the requirements from MAS Guidelines on Licensing, Registration and Conduct of Business for Fund Management Companies as well as Securities and Futures (Licensing And Conduct Of Business) Regulations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate controls and oversight is in place for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>the deposit process (i.e. depositing USDC token from customer’s private wallet into custodian account) with appropriate assessment to ensure that custody service provider maintains adequate risk management controls to ensure integrity and security of customer’s digital payment token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the transfer from custodian account to brokerage account process (i.e. transfer of US dollar from custodian account to brokerage account).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the withdrawal process (i.e. USDC token withdrawal from custodial account to customer’s private wallet).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for segregation of customer’s assets from their own assets to mitigate loss or misuse of customer’s assets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate disclosure of custody arrangements, terms and conditions and attendant risks to customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Appropriate segregation of duties to prevent conflict of interests (if applicable), including adherence with limits of authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Valuation policies and procedures in place to demonstrate sufficient governance and oversight by Board of Directors /senior management.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assets under management are subject to independent valuation and customer reporting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate controls and oversight is in place for the calculation of Net Asset Value (“NAV”) by the Fund in accordance with AEC’s Pricing Policy focusing on the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Review the appropriateness of the governance, controls and oversight of the valuation methodology in AEC’s Pricing Policy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review the source of valuation (i.e., the fair value) of each of the three asset components (i.e., US dollar, USDC and US Treasury Bills) that make up the NAV of the TBILL token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate controls and oversight is in place for the review of Net Asset Value calculated by the Fund, including review of the daily reconciliation of the calculation of the NAV by the fund manager which includes reconciliation of the number of TBILL tokens at the Valuation Point.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fund performance reports on Net Asset Value (if applicable) are timely and adequately prepared, reviewed and approved prior to presentation to stakeholder(s).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Upon completion of the review, Ernst &amp; Young assigned a <strong>Satisfactory</strong> rating (being the 2nd highest rating possible) to the independent audit report.

Describe the technical implementation of your product</h3>\n<p><strong>OE TBILL Vault</strong><br>\nThe OE TBILL Vault is developed based on the ERC-4626 Tokenized Vault standard, which is the industry standard for tokenized vaults. Subscriptions and redemption requests are seamlessly and transparently carried out on-chain through the OE TBILL Vault smart contract, which retrieves the latest price from the TBILL price oracle to process the request without manual intervention.</p>\n<p>The smart contract necessitates that $TBILL can only be minted in the presence of the underlying asset, USDC, thus ensuring that each $TBILL token is backed by actual assets. No $TBILL can be minted freely by the smart contract, which eliminates the risk of unauthorised token creation.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault smart contract has the whitelist feature that only allows wallet addresses that have been whitelisted with the smart contract to interact with the smart contract. Consequently, only whitelisted wallets can hold $TBILL. $TBILL can only be transferred between whitelisted wallets.</p>\n<p><strong>$TBILL Token and Token Price</strong><br>\nThe $TBILL is developed based on the ERC-20 token standard, and is minted or burned when USDC is deposited or redeemed from the OE TBILL Vault respectively.</p>\n<p>Token holders earn a return by holding $TBILL, where the token price is expected to increase in value over time. That increment in token price directly reflects the returns generated by the underlying T-Bills portfolio held by the Fund.</p>\n<p>The $TBILL token price is calculated as the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per token. The token price can be derived by dividing the NAV of the Fund by the total outstanding supply of $TBILL. The $TBILL token price was launched with a default value of 1.000000.</p>\n<p><strong>On-Chain Price Oracle</strong><br>\nThe price feed is a service responsible for consolidating and disseminating financial market data to the on-chain price oracle. Its primary function is to precisely calculate the $TBILL token price and transmit price data onto the on-chain price oracle. The integrity of the price feed is ensured through the price guards mechanism.</p>\n<p>Price guards are a circuit breaker mechanism designed to monitor the price of an asset or token and take appropriate actions when the price deviates unexpectedly beyond a predefined threshold. The purpose of the price guard is to protect the OE TBILL Vault or any other system from price manipulation or extreme price fluctuations by halting the OE TBILL Vault.</p>\n<p><strong>On-Chain Governance and Controls</strong><br>\nOpenEden has put in place a robust system of internal controls to uphold the safety of the OE TBILL Vault. These include the implementation of a consensus-based approval mechanism to move the OE TBILL Vault’s assets between venues, timelock, a role-based governance protocol, and multi-layered physical security, among others.</p>\n<p><strong>Timelock</strong> – Timelock implements a safety mechanism during the process of changing the OE TBILL Vault’s treasury wallet address. This is done as a precaution to protect the funds from being drained by a malicious user in the rare occasion when all the multisig wallets are compromised and the hacker is able to switch the address to offramp the funds. This timelock mechanism will give admins a 24-hour window to offramp the funds if the change in treasury address is an unintended one.</p>\n<p><strong>Multisig</strong> – The TBILL Vault is multisig, requiring multiple private keys, including the Fund’s independent third-party fund administrator to authorise and sign off on transactions involving on-chain assets. The use of on-ramp and off-ramp services will also be limited to authorised representatives from the OpenEden team via multisig operations. Off-chain assets, meanwhile, are held on the Fund’s regulated custodians’ platforms, and all actions initiated by any one core team member will require checking and confirmation by another core team member to be authorised. In addition, the Fund’s independent fund administrator will have oversight and governance control over all fund movements involving on-chain and off-chain assets held by the Fund. Even in the event of a smart contract breach or a hack, most of the OE TBILL Vault assets are held with regulated custodians at any given time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-39\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-39\"></a>5.

OpenEden’s $TBILL is currently the only product on the market with an “A” rating by Moody’s and the largest Asia-based issuer of tokenized T-Bills. Furthermore, an allocation into $TBILL would entitle SparkDAO to additional token incentives as OpenEden Group consolidates its plans to launch a governance token in the coming months.</p>\n<p>OpenEden has a network of institutional partners such as State Street, Moody’s etc that can be aligned for an institutional adoption of SparksDAO and its product offerings.</p>\n<p>OpenEden group is very active and dominant in the regions of Asia and Europe, which positions us as the leading non-U.S. tokenized firm that can aid SparksDAO’s international expansion, especially in Asia.</p>\n<p>As the partnership with SparkDAO scales, OpenEden is well-positioned to collaborate with particularly on the launching of new products with an RWA focus due to its end-to-end tokenization suite of services such as issuance, tokenization, portfolio management, and distributions across a variety of blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>OpenEden group also owns a Singapore MAS Licensed Fund Management Company which allows us to be an investment advisor and manager to guide any DAOs, Sub-Daos or treasuries with regulatory-compliance.</p>\n<p>Finally, as tokenized RWAs continue to gain traction, this investment by SparkDAO could galvanise other projects and users in the Sky ecosystem to participate in the growth of tokenized RWAs within the ecosystem, either through direct investments or partnership integrations.

The Sky ecosystem is already heavily reliant on Coinbase’s Custody structure, so this is a natural fit as a preferred replacement.</p>\n<p>BA Labs will comment with details of the onboarding.</p>\n<p>Contract Address: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xcbb7c0000ab88b473b1f5afd9ef808440eed33bf\">0xcbB7C0000aB88B473b1f5aFd9ef808440eed33Bf</a></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sep-12-2024-proposed-changes-to-spark-for-upcoming-spell/25076\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sep-12-2024-proposed-changes-to-spark-for-upcoming-spell/25076","pubDate":"Thu, 12 Sep 2024 14:34:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25076"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sep-12-2024-proposed-changes-to-spark-for-upcoming-spell/25076.rss","#text":"[Sep 12, 2024] Proposed Changes to Spark for Upcoming Spell"},"filter":true},{"title":"Server Error while opening any topic","dc:creator":"0xfish","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Hey everyone, I’m new to the MakerDAO Forum and I’m running into a “Server Error” whenever I try to open any topic.

What is the project name?</strong></p>\n<p>Sky Protocol</p>\n<p><strong>2. What is the SKY token?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY is an upgraded version of the MKR token. Upgrading is optional. It is an ERC-20 token with permit functionality and EIP-1271 signature validation. The SKY token also enables two-way conversions between MKR and SKY tokens, using the mint and burn functions of both tokens. The conversion rate is 1 MKR to 24,000 SKY.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What is the governance structure of the Sky Protocol and its SKY token?</strong></p>\n<p>The SKY token is the governance token of the Sky Protocol, a decentralized and permissionless protocol formerly known as the Maker Protocol, governed entirely by its community, the Sky Ecosystem (formerly known as MakerDAO). After the dissolution of the Maker Foundation in 2021 the ecosystem has remained decentralized and no legal entity is in charge.</p>\n<p><strong>4. When will the token migration take place?</strong></p>\n<p>The start of the token migration is scheduled for September 18.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the process for migrating from MKR to SKY?</strong></p>\n<p>The migration is conducted using the MKR-SKY Converter, which allows two-way conversions between MKR and SKY using the mint and burn functions of both tokens. This process is non-custodial and permissionless, meaning users retain full control of their assets throughout the conversion.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What is the project website?</strong></p>\n<p>The project is a decentralized and permissionless protocol, meaning there are no official websites; it can be accessed through various gateways including <a href=\"https://Sky.money\">Sky.money</a> and <a href=\"https://Spark.fi\">Spark.fi</a>, while anyone is free to develop new front ends, and users can always interact with the protocol directly through its smart contracts, including those governing the Sky native tokens. Maker/Sky features are commonly adopted across the DeFi and crypto space.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98899-tokenomics-and-supply-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98899-tokenomics-and-supply-2\"></a>Tokenomics and Supply</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Will the migration introduce new tokenomics?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY is meant to replace MKR as the governance token of the Sky Protocol (formerly known as the Maker Protocol), so its function remains the same with some added perks to incentivize governance participation. The migration introduces some new tokenomics on top of that. For example, the Sky Protocol will distribute 600 million SKY (approximately 2.56% of the current total supply) per year as rewards to eligible users. This new reward structure incentivizes participation in the protocol and helps to align token holders’ interests.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What is the roadmap for SKY token functionality after the migration?</strong></p>\n<p>Please review the Sky Atlas for additional information on Sky Ecosystem governance approved features.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98899-technical-specifications-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98899-technical-specifications-3\"></a><strong>Technical Specifications</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>1. What is the token/coin address?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY : <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x56072C95FAA701256059aa122697B133aDEd9279\">0x56072C95FAA701256059aa122697B133aDEd9279</a></p>\n<p><strong>2. What platform(s) is your token built on?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY is built on <strong>Ethereum</strong>, as an ERC-20 token.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Where can I find the smart contract code for SKY tokens?</strong></p>\n<p>The smart contract code can be found in the<a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sky\"> GitHub repository for MakerDAO</a> .</p>\n<p><strong>4. If you are able to provide a security audit report by a third-party security firm, please provide the URL.</strong></p>\n<p>The audit reports can be accessed<a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sky/tree/dev/audit\"> here</a> .</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98899-regulatory-and-compliance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98899-regulatory-and-compliance-4\"></a><strong>Regulatory and Compliance</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>1. Are there any jurisdictional restrictions for using the Sky Protocol and its SKY token?</strong></p>\n<p>As a decentralized and permissionless protocol, the Sky Protocol and its native governance token, SKY, have no inherent jurisdictional restrictions. The SKY token and the Sky Protocol are, by design, borderless and accessible to anyone with an internet connection and the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>Independent interfaces that serve as gateways to the Sky Protocol may implement access restrictions in light of regulatory considerations. However, these restrictions are specific to those interfaces and do not reflect any jurisdictional restrictions imposed by the Sky Protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Some interfaces, such as Sky.money, geo-block a number of jurisdictions, including the U.S and the U.K, for some or all of the functions provided by the Sky Protocol. Please see the Sky.money Terms of Use for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Is the token designed to facilitate anonymous, obscured, or privacy-enhancing transactions?</strong></p>\n<p>SKY tokens, being standard ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, have the same level of pseudonymity as any other Ethereum transaction. The Sky Protocol does not add or remove any anonymity features, maintaining the base level of transaction transparency inherent to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the token e-money or a digital representation of fiat currency?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the SKY token is not e-money or a representation of fiat currency. The SKY token is the native governance token of the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://sky.money/\">Sky.money</a> - An independent frontend user interface providing general access to the Sky Ecosystem and product features</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sky\">Sky Token Smart Contract on GitHub</a> - Smart contract code for SKY</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sky/tree/dev/audit\">Audit Report on GitHub</a> - Third-party security audit</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/information-for-sky-integrators/25072\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/information-for-sky-integrators/25072","pubDate":"Thu, 12 Sep 2024 03:54:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"Yes","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25072"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/information-for-sky-integrators/25072.rss","#text":"Information for SKY integrators"},"filter":false},{"title":"New Silver Monthly Report August 2024","dc:creator":"prankstr25","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-002-new-silver-restructuring-risk-and-legal-assessment/21417\">RWA-002 New Silver Restructuring and Risk Assessment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/new-silver-requesting-debt-ceiling-increase/18752\">New Silver Debt Ceiling Increase</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>\n<p>During this reporting period August 1 to August 31, 2024, we financed 16 new loans for the total value of DAI 3,739,171 and repaid 6 loans for total value of DAI 2,367,280.</p>\n<p><strong>Pool-Level Metrics:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of New Loans: 16</li>\n<li>Total New Collateral Funded (DAI): 3,739,171</li>\n<li>Total Collateral Value (DAI): 28,107,201</li>\n<li>Total Number of Assets: 101</li>\n<li>Average Finance Fee (%): 8.47%</li>\n<li>Current Maker Debt Ceiling (DAI): 50M (~56% utilized)</li>\n<li>TIN Subordination / Minimum Subordination: 22.16%/20%</li>\n<li>Number of Loans Repaid (DAI): 6</li>\n<li>Value of Loans Repaid (DAI): 2,367,280</li>\n<li>Cases of Facility EOD: 0</li>\n<li>Cases of Facility In Covenant or Concentration Limit Breach: 0</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Financial Reports</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/4/a479f17813062a8d88c3d41f1da77927b11635bd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nt1zaQjbG0FtMd09Cs1MfBcPARf.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/4/a479f17813062a8d88c3d41f1da77927b11635bd_2_690x371.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"nt1zaQjbG0FtMd09Cs1MfBcPARf\" width=\"690\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/4/a479f17813062a8d88c3d41f1da77927b11635bd_2_690x371.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/4/a479f17813062a8d88c3d41f1da77927b11635bd_2_1035x556.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/a/4/a479f17813062a8d88c3d41f1da77927b11635bd_2_1380x742.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F2F1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Note</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Values reported above and in the Financial Reports may differ slightly due to the time of recording and per second interest accrual method</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disclaimers</p>\n<p>This information is not investment advice, not an offer or solicitation to sell securities.

Our scope expanded with Endgame implementation, which demonstrated a broader need for more robust operational software across the ecosystem. This meant the development of a new platform that could create customizable interactions for organizational data input, along with tools and applications that repurposed, visualized and automated organizational data. This led to the development of Powerhouse’s “document models”, the fundamental data unit of the Powerhouse network, a decentralized synchronization protocol (DocSync), and four applications that leverage these technologies and work seamlessly together.</p>\n<p>As part of our work for Endgame, <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ea-status-update-2-3-powerhouse-work-for-makerdao/24712#rwa-reporting-tool-for-ba-labs-2\">Powerhouse built the RWA Reporting Tool</a> and now the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010\">Atlas Explorer pilot</a>, currently hosted at <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/\">https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/</a> .<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zDDaVoShfz21zsLGOzhRZyV9SmS.png?dl=1\" title=\"Atlas Portal displaying Atlas v2\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_345x272.png\" alt=\"Atlas Portal displaying Atlas v2\" data-base62-sha1=\"zDDaVoShfz21zsLGOzhRZyV9SmS\" width=\"345\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_345x272.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_517x408.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_690x544.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0EEF4\"></a></div><br>\nBoth of these tools make it easier for the broader community to understand granular details about different aspects of Sky’s operations beyond expense reporting - Powerhouse’s first use case. These two new tools show the flexibility of Powerhouse’s document model architecture and the need for customized operational software that can improve the efficiency and transparency of open organizations.<p></p>\n<p>Building on this experience, Powerhouse has begun to find product-market-fit outside of Sky with the launch of <a href=\"http://Arbgrants.com\">Arbgrants.com</a> (more in next section below). The needs of ArbitrumDAO were similar to the Sky Ecosystem albeit in a different operational domain (grants management). For both, there was a need to upgrade their operations, transparency, and data entry and monitoring. Specifically, moving from forums and spreadsheets to a customized web app with native authentication that does not create lock-in through a centralized data provider.</p>\n<p>Building out the grants management for Arbitrum is the beginning of productizing the Powerhouse platform. Yet, grant programs are only one segment of DAO operations. Powerhouse has found reception from other projects on building customized software to optimize their operations. Financial professionals, in particular, <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/ea-status-update-2-3-powerhouse-work-for-makerdao/24712/2\">have responded positively</a> to the availability of the complete revision history for any file, made possible by Powerhouse’s events-based architecture.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98841-arbgrants-enabling-accountability-for-arbitrum-dao-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98841-arbgrants-enabling-accountability-for-arbitrum-dao-3\"></a><strong>ArbGrants: Enabling accountability for Arbitrum DAO</strong></h2>\n<p>With the experience of building the RWA Reporting Tool for Sky, Powerhouse teamed up with StableLab to launch <a href=\"http://ArbGrants.com\">ArbGrants.com</a> in June to monitor Arbitrum’s Long Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP) and in August added the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). Arbitrum has been a leader in the DAO space in distributing grants to projects to encourage building on the protocol.</p>\n<p>Hoping to spur growth on Arbitrum, the DAO approved almost $100m to be distributed to participating projects through LTIPP and STIP, but did not yet have the necessary operational infrastructure to track how these funds were used and their effectiveness. <a href=\"https://stablelab.xyz/\">StableLab</a>, an active governance participant, was tasked with administering these programs. StableLab sought a solution more robust than spreadsheets and forum posts, and thought Powerhouse was the ideal partner.</p>\n<p>Powerhouse had been building a new set of applications to create process-oriented workflows to gather data in a simple and standardized UX, so this project presented an opportunity to build the second use case on the Powerhouse stack (the first being the RWA Reporting Tool for Sky)</p>\n<p>ArbGrants uses <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/renown\">Powerhouse’s Renown product</a> for authentication to ensure that only authorized users can submit ARB incentive reports. It generates a Decentralised Identifier (DID) based on one’s  Ethereum address and issues a credential on Ceramic.

They need legal infrastructure and a business model that can be sustainable for all parts of the ecosystem. We refer to this broader web of legal entities and value flows as a Scalable Network Organization (SNO).</p>\n<p>We have begun validating the SNO model by dogfooding with Powerhouse itself. We have recently set up an Operational Hub for Powerhouse contributors. This legal entity can accept funds from an unincorporated DAO or multisig and pay the service providers of the DAO or SNO. This makes it easy to recruit contributors and easily pay them in crypto or fiat.

In May, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GnRqdoXt8o\">we organized Powerbrunch</a>, an event at Full Node in Berlin to showcase our work. And in July, in preparation for ETHCC, we <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/\">updated our website</a> and unveiled individual pages for each of our four products. In the next month, we will publish a series of blog posts on our core technologies (Document Models and our decentralized synchronization protocol, DocSync) and our public legal infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Now our focus is on reaching more builders and those in the trenches of operations for open organizations. On the development side, we are focused on reducing the cost of creating custom solutions for projects by enhancing the builder experience and improving the system’s stability performance.</p>\n<p>We are planning a side event in Bangkok alongside Devcon to provide an opportunity to grow our developer community by helping builders to play around with document models and DocSync.

What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral?</strong></em></p>\n<p>USYC is being included in major exchanges. By being able to take USYC into treasury, and being an asset that can mint DAI, there appears additional pressure for exchanges to accept DAI as collateral.</p>\n<p>Hashnote will support Maker’s long-terms goals, as we effectively combine the “real” and “decentralized” worlds as well.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98839-legal-questions-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98839-legal-questions-7\"></a><strong>Legal Questions</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>17.

For redemptions, the Fund will remove USYC tokens corresponding to the number of Shares being redeemed from the investor’s Hashnote client wallet. If an investor holds USYC tokens in a whitelisted address, redemptions must be initiated by transferring the equivalent USYC tokens to a designated Fund redemption wallet.</p>\n<p>Transfers of USYC tokens between Hashnote client wallets and/or whitelisted addresses (whitelisted transfers) will be treated as Share transfers between the respective investors and recorded by the Administrator. The Investment Manager allows whitelisted transfers without prior authorization but may annul transfers violating regulatory obligations.</p>\n<p>The Investment Manager may declare non-whitelisted transfers ineffective, annulling them by burning the transferred USYC tokens and minting new tokens to the sender’s wallet.

Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock Short-term Treasury Bill Token (STBT) is designed for accredited investors seeking exposure to US treasury yields. STBT is the first tokenized T-bill token issued in Asia, and currently yields approximately 5.10-5.30% APY on average (gross yield including fees, as of Aug 2024).</p>\n<p>Each STBT is pegged to 1 USD and is collateralized by a combination of the following instruments</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Matrixdock sources from a wide range of independent sources to ensure diversification. Allocations are made dynamically to optimize for stability and liquidity.</p>\n<p>STBT is an ERC-1400 token that distributes yield on a daily basis via re-basing, with T+1 minting and T+0 redemption. T+0 redemption is supported directly by Matrixdock and in secondary venues such as Curve.</p>\n<p>STBT is also the first to accept multiple stablecoins as deposit and redemption options, and <strong>the first to accept minting with DAI directly.</strong></p>\n<p>For STBT, Matrixdock works closely with Chainlink to deliver the best UX on DeFi</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proof of Reserves:</strong> STBT is the market’s first tokenized treasury token adopting Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves, enforcing the number of tokens minted is always less than or equal to the underlying NAV by smart contract, assuring investor confidence on-chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Data feed:</strong> STBT NAV data is recorded publicly on-chain and verified by Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network</li>\n<li><strong>CCIP:</strong> STBT is multi-chain enabled, available on Ethereum and Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>STBT is also committed to driving innovation in token utility. It serves as collateral for borrowing and lending, as well as for leveraging on selected platforms in both DeFi and CeFi, including Term Finance and <a href=\"http://bit.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bit.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>US Treasuries are considered the safest USD-denominated asset. STBT is built upon a basket of on-chain and off-chain instruments, which include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The inclusion of on-chain assets is designed to enhance liquidity and provide added flexibility to the portfolio, complementing the stability of off-chain assets. Based on Matrixdock’s professional asset management experience, allocations are made dynamically to optimize for product yield, stability and liquidity. A small amount of cash is kept to facilitate basic liquidity needs.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the token holder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock distributes yield daily through the rebase of STBT in holders token balances. STBT is pegged to 1 USD, and total STBT supply is increased to reflect increasing NAV.</p>\n<p>Total STBT supply is equivalent to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying asset portfolio, which equates to the sum of the market value of US T-bills, reverse repos, BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and cash.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT adopts a bankruptcy remote SPV structure, where issuer and custodian are separate entities with token holders owning complete legal rights to claim against custodied assets, to ensure 100% fund segregation and investor protection for all token holders.</p>\n<p><strong>Trust:</strong> Prometheus Solutions Purpose Trust (Seychelles)</p>\n<p><strong>Issuer:</strong> Prometheus Solutions Ltd (Seychelles)</p>\n<p><strong>Custodian:</strong> Epimetheus Technologies SPC (Cayman)</p>\n<p><strong>Enforcer/Protector:</strong> Hamilton Services Limited (United Kingdom)</p>\n<p><strong>Brokers:</strong> StoneX (United States), UBS (United Kingdom), Securitize (United States - for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) by BlackRock)</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock sources T-bills from multiple sources off-chain and on-chain. Based on extensive professional asset management experience, Matrixdock allocates dynamically based on asset characteristics to optimise for yield, stability and liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Asset eligibility:</strong> Only assets that are US Treasuries within 3 month maturities, tokens representing US Treasuries, Repos and Cash are eligible for STBT.</p>\n<p>Currently, STBT accepts the following assets</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the use of hedging or derivatives is not permitted. The underlying portfolio only accepts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A small amount of cash is kept to facilitate basic liquidity needs.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Flow of funds</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock supports minting and redemption in USDC, USDT and DAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Minting</strong></p>\n<p>There are multiple routes for minting STBT. The user can either;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Submit OTC request and send stablecoins to designated deposit address</li>\n<li>Deposit eligible ERC20 stablecoin on <a href=\"https://app.matrixdock.com/swap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Matrixdock Web App</a></li>\n<li>Swap on <a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-279/deposit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">STBT Curve-3pool</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>For large quantities ($1M+), we recommend option 1. After receiving the deposit, the STBT Issuer converts stablecoin into USD and transfers it to the Custodian’s bank / broker account. Once the T-bill order is confirmed, STBT NAV is updated, concurrently STBT is minted and sent to the user’s whitelisted wallet address.</p>\n<p><strong>Proof of Reserves:</strong> STBT users are assured that every STBT minted is backed by at least 1 USD of real assets - enforced by smart contract safeguards using Chainlink Oracles and NAV data feeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Redemptions</strong></p>\n<p>Similarly, the user has multiple routes for redeeming STBT.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Submit OTC request</li>\n<li>Use the swap widget on <a href=\"https://app.matrixdock.com/swap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Matrixdock Web App</a></li>\n<li>Swap on <a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-279/deposit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">STBT Curve-3pool</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the Issuer receives the redemption request from the user, open T-bill / repo positions are closed and settled. After bank/broker confirmation, the settled USD is converted into eligible ERC 20 stablecoins. STBT is burned and stablecoins are transferred to the user’s whitelisted address.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the graphic below for fund flow.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/7/f74343547ea21983c8cc14f49b431c9d997eb3e8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zho2P1jpzciDvY25QymtFMe259m.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/7/f74343547ea21983c8cc14f49b431c9d997eb3e8_2_624x349.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"zho2P1jpzciDvY25QymtFMe259m\" width=\"624\" height=\"349\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/7/f74343547ea21983c8cc14f49b431c9d997eb3e8_2_624x349.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/7/f74343547ea21983c8cc14f49b431c9d997eb3e8_2_936x523.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/7/f74343547ea21983c8cc14f49b431c9d997eb3e8_2_1248x698.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E6E4E6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>15. Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, Matrixdock adopts a hybrid allocation approach to optimize for STBT yield, stability and liquidity. Matrixdock has partnered with the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency - supporting T+1 minting and T+0 redemptions.</p>\n<p>For instant redemption, redeemed STBT are swapped into the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on-chain then into USDC (rather than settled off-chain from T-bills).</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, Matrixdock supports a $3M STBT-3pool on Curve to facilitate immediate swaps.</p>\n<p>One advantage with Matrixdock is its established network of relationships with liquidity providers, market makers and institutions. Matrixdock has a proven track record of supporting significant single day redemptions of up to $50M even outside market hours.</p>\n<p><strong>16. With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock supports USDC, USDT and DAI for subscriptions and redemptions. Fiat is also accepted, subject to OTC terms and fees. Matrixdock can also support licensed legally-compliant third party OTCs.</p>\n<p>Matrixdock acknowledges that MakerDao has rebranded into Sky, and will be upgrading DAI to USDS. With a successful DeFi treasury allocation, Matrixdock can accelerate USDS support within the Matrixport ecosystem and directly as a subscription/redemption currency for STBT.</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is increasingly being used in treasury management by institutional investors and DAOs.</p>\n<p>For future development, Matrixdock will focus on four fronts</p>\n<p><strong>i. Greater Efficiencies:</strong></p>\n<p>By partnering with top-tier custodians, Matrixdock will enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and mitigate risk. This global approach ensures that our assets are safeguarded across multiple jurisdictions, delivering superior security standards while optimizing asset management processes.</p>\n<p><strong>ii. More Diverse User Base:</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock will grow the STBT user base by forming strategic partnerships with top-tier institutional platforms and digital exchanges. As the user base expands, the whitelist pool will grow, allowing more users to transact with each other. This whitelisting mechanism ensures that only approved users can hold and trade STBT tokens within the secure, compliant ecosystem. By broadening the pool of whitelisted users, we aim to enhance the liquidity and accessibility of STBT, fostering a more dynamic and diverse marketplace. By expanding the network of compliant users, Matrixdock aims to foster collaboration and unlock additional growth potential within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>iii. Deeper Liquidity:</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock is committed to deepening liquidity by increasing partnerships with top liquidity providers and market makers. Additionally, we plan to scale our Curve pool and raise transaction caps, ensuring seamless liquidity, even during periods of heightened demand.</p>\n<p><strong>iv. Greater DeFi Utility:</strong></p>\n<p>To expand DeFi utility, Matrixdock plans to integrate STBT with leading decentralized protocols, positioning it as a strong collateral option for lending and perpetual markets. Additionally, we envision STBT being used as an underlying asset for other innovative products, such as yield-generating strategies and structured financial instruments, further enhancing its versatility and value across the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<h1>IV.

This means that, even in the unlikely event of Matrixdock’s insolvency, the assets held by the STBT entities would remain fully protected and would not be subject to any claims from Matrixdock’s creditors.</p>\n<p>The STBT entities are designed as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that exclusively manage the STBT program. These entities incur no liabilities other than their obligations to STBT token holders, which are their sole focus. Additionally, the number of STBT tokens issued will always be less than the value of the underlying reserves held by these entities.</p>\n<p>With these safeguards in place, the STBT entities are considered bankruptcy remote, ensuring maximum security for token holders. This legal structure provides a robust level of protection, isolating the assets backing the STBT tokens from any potential risks associated with Matrixdock.</p>\n<p>For further details about these entities, please feel free to request additional information via email.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Holders of STBT tokens have a right to a debt obligation from the token issuer. Each STBT token is redeemable for an amount equivalent to one U.S. dollar, minus any applicable fees, trading losses, or transactional costs. The redemption value reflects the pro rata value of the underlying assets at the time of redemption.</p>\n<p>When you redeem your STBT tokens, the amount you receive will be based on the value of the underlying assets at that time, after accounting for any necessary fees and costs associated with the sale of these assets. Please note that there may be additional redemption restrictions that apply.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No, there are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is subject to taxation at the user’s applicable tax rate, which depends on the user’s jurisdiction and legal setup.

Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract Framework</strong></p>\n<p>The permission framework of the STBT contract is broadly classified into three distinct roles: ControllerRole, IssuerRole, ModeratorRole. The proposal is to designate a single smart contract with a timelock function as the controller contract for all three roles. All STBT administrator activities are carried out via this controller contract, with each operation subject to two stages of proposing and executing, and the execution must conform to the delay specified by the timelock. The overall structure is as follows:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uqnHKuANHGaxVE9y1XMcwsk1uRW.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_624x351.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uqnHKuANHGaxVE9y1XMcwsk1uRW\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_624x351.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_936x526.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_1248x702.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F6FC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Timelock contract: There is a single external control smart contract with a timelock function as the controller contract, through which all STBT administrator activities are carried out. Each operation must go through two stages of proposing and executing, with execution conforming to the 4-hour delay specified by the timelock.</p>\n<p>The timelock contract is the only admin, and the security of the STBT contract is normalized to the security of each role involved in the timelock controller: proposer, executor, and canceller. The canceller is one self-hosted hardware wallet that is authorized to cancel an operation scheduled during the timelock period by calling the timelock controller.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Standard</strong></p>\n<p>ERC1400 standard is split into several modular sub-standards：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ERC1410 defines partially fungible tokens where balances of tokens can have an associated metadata</li>\n<li>ERC1594 defines transfer restrictions and core security token functionality</li>\n<li>ERC1643 defines document management functionality.</li>\n<li>ERC1644 defines controller operation functionality</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular, the STBT token contract implements the ERC1594 transfer restrictions specs, and the ERC1644 controller operations specs. STBT utilizes the whitelist mechanism to determine whether transmission and reception of addresses are authorized.</p>\n<p><strong>STBT Risk Mitigation and Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>STBT mitigates contract and operational risks through the implementation of a whitelist mechanism, time-lock contracts, and an independent real-time monitoring system, ensuring the highest level of safety and security.</p>\n<p>In order to further prevent operational and hacking risks, Matrixdock has implemented two separated sets of monitoring systems:</p>\n<p>A. The first system monitors the difference between the business order data and the contract activity data to detect any unauthorized minting of STBT tokens. Any suspicious activity can be immediately canceled, and emergency plans activated.</p>\n<p>B. The second system monitors the difference between the confirmation fiat wiring amount and the contract activity data. This monitoring service is independently maintained and monitored to identify any anomaly.</p>\n<p>The STBT minter contract only allows whitelisted wallets to call this contract directly and mint/redeem STBT. In this way, all key actions initiated through the minter contract, such as Mint, Burn, Settle, will be transparently tracked on-chain, ensuring full transparency and allowing for the tracking of all capital flows and information related to the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT’s smart contract has been audited by BlockSec (Jan 2023) and <a href=\"http://Zellic.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Zellic.io</a> (Feb 2023).

Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>While Matrixdock itself has not yet engaged directly with MakerDAO in formal partnerships, our parent company, Matrixport, has a deep-rooted history in the crypto and blockchain space. Matrixport’s extensive experience in managing complex crypto financial products and infrastructure has provided Matrixdock with valuable insights into the operational dynamics of decentralized platforms. Over the years, Matrixport has maintained a positive relationship with MakerDAO, entering exploratory discussions on multiple fronts, including but not limited to Real-World Assets (RWA).</p>\n<p>Recognizing MakerDAO’s significant influence in the DeFi space, we have made the strategic decision to accept DAI as the token for minting STBT. This decision underscores our commitment to aligning with MakerDAO’s ecosystem and catering to its extensive user base.</p>\n<p>With our team’s expertise in navigating both traditional finance and digital assets, we are well-positioned to collaborate with DAOs. Our proven track record with other reputable DAOs demonstrates our ability to navigate DAO governance, meet KYC requirements, and deliver financial products that uphold the high transparency and security standards demanded by decentralized organizations like MakerDAO. Matrixdock also has experience working with a wide range of legal structures, including LLPs, corporations, trusts, and other legal entities, further reinforcing our capability to support MakerDAO’s strategic objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT brings more than just yield to the MakerDAO ecosystem. By integrating STBT into MakerDAO’s treasury, MakerDAO gains access to a robust, real-world asset-backed product that enhances overall treasury stability and liquidity. Our industry-leading transparency practices, including the unique Transparency Panel and Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves, reinforce the trust and reliability that MakerDAO’s stakeholders expect.</p>\n<p>Importantly, STBT can also be minted using DAI, MakerDAO’s stablecoin. This creates a seamless integration that not only strengthens the utility and demand for DAI but also allows MakerDAO to leverage its own stablecoin in acquiring STBT, further solidifying its role in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In addition to STBT, Matrixdock is committed to expanding its portfolio of real-world asset (RWA) products, further deepening our collaboration with MakerDAO in the future. By launching new RWA offerings tailored to the needs of decentralized ecosystems, we aim to provide MakerDAO with a broader range of asset-backed products that enhance stability and liquidity. This evolving suite of RWA solutions will not only support MakerDAO’s treasury diversification goals but also create new opportunities for long-term cooperation and growth within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Integrating STBT can also attract a broader range of institutional and retail participants from Matrixport’s ecosystem, who prioritize the security and stability of RWA-backed assets. Additionally, MakerDAO can leverage Matrixdock’s extensive RWA network in Asia, gaining access to traditional finance resources like Asia OTC, asset sourcing, and community building.</p>\n<p>This broader participation could help to further diversify and strengthen MakerDAO’s treasury, aligning with long-term strategic goals of risk management and capital efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is designed with secure interoperability in mind, and it is already integrated into different DeFi verticals such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DEX for swaps and liquidity provisioning ie Curve</li>\n<li>Collateral for stablecoins ie Verified USD</li>\n<li>Collateral for borrowing/lending ie Term Finance</li>\n<li>Multi-chain mobility ie CCIP including Ethereum and Arbitrum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond DeFi, STBT’s compatibility with traditional financial systems is facilitated through our OTC network and a growing range of RWA products, which is part of our broader strategy to create a seamless interface between fiat and crypto worlds. Matrixdock’s infrastructure is built to support easy integration across multiple platforms, ensuring that STBT remains a versatile and secure asset within both DeFi and traditional finance ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Matrixdock is committed to bringing the best-in-quality real-world assets on-chain, with the T-bill token being just the beginning of our journey in RWAs. We are actively developing a suite of tokenized RWAs designed to meet the specific needs of decentralized ecosystems. Our vision is to expand our offerings with a range of products tailored to the diverse risk preferences of MakerDAO ecosystem participants.</p>\n<p>These upcoming products will provide portfolio managers with a broader spectrum of investment options, making them ideal for SparkDAO and other MakerDAO subDAOs seeking to diversify their treasury assets, optimize returns, and enhance capital efficiency. Our dedication to security, transparency, and seamless integration of real-world assets positions us as a key partner in supporting MakerDAO’s treasury management with the highest standards of innovation and stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Supplementary</strong></p>\n<p>STBT Transparency Panel is the first in the industry to leverage on recognized third-party independent oversight to enhance greater transparency. The panel consists of reputable members from Verified USD Foundation, LayerZero Labs and Curve Finance. Panel members provide third-party verification of off-chain assets through direct view-only access of STBT’s bank and broker accounts. Monthly updates are published on the STBT website transparency page.</p>\n<p>Should STBT be a successful inclusion to the Spark Grand Prix, it would be possible for an appointed member of MakerDAO to join the Transparency Panel.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-matrixdock-stbt/25048\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-matrixdock-stbt/25048","pubDate":"Tue, 10 Sep 2024 14:31:33 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25048"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-matrixdock-stbt/25048.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Matrixdock STBT"},"filter":false},{"title":"SPARK impact in MKR Valuation","dc:creator":"Jesus_Perez","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>I’d like to share a reflection on the impact of SPARK on the valuation of MKR (SKY), and I’m happy to receive any feedback.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://mirror.xyz/0x3e0cf03f718520F30300266dcF4DB50bA12d3331/_6xssoujIjPqNParNAZWY59iGoCPNjRDJSRfC3z0osc\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/6/16c62f0ed3507d33fc3bb5ce36fb77f047d33f7a.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"489FFF\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0x3e0cf03f718520F30300266dcF4DB50bA12d3331/_6xssoujIjPqNParNAZWY59iGoCPNjRDJSRfC3z0osc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">mirror.xyz</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/345;\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/1/8130bb0f6012bc34e644ea9d6ef925df1278b574_2_690x345.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"6371DF\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0x3e0cf03f718520F30300266dcF4DB50bA12d3331/_6xssoujIjPqNParNAZWY59iGoCPNjRDJSRfC3z0osc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark and MakerDAO</a></h3>\n\n  <p>While performing the exercise of valuing MKR tokens ahead of the SKY launch, one of the key questions to ask is what value the token captures from the launch of all these projects.

name=\"p-98784-introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://x.com/SkyEcosystem/status/1828405625828843710\">Sky Ecosystem Launch Announcement</a> on August 27, 2024, Sky has officially entered Launch Season. As we proceed with the Token and Product Launch, which is the beginning spell of many upcoming upgrades to the protocol, it is essential for the Sky Ecosystem to finalize and agree on a set of key parameters. In this post, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> provides an overview of the initial set of necessary changes and additions to the protocol, specified in the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/endgame-announcing-the-token-and-product-launch/25021/1\">Endgame: Announcing the Token and Product Launch forum post</a>.</p>\n<p>This proposal assumes the ratification of the upcoming <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010\">Atlas V2 Upgrade</a>, which will be polled at the same time as this parameter proposal, meaning that the upgrade is based on the decentralized governance process of the Sky Ecosystem. Assuming the passing of mentioned Atlas V2 Upgrade and this parameter proposal, the parameters will be included in the Out-of-Schedule executive vote on September 13, as requested by the Stability Facilitator, assuming their final confirmation and satisfaction regarding recommended details below. The Executive Vote will utilize the schedule method, which allows for the spell to be executed after a specified time, which still requires the GSM delay passing.</p>\n<p>In summary, this post covers the following items (find attached corresponding GitHub Repos, which include README files that explain all technical details):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Token contracts and corresponding token converters\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sdai/tree/susds\">USDS</a> (Upgraded DAI)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sky\">SKY</a> (Upgraded MKR)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The introduction of the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sdai/tree/snst\">Sky Savings Rate (sUSDS)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-flappers/tree/dev\">Smart Burn Engine</a> upgrade and <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/univ2-pool-migrator\">pool migration</a> to the new tokens</li>\n<li>The introduction of <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/endgame-toolkit/blob/master/README.md#farms\">Sky Token Rewards (STR)</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Use USDS to get SKY</li>\n<li>Use USDS to get 01 rewardsToken</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.8.2_Governance_Security_Delay_Requirements-9349994e-9918-494c-9e9a-e993082ae055%7C0db30758\">GSM Delay</a> Changes</li>\n<li>Corresponding <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/\">Atlas V2</a> Active Data Updates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about Launch Season, refer to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/makerdao-endgame-launch-season-final/24740\">MakerDAO Endgame: Launch Season (final)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959\">Sky has arrived!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010\">Atlas V2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/endgame-announcing-the-token-and-product-launch/25021/1\">Endgame: Announcing the Token and Product Launch forum post</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98784-summary-of-deployments-and-proposed-parameters-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-summary-of-deployments-and-proposed-parameters-2\"></a>Summary of Deployments and Proposed Parameters</h2>\n<p>BA Labs, acting as Stability Scope Advisor, recommends the Stability Facilitator to include the following parameter changes and contract initializations in a Governance Poll.

While DAI will remain active, users will be able to upgrade to USDS if they wish to access all the new features in the Sky Ecosystem. Similarly, users will be able to convert USDS to DAI. The exchange rate for DAI/USDS will be 1:1. It is important to note that USDS is upgradable by the decentralized governance process of the Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Learn more about USDS and its associated contracts in the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/nst?tab=readme-ov-file#nst-token-and-contracts-associated\">USDS Github repository</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>SKY:</strong> SKY is the new governance token associated with the Sky Ecosystem. MKR will remain active and users will be able to upgrade MKR and SKY (and optionally convert back to MKR) using the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/ngt?tab=readme-ov-file#mkrngt\">MkrSky converter</a>. The MKR/SKY exchange rate will be 1:24,000. The SKY token is not upgradable.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the SKY token and its associated contracts in the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/ngt\">SKY Github repository</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>sUSDS:</strong> sUSDS is a tokenized implementation of the Sky Savings Rate (SSR). To access the Sky Savings Rate (SSR) and accumulate additional USDS, users supply USDS and receive sUSDS in return.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.3.2.2.3.1_Sky_Savings_Rate_Formula-82f9fb39-cc69-4bde-bb0f-ec34ca02ad28%7C57eab733e951bb59\">Atlas V2 A.3.2.2.3.1</a>, the Sky Savings Rate (SSR) formula is: Dai Savings Rate (DSR) + <code>USDS Spread</code>. The <code>USDS Spread</code> value is 0.25%. At the time of writing, the DSR is 6%, which means that the initial SSR value will be 6.25%.</p>\n<p>Learn more about sUSDS in the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sdai/tree/susds\">sUSDS Github repository</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98784-pool-migration-and-flapper-init-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-pool-migration-and-flapper-init-5\"></a>Pool Migration and Flapper Init</h3>\n<p>In order for the Smart Burn Engine to support USDS and SKY, a number of contract deployments and parameter changes are needed. These are outlined below.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98784-pool-migration-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-pool-migration-6\"></a>Pool Migration</h4>\n<p>The pool migration will initiate after the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/univ2-pool-migrator\">univ2-pool-migrator</a> script has been called. It is also worth noting that all funds will be migrated at once without any seed liquidity, since it is not required as was the case when Smart Burn Engine was first initiated.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the pool migration, refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/univ2-pool-migrator\">univ2-pool-migrator Github repository</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98784-flapper-initialization-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-flapper-initialization-7\"></a>Flapper Initialization</h4>\n<p>Similar to the functionality of the existing Smart Burn Engine, Sky’s new Dss Flappers can exchange surplus USDS to SKY, and optionally add both USDS and SKY to a USDS/SKY UniswapV2 pool. With the new implementation, some key changes will be made, outlined below.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"p-98784-splitter-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-splitter-8\"></a>Splitter</h5>\n<p>As opposed to the old SBE design, where a <code>kick</code> operation leads to <code>DAI</code> being withdrawn from the <code>vow</code> and subsequently used to buy <code>gem</code> tokens on Uniswap V2, the new SBE design first goes through the <code>splitter</code>. The <code>splitter</code> exposes a <code>kick</code> operation to be triggered periodically (determined by the <code>hop</code> parameter). When triggered, <code>USDS</code> is withdrawn from the <code>vow</code> and split into two parts: (i) a <code>burn</code> part, which is sent to the underlying <code>flapper</code> contract, and (ii) a <code>WAD - burn</code> part, which can be distributed to a <code>farm</code> contract. The <code>farm</code> is related to Sealed Activation Rewards and is not related to Sky Token Rewards which are part of this spell.</p>\n<p>Another important change compared to previous SBE design, is that Splitter does not match proceeds of using USDS with additional USDS. In the previous design, a <code>bump</code> value of 65,000 actually results in approximately 130,000 (less the price impact) units used per <code>hop</code>, while the upcoming Splitter based design, the <code>bump</code> of 65,000 units results in exactly 65,000 units used. Due to this change in smart contract design, the proposed <code>bump</code> parameter of 65,000 DAI (USDS in practice) will effectively halve the Rate of SKY Accumulation compared to current configuration, even though the actual parameter values will remain the same.</p>\n<p>This alteration is compliant with the language of <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.3.5.1.1.2.1_Rate_Of_SKY_Accumulation-5c7ed3bd-def3-423c-990d-49c9665f6c9d%7C57ea2c549207d9fee003\">Atlas V2 A.3.5.1.1.2.1 - Rate of SKY Accumulation</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the language of the Atlas V2, there are additional changes required for SBE, but due to already complex alterations to the SBE in this proposal, including liquidity migration, additional changes will be proposed via another SBE related proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Splitter Parameters:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>burn</code>: The percentage of the <code>vow.bump</code> to be moved to the underlying <code>flapper</code>. For example, a value of 0.70 * <code>WAD</code> corresponds to funneling 70% of the <code>USDS</code> to the burn engine. Will initially be set to <code>100% (1.0 * WAD)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>hop</code>: Minimum interval in seconds between kicks. Will initially be set to 10,249 seconds.</li>\n<li><code>flapper</code>: The underlying burned strategy. Will initially be set to <code>FlapperUniV2</code>.</li>\n<li><code>farm</code>: The staking rewards contract receiving the rewards, which will be defined in a later phase when Sealed Activation will be implemented.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><a name=\"p-98784-flapper-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-flapper-9\"></a>Flapper</h5>\n<p>The <code>flapper</code> is the underlying burner strategy of the SBE. There are currently two strategies defined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-flappers/tree/dev\">Dss Flappers Github repository</a>. <code>FlapperUniV2</code> will remain the chosen <code>flapper</code> strategy. Furthermore, the <code>receiver</code> address will remain the <code>MCD_PAUSE_PROXY: 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>FlapperUniV2 Parameters:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pip</code>: A reference price oracle, used for bounding the exchange rate of the swap.</li>\n<li><code>want</code>: Relative multiplier of the reference price needed for the swap. For example, 0.98 * WAD allows for a 2% worse price than the oracle price. Will initially be set to <code>0.98</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><a name=\"p-98784-splittermom-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-splittermom-10\"></a>SplitterMom</h5>\n<p>A new Mom contract has been developed for the Smart Burn Engine in the Sky Ecosystem, referred to as <code>SplitterMom</code>. This contract allows bypassing the governance delay when disabling the Splitter in an emergency.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"p-98784-oraclewrapper-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-oraclewrapper-11\"></a>OracleWrapper</h5>\n<p>Allows for scaling down an oracle price by a certain value. This can be useful when the <code>gem</code> is a redenominated version of an existing token, which already has a reliable oracle.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the Flapper initialization, refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-flappers/tree/dev\">Dss Flappers Github repository</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98784-sky-token-rewards-str-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-sky-token-rewards-str-12\"></a>Sky Token Rewards (STR)</h3>\n<p>When USDS is deposited to farm other Sky Ecosystem tokens, it is referred to as “Sky Token Rewards” (STR). For the Token and Product Launch, two Sky Token Reward (STR) contracts will be deployed: (i) STR (SKY) and (ii) STR (01 rewardsToken). These are explained in further detail below.</p>\n<p>To learn about Sky Token Rewards (STR), refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/endgame-toolkit/blob/master/README.md#farms\">Endgame Toolkit GitHub Repository</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98784-sky-token-rewards-sky-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-sky-token-rewards-sky-13\"></a>Sky Token Rewards (SKY)</h4>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.4.5.2_USDS_Rewards-84d14606-b3f3-4dc0-8f75-ca8d7128a391%7Cb3415bc1a125\">Atlas V2 A.4.5.2 - USDS Rewards</a>, the planned Token Rewards rate to participating USDS holders will be 600 million SKY tokens per year.</p>\n<p>The cap parameter is defined as the max rate of spending, or in other words, the maximum value for safety. A case can be made to set the cap parameter higher than the planned 600 million SKY tokens per year. Hence, we believe that a value of 800 million SKY per year is appropriate. Such change is subject to decentralizer process of Sky Governance.</p>\n<p>The start date of STR (SKY) is set to be relevant to the spell cast block timestamp minus 7 days, by configuring DssVest which is minting rewards to the staking contract. The accrued token rewards in the DssVest are distributed to the StakingReward contract by calling a permissionless function. The specific DssVest start time configuration prior to spell cast time is due to the nature of algorithm in the StakingRewards contract and frequency of vested tokens being distributed, with intent to normalize SKY Token Rewards yield as soon as possible.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98784-sky-token-rewards-01-rewards-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-sky-token-rewards-01-rewards-14\"></a>Sky Token Rewards (01 Rewards)</h4>\n<p>Similarly to STR (SKY), STR (01 Rewards) will allow USDS holders to deposit USDS to receive 01 rewardsToken over time. On a technical level the rewardsToken is set to <code>address(0)</code>. These Token Rewards will be calculated off-chain and distributed later in time via special contract.

Company Details</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Company description</p>\n<p>Dinari is a tokenized asset issuer providing open access to trusted assets, such as US stocks &amp; ETFs, with fractional shares &amp; dividend distributions. We work with a variety of technology and finance businesses, both web2 and web3 companies, to bring new assets to their customers. Dinari was founded in 2021 and is a registered SEC transfer agent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Key personnel biographies</p>\n<p>Gabriel Otte (CEO): Previously, Gabriel was a biotech founder of Freenome ($10B Biotech), a multi-billion dollar cancer diagnostic developer. He stepped back as CEO in 2021 as the company was preparing to IPO. He has been contemplating the ways in which we can globalize the stock exchange through the blockchain since 2016, working to formulate the idea with Balaji Srinivasan who was a friend building a biotech company next door to Freenome at the time. The establishment of the first version of RWAs (mainly stablecoins) and their high market cap makes Gabriel believe that this is finally the time that a global RWA exchange will take off. His previous dealings with regulators has proven valuable navigating the difficult regulatory challenges of Dinari. Gabriel holds a BA in Computational Biology and Chemistry from Cornell University and attended University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine for graduate studies before withdrawing to start Freenome.</p>\n<p>Jake Timothy (CTO): Jake began his career at Northrop Grumman’s aerospace division, where he led the development of sophisticated data-driven systems. These systems were pivotal in enhancing operational coordination internally and for the warfighter, including significantly increasing production rates for fighter jets amounting to billions of dollars in orders. In the realm of cryptocurrency, Jake was an early adopter, trading Bitcoin in 2011. He re-entered the crypto space in 2017 creating advanced trading algorithms and developing smart contracts. His expertise in decentralized finance led to the creation of a smart contract-based equity protocol, laying the foundation for Dinari’s flagship product, the dShares tokenized stocks platform. Jake holds an MS in spacecraft navigation and control from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.</p>\n<p>Chas Rampenthal (CLO): From 2003 to 2021, Chas served LegalZoom in several roles. Initially, as General Counsel, he managed the Company’s legal functions, including corporate transactions, litigation, regulatory, intellectual property, government relations, employment, legal ethics, and compliance. During his last two years, Chas served as Segment Leader for the Attorney Asist Segment and as Head of Industry Relations. During his time at LegalZoom, Chas wrote a regular column for Inc. Magazine Online, and co-hosted Legally Bound – a live call-in Los Angeles talk radio program on KTLK and KABC. Chas is a member of the CA and MA bars. He earned his bachelor’s degree in economics and math studies summa cum laude from Southern Illinois University and his JD from the University of Southern California. Prior to his legal career, Chas served honorably in the United States Navy as an officer and naval aviator, where he flew multiple Outlaw Hunter combat missions in support of Operation Desert Storm.</p>\n<p>Brandon Ooi (CPO): Previously, Brandon was co-founder and CTO of Crunchyroll ($1B+ exit to Sony) an anime streaming and distribution company. He was instrumental in growing the company from the original 4 people to over 200 managing many aspects of engineering, product and infrastructure. He is a seasoned engineer with leadership roles at a number of startups including HOTorNOT (acquired by AM), Rune (CTO), Sharespace (CTO, acquired by Stripe) and SambaTV (Director of Engineering). With expertise spanning from consumer technology to enterprise fintech/compliance and experience at Stripe (3 years, platform/marketplace experience), he has always had a special interest in building real web3 financial products backed by real world assets. Brandon holds a degree from the UC Berkeley College of Engineering EECS program with a minor in Bioengineering.</p>\n<p>Garrett Wong (CFO): Garrett has held a number of finance leadership and investing roles, primarily in the technology industry. Previously, he was Chief Financial Officer at Teiko Bio. Prior, Garrett was at Shutterfly, where he led corporate development and investor relations and ran strategic finance for one of its business units. While at Shutterfly, Garrett led the company’s $225 million acquisition of Spoonflower and raised over $1 billion financing. Prior to Shutterfly, Garrett was a venture capital investor at Hewlett Packard Pathfinder, investing in and serving on the Boards of growth-stage tech startups.

Product Information</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Describe the product</p>\n<p>USFR.d is a Dinari issued token that is 1:1 backed by the WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund, USFR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Describe the underlying asset</p>\n<p>USFR - WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund<br>\nWisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund seeks to track the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Bond Index.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides cost-effective access to newly issued US government floating rate notes</li>\n<li>Designed to fluctuate with short-term rates and are priced at a spread over 3-mo Treasury Bills</li>\n<li>Short-term government bond solution that fluctuates with most recent 3-mo Treasury Bills</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</p>\n<p>Dividend yield is distributed as soon as it is available. Dinari does not hold back distributions or speculate on future yield. USFR.d yield is accrued from the underlying asset monthly and distributed as soon as it is available.</p>\n<p>Investors have a choice in how their yield is transferred. Yield is distributed by Dinari to USFR.d token holders in one of two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stablecoin distribution: Yield is transferred to the tokenholder by distributions of our USD+ stablecoin to the holding wallet. USD+ can be reinvested, redeemed for USDC, or held to accrue additional interest.</li>\n<li>Token accrual: If USFR.d is wrapped (USFR.dw), the yield will be automatically reinvested and accrued to the vault as additional USFR.d tokens which are reified upon unwrapping. This increases the exchange rate between USFR.d and USFR.dw such that the increase in exchange rate corresponds to the yield accrued.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: Wrapping from USFR.d to USFR.dw increases compatibility and composability with DeFi. Wrapped dShares are able to account for rebasing changes to the underlying stock such as stock splits/reverse splits and continue to provide yield even when staked or otherwise used in DeFi protocols. You are able to wrap and unwrap dShares at <a href=\"http://sbt.dinari.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sbt.dinari.com</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</p>\n<p>The issuer Dinari, Inc is incorporated in the United States.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</p>\n<p>Dinari offers dShares including USFR.d to countries outside the US and excluding regions identified in the unsupported countries list (<a href=\"https://docs.dinari.com/user-guide/unsupported-countries\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.dinari.com/user-guide/unsupported-countries</a>).<br>\nWe currently do not limit investment concentration.

This is primarily due to the slowness of moving fiat USD through the traditional finance system.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/5/55aff640ee2c5745d452253703053269bb0d76be.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ce1A3YOyyL6Q5Dc5X7f385IgdyK.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/5/55aff640ee2c5745d452253703053269bb0d76be_2_294x536.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ce1A3YOyyL6Q5Dc5X7f385IgdyK\" width=\"294\" height=\"536\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/5/55aff640ee2c5745d452253703053269bb0d76be_2_294x536.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/5/55aff640ee2c5745d452253703053269bb0d76be_2_441x804.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/5/55aff640ee2c5745d452253703053269bb0d76be_2_588x1072.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6FA\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency?

Dinari Vault Inc. will be an independent but wholly-owned subsidiary of Dinari Ltd. and protected from creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. Dinari Ltd. will operate a segregated account under Bermuda’s Segregated Accounts Companies Act (SAC Act) of 2000, with an independent segregated account representative as required by law. This is a high-priority feature and we expect completion in Q3 of 2024.</p>\n<p>Dinari issues over 40 different asset tokens representing a wide range of US securities from technology companies to commodities ETFs and beyond.

We have added custom logic to manage transfer restrictions of our tokens so we are able to fulfill our AML commitments and regulatory compliance, as well as control minting and burning permissions.</p>\n<p>The Dinari automated fulfillment system listens for new orders from the OrderProcessor smart contract. When a new order is created, the order is validated including checking that the user has passed KYC and AML checks. Then an order for the underlying asset, USFR, is placed with our brokerage. If the order for USFR is filled successfully, the order is filled and closed onchain. Final fees are specified and collected during order fill.</p>\n<p>The backend processes that monitor for orders and complete fulfillment store more detailed information on the state of the order. Dinari provides a REST API that makes order information available for enterprise users. The API is also useful for placing orders programmatically as it provides price quotes, fee quotes, and the token list.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</p>\n<p>We actively work with AllianceDAO who are investors in Dinari. We have also previously received grants from the Arbitrum Foundation and are in active discussions with several DAOs to be a yield-bearing provider for their treasury management.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</p>\n<p>Dinari can offer the SparkDAO/MakerDAO ecosystem a broad range of assets. For treasuries or users who would like exposure to higher levels of yield, we can bring fixed income funds onchain that target other types of bonds. We also provide exposure to commodity funds and index funds, enabling more diverse inflation protection strategies.</p>\n<p>As we launch leveraged trading and staking pools for USDC and other assets, we will offer attractive stablecoin yields fueled by traders borrowing against dShares. These pools may have a more attractive risk profile than other crypto staking pools since the assets are backed by stocks and other highly liquid assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</p>\n<p>USFR.d represents one of our most important asset classes and is the primary treasury component for USD+, Dinari’s yield-bearing stablecoin. It also acts as a “cash-sweep” investment for uninvested currency.</p>\n<p>Selected Dinari dShares are currently traded on the Camelot DEX on Arbitrum One.<br>\ndShares, including USFR.d, are also offered to end users through our distribution and aggregation partners. These partners integrate with our APIs and span a range of financial service providers including neobanks, payroll providers, and trading apps. Examples include Cadana, Offramp, and Kinto.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</p>\n<p>DAOs and their treasuries may be interested in diversifying their portfolio beyond T-bills products. We provide access to other fixed income products, REITS, commodity funds, index funds, and more.

We request the Governance Facilitators (<a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ee-gov-facilitator\">@EE-Gov-Facilitator</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/jansky\">@JanSky</a>) to please prepare a Governance Poll for this coming Monday to allow voters to review and approve the next-generation Atlas (”Atlas v2”).</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98719-atlas-v2-structure-whats-new-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98719-atlas-v2-structure-whats-new-1\"></a>Atlas v2 Structure: What’s New</h1>\n<p>The Atlas v2 reflects a significant structural change compared to v1. In the Atlas v1, there was the Atlas Immutable Alignment Artifact; and apart from that, there were five separate Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifacts for each of the Scopes. The Atlas v2 unifies into one artifact the immutable logic of the Atlas and the mutable logic of the five Scopes.</p>\n<p>In the new Atlas v2, documents are the basic units for structuring data. The five Atlas v1 Scopes are each represented in v2 as a set of Articles. Each Article, in turn, has a set of subdocuments, including Sections and Primary Documents. Atlas v2 introduces a new modular structure of Supporting Documents, which help clarify the logic of their Parent Documents.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98719-amending-the-atlas-v2-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98719-amending-the-atlas-v2-2\"></a>Amending the Atlas v2</h1>\n<p>We want to highlight some of the notable avenues for amending the Atlas v2. (This is not an exhaustive list, so we encourage you to hop over to the Atlas Portal, linked below!)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The new Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle</strong> provides a framework for amending the Atlas v2 via an Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal. This new Cycle is implemented via Governance Polls that run for three (3) days. An Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal can only proceed to a vote if it is triggered by a Prime Delegate whose buffer contains at least one month’s worth of budget.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Atlas Edit Monthly</strong> <strong>Cycle</strong> provides a monthly framework for amending the Atlas v2 via an Atlas Edit Proposal. It is implemented via Ratification Polls that run for two (2) weeks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Active Data Updates</strong> enable Facilitators and other ecosystem actors to directly update Atlas documents containing data that must be frequently modified as part of Sky Ecosystem’s routine operational tasks. These documents are called Active Data in Atlas v2. These Active Data Updates are implemented outside of the standard governance cycles. For instance, Active Data Updates enable Governance Facilitators to maintain, in real time, the list of current Aligned Delegates.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To ensure the stability and security of the Sky Ecosystem throughout the Launch transition, the Atlas v2 also has built-in flexibility to ensure any unintended outcomes can be quickly addressed. This is achieved, for instance, through the Facilitators’ Bootstrapping Poll and also the broad discretionary capacities granted to Facilitators. These elements help ensure that the Ecosystem can promptly adapt to emerging challenges.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98719-meet-the-atlas-v2-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98719-meet-the-atlas-v2-3\"></a>Meet the Atlas v2</h1>\n<p>To prepare the Sky community for this critical vote, we are making the Atlas v2 available in two forms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The official version of the Atlas v2 on Github at <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/next-gen-atlas\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - makerdao/next-gen-atlas</a></li>\n<li>A new Atlas Portal at <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The official version on our Github page is optimized for verifiability. It is a static HTML file that will not change during the review and voting period. This is enforced both by Github’s version control system as well as by Sky Governance, which has a <a href=\"https://maroon-peaceful-lemming-588.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreih7mbj4npqhxeprzk7sahpqjrajmxursaenzqgxdw5uo7sz554os4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">hash</a> of the originally uploaded HTML file. This is similar to the controls that exist around the MIP process.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Github, our friends at <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/powerhouse\">@Powerhouse</a> have built an Atlas Portal that makes it easier for community members to explore the contents of the new Atlas. The Atlas Portal has the advantage of allowing you to start at the highest level of the Scopes and drill down, toggle by toggle, into Sections, Primary Documents, and Supporting Documents to learn more about the content you are interested in.</p>\n<p><em>Please note</em>: there will be differences in the Document Identifiers between the official Github repository and the Atlas Portal. The Document IDs in the Github repo use Atlas Axis’ temporary, pared-down document numbering scheme, which allows us to quickly iterate during this early stage of Atlas development. The Doc IDs in the Atlas Portal are algorithmically generated and closer to the Atlas’ formal document identifier rules. The Atlas v2 content in the Github repo and the Portal is exactly the same.</p>\n<p>If you want to reference a particular Atlas Document, you can either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>go to the Atlas Github, perform a search for the provision and grab the permalink next to it; or,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>go to the Atlas Portal, perform a search in <code>Expand All</code> mode, and copy the url that appears when you hover to the left of the provision.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98719-navigating-the-portal-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98719-navigating-the-portal-4\"></a>Navigating the Portal</h2>\n<p>We recommend you start off by going to the top right-hand corner to <code>Collapse all</code> documents. This will show you the highest level structure of the Atlas v2.</p>\n<p>From there, you can delve into one Scope at a time, toggling deeper into the nested structure.<br>\nArticles that have a large number of Sections have been made more reader-friendly via the tool of <code>Categories</code>.

Where the Atlas v2 document does not have a <code>View Provenance</code> link, it is newly-developed logic.</p>\n<p>Our work in developing Atlas v2 has often been about taking currently operational processes not captured in v1 and codifying them into v2. We have been fortunate to work alongside a wide array of stakeholders who have been generous with their time and expertise, including protocol engineers, Facilitators, subject-matter experts and Aligned Delegates. For instance, we did valuable work in this vein around the Core Stability parameters, with the help of BA Labs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98719-specific-changes-from-atlas-v1-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98719-specific-changes-from-atlas-v1-6\"></a>Specific changes from Atlas v1</h1>\n<p>During the Atlas v2 development work, a number of provisions from Atlas v1 were amended, and some were removed. Generally, the impacted logic was either: 1) placeholder logic, 2) early-stage logic for future Sky developments; or 3) obsolete logic.</p>\n<p><strong>Placeholder logic</strong> includes those provisions in Atlas v1 that set out high-level concepts without corresponding details that would allow for operationalization by actors in the Sky Ecosystem. Particularly where those concepts did not relate to mission-critical or currently active functions in the Sky Ecosystem, we have chosen to streamline Atlas v2 to reflect the current state. Examples of placeholder logic that were deferred include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DAO Toolkit</li>\n<li>New Ecosystem-Agreements Infrastructure</li>\n<li>Budgets, Milestones &amp; Results Reporting Standardization</li>\n<li>Star-related provisions (Frontend Standards, Incubation Communication Channels, etc.)</li>\n<li>Facilitator Scope-Assignment Process</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Early-stage logic for future Sky developments</strong> includes Atlas v1 provisions relating to initiatives in the Sky Ecosystem that have not yet launched. We have largely opted to defer these provisions until after the Sky Launch period, at which point we will revisit them in collaboration with our stakeholders. By focusing Atlas v2 on elements and infrastructure that are currently operational, incubating initiatives can adapt to emerging opportunities without being constrained by Atlas logic that was codified too early. Examples of early-stage logic for future Sky developments that were deferred include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NewChain</li>\n<li>FacilitatorDAOs</li>\n<li>Core Artificial Intelligence System</li>\n<li>New Ecosystem-Actor Incubation Infrastructure</li>\n<li>Accessibility Communication Channels Chat Platform</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Obsolete logic</strong> includes provisions in Atlas v1 that relate to legacy, transitional or other logic that is no longer relevant for the Sky Ecosystem, particularly following the Launch. This category reflects deprecated concepts and structures, such as the Core Units and Special Purpose Fund framework. While the Atlas v1 oversaw a transitional period that required management of legacy provisions and budgets, these are no longer needed. (For instance, all Core Unit budgets have fully expired.) Accordingly, we have removed these provisions from the Atlas v2. Examples of obsolete logic that were deferred include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Core Unit MIPs</li>\n<li>Special Purpose Fund MIP</li>\n<li>Alignment Conserver Bootstrapping Focus</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>To the Sky Ecosystem community: we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the Atlas v2. Many exciting things to come.</p>\n<p>Thanks much to all of our collaborators, and here’s to a fruitful Launch! <img src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12\" title=\":rocket:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rocket:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n            <p><small>18 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010","pubDate":"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 17:36:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25010"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010.rss","#text":"Atlas v2 Upgrade - Poll Request"},"filter":false},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - moreliquid MMMEUR","dc:creator":"joe_moreliquid","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<h3><a name=\"p-98713-grand-prix-application-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98713-grand-prix-application-1\"></a>Grand Prix Application</h3>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98713-i-product-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98713-i-product-summary-2\"></a>I.
