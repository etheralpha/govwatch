The WTGXX token available via WisdomTree Connect is an ERC-20 compatible token on Ethereum. WisdomTree facilitates orders and dividend payments in WisdomTree Connect via fiat (USD) and USDC (via the Stablecoin Conversion Service*). For the purposes of this proposal, we assume Spark elects to use USDC and the Stablecoin Conversion Service and all references to process and flows reflect this election.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree is also in the process of establishing an offshore private fund, with a similar mandate of U.S. Treasury and government securities, available to non-U.S. qualified investors that is anticipated to be made available via WisdomTree Connect.</p>\n<p><small>* <em>Please note investors cannot directly purchase shares of the Fund via USDC but are processed via the Stablecoin Conversion Service that is an operational process facilitated by WisdomTree. All future references to the Stablecoin Conversion Service and operations are describing the client’s experience.</em></small></p>\n<p><strong>2.\tDescribe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX invests in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury and government securities. Such securities may include: U.S. Treasury Notes (both fixed and floating rate), U.S. T-Bills, U.S. Government Agency Notes, including Discount Notes, that are either fixed or floating rate and issued by government agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Bank System, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the Federal Farm Credit Bank. The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements collateralized fully by U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government Agency securities or cash. The Fund may also invest in other investment companies that are government money market funds to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).</p>\n<p>The Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in government securities and repurchase agreements that are collateralized by government securities.</p>\n<p>The securities purchased by the Fund are subject to the quality, diversification, and other requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the1940 Act, and other rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).</p>\n<p>Please see the Prospectus and SAI for additional information, including additional strategy information and risk factors.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s weighted average life is 48 days and weighted average maturity is 29 days with a 7-Day yield of 5.03% as of 9/18/24.

Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. The Fund’s yield may be affected by changes in interest rates and changes in credit ratings. Income and/or dividends are not guaranteed. Performance data for the most recent month-end is available at <a href=\"http://wisdomtree.com/investments\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">wisdomtree.com/investments</a>.</em></small></p><small>\n<p>7-Day Yield – The current yield reflects the current earnings of the Fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year. It is the Fund’s total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement. Absent such waivers or reimbursements, the returns would have been lower.</p>\n<p>Weighted Average Life (WAL) – For money market funds, this is the weighted average of the life of the securities held in a fund or portfolio and can be used as a measure of sensitivity to changes in liquidity and/or credit risk. Generally, the higher the value, the greater the sensitivity. WAL is based on the dollar-weighted average length of time until principal payments must be paid, taking into account any call options exercised by the issuer and any permissible maturity shortening features other than interest rate resets. For money market funds, the difference between WAM and WAL is that WAM takes into account interest rate resets and WAL does not.</p>\n<p>Weighted average maturity (WAM) – The weighted average maturity of the portfolio represents the market-weighted average of the maturities of the portfolio’s individual holdings. A money market fund in the United States must maintain a weighted average maturity of 60 days or fewer.</p>\n</small><p><small>Visit <a href=\"http://sec.gov\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sec.gov</a> to obtain the most recent 12 months of publicly available information filed by the Fund with the SEC on Form N-MFP.</small></p>\n<p><strong>3.\tHow is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX declares dividends of net investment income every U.S. trading day (each day the NYSE is open for trading) as of 4:00 pm ET and distributions are made monthly (first business day of the following month). WisdomTree facilitates orders and dividend payments in WisdomTree Connect via fiat (USD) and USDC, via the Stablecoin Conversion Service. For the purposes of this proposal, we assume   Spark elects to use USDC and the Stablecoin Conversion Service and all references to process reflects this flow. Accordingly, the value of the dividends is paid to   Spark’s wallet via USDC.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tWhat is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WTGXX and Its Service Providers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trust (issuer of WTGXX):</strong> WisdomTree Digital Trust - United States (Delaware)</li>\n<li><strong>Investment Adviser:</strong> WisdomTree Digital Management, Inc. - United States</li>\n<li><strong>Sub-Adviser:</strong> Voya Investment Management Co.

The Fund maintains a policy pursuant to Rule 2a-7 to which the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser must follow. Rule 2a-7 is the principal rule governing money market funds in the U.S. This rule covers a range of topics that seek to ensure the ability of WTGXX to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and meet redemption orders in a timely manner. These topics include maturity of investments, type and quality of investments, issuer diversification, disclosure of portfolio holdings, fund liquidity, determination of amortized cost-based and market-based NAVs, and stress testing. Stress testing includes periodically testing and reporting to the WisdomTree Digital Trust Board of Trustees, which oversees the Fund (“Fund Board”), the test results, assumptions, and related assessments of the Fund’s ability to withstand stressful economic and financial market conditions. Further, with respect to portfolio liquidity, WTGXX must hold securities that are sufficiently liquid to meet reasonably foreseeable shareholder redemptions in light of the Fund’s obligations under section 22(e) of the 1940 Act to timely process shareholder redemptions. Specifically, this means WTGXX must maintain 25% of total assets in Daily Liquid Assets, 50% of the total assets in Weekly Liquid Assets, and a 5% maximum limit for investment in “illiquid” securities at the time of acquisition (defined as any security that cannot be sold or disposed of within seven days at approximately the market value ascribed to it).</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tAre any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No, this is not permitted in the Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>7.\tProvide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc).

Once the investor completes the onboarding process, an onchain attestation, represented by a non-transferable soulbound NFT, is issued to the investor’s wallet and only those registered wallets can participate in transactions. WisdomTree issued soulbound NFTs cannot be transferred and can be revoked by WisdomTree in the event that client status or conditions change.  Shareholders can also peer-to-peer transfer WTGXX tokens to other onboarded shareholders with registered wallets as described above with the Transfer Agent maintaining the official record of share ownership. In this manner, WisdomTree prevents transactions between unknown persons or unknown blockchain wallets.</p>\n<p>Separately, the WisdomTree Connect Portal for Fund subscriptions and redemptions is permissioned via IP whitelisting, a process completed during onboarding.

If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, investors purchase and redeem shares of WTGXX via a primary market subscription or redemption by interacting directly with the WisdomTree Connect platform. API connectivity is also available via WisdomTree Connect for investors to access WTGXX.</p>\n<p>We are working on multiple solutions to further enhance the experience of clients entering and exiting positions of WTGXX. In the near term, we are developing one-way pricing for instant sales of WTGXX (with a daily capacity cap via WisdomTree) for USDC via the Stablecoin Conversion Service.</p>\n<p>We are exploring functionality to provide two-way pricing for instant liquidity on both purchases and sales. This functionality would allow investors to purchase and sell WTGXX instantly via USDC using the Stablecoin Conversion Service, without a daily capacity cap. We believe this functionality would provide investors with a strong user experience, and, while there are no guarantees of its timing or ultimate availability due to a need for existing regulations and/or required licenses to evolve, we will continue to work towards this functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>16.\tWith what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made?

We are working on primary market developments specifically related to WTGXX. Our development plans include dividend reinvestment optionality and expanding existing funding and conversion mechanisms. We are also developing functionality whereby share purchases and redemptions can be facilitated via a service that includes additional currencies, crypto native assets, and stablecoins. We are also working to increase operational efficiency by extending order cutoff times. In the future, we also plan to leverage an onchain conversion mechanism to seamlessly process transactions from USDS to USDC via the Stablecoin Conversion Service to facilitate fund subscriptions or redemptions. Finally, we are exploring other novel methods of interaction via decentralized application (“dApp”) to allow primary market order placement for purchases and sales via smart contracts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the instant liquidity developments for purchases and sales detailed above in question 15, we are focused on the development of secondary market functionality for our offerings with the goal of utilizing the full potential of blockchain technology. Research &amp; development efforts currently underway include integration of atomic swaps, contingent transactions, oracles, time locks, account abstraction, third party attestations for KYC / AML verification, and zero knowledge proofs. We are also leveraging our position and connectivity to the wider financial markets to deliver on our vision to bring more traditional financial services onchain, including market making, pricing, credit facilitation and advanced risk management.</p>\n<p>We are continuously evaluating and evolving our practices to further our mission to provide regulated financial products to the onchain community. We have been a pioneer in this space since launching our Digital Assets division in 2020, which today includes: (1) launched 13 digital funds that are all tokenized 1940 Act funds with strategies across fixed income, equities, and asset allocation models, (2) launched real world asset tokens including a gold token (serving as certificate of title to physical gold) and a stablecoin, and (3) built a proprietary tokenization platform and tech stack that integrates blockchain technology with traditional finance infrastructure. We are committed to this space as an organization and believe onchain finance is the next evolution of financial services.</p>\n<p><em>The features detailed above would also be subject to then-existing regulations, regulatory interpretations and/or regulatory license requirements with no guarantees of timing or ultimately availability.</em><br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>IV.

Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>The WisdomTree Digital Trust structure in place is to limit bankruptcy risks and protect shareholders under the 1940 Act. The Trust’s assets are held with an independent custodian, State Street, in a segregated account. In the case of a bankruptcy of WisdomTree or any of its providers, including the custodian, WisdomTree, Inc. and its affiliates would have no claim to the Trust’s assets and the Trust would not be part of the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree Digital Trust issues 13 digital funds, all governed under the 1940 Act and this structure.</p>\n<p>In addition, WisdomTree is proud of its robust compliance program. It is WisdomTree’s policy to comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. Each employee is responsible for adhering to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to accounting and auditing matters.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree maintains a rigorous culture of compliance. There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks the group faces through the corporate governance system.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree has developed a strong governance process, which covers the group-wide strategy, risk management process and regulatory compliance. In addition, external advisors inform WisdomTree of any changes to the regulatory environment to ensure we fulfill all regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX is a registered 1940 Act Fund that enables shareholders to manage balances onchain while receiving the investor protections and benefits of shareholder rights under applicable U.S. law, including the 1940 Act.

Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and distributions declared by the Fund Board with respect to the Fund, and in the net distributable assets of the Fund on liquidation.</p>\n<p>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which a shareholder vote is required consistent with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. These shareholder voting rights generally include election of, or changes in, the Fund Board under applicable circumstances and approval of advisory agreements, including increases in management fees, each as further described in and subject to the Fund’s governing documents, Prospectus or otherwise as prescribed in the 1940 Act, as applicable.</p>\n<p>The Ethereum token is a record of the investor’s Fund ownership. Under WisdomTree’s integrated recordkeeping system, the onchain record is aligned with book-entry records maintained by WisdomTree Transfers. WisdomTree Transfers maintains a master shareholder file for all primary market purchases, primary market sales, and peer-to-peer transfers of the token between eligible tokenholders.</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tAre there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against WisdomTree Digital Management, WisdomTree Digital Trust, WisdomTree Securities, or WisdomTree Transfers.

The principal responsibilities of the Audit Committee are the appointment, compensation and oversight of the Trust’s independent registered public accounting firm, including the resolution of disagreements regarding financial reporting between Trust management and such independent registered public accounting firm, among other responsibilities. Annually, the independent registered public accounting firm reviews with the Audit Committee its audit of the Fund’s financial statements.</p>\n<p>A smart contract audit has been conducted by Oxorio. Audit reports for the smart contract are available at <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/TOKEN-STANDARDS-FRAMEWORK/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standards</a> and <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/ERC20-REVOCABLE-COMPLIANCE-STANDARD-SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standard Annex</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tDescribe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p>WisdomTree’s tokenization platform is designed to facilitate onchain ownership and transferability while seamlessly integrating with established traditional frameworks in the asset management industry. This convergence encompasses asset custody, risk management, portfolio management, and regulatory compliance.</p>\n<p>The onchain component utilizes common token standards, modified to meet the specific requirements of this use case. Specifically, the Fund tokens are ERC-20 compatible with additional functionalities to enhance ownership control. These functionalities include the ability to pause the token, freeze individual addresses, claw back tokens, and implement transferability checks.</p>\n<p>The token represents ownership of the Fund shares; however, regulatory requirements necessitate maintaining offchain records. To ensure compliance without limiting token functionality, we have implemented a bespoke integrated record-keeping system that continuously monitors onchain ownership changes and maintains alignment with the offchain ledger.</p>\n<p>A novel feature of our platform is the transferability checks, ensuring that only eligible wallets can hold the tokens. Onchain identity attestation is achieved by implementing a soulbound NFT (ERC-721) linked to the known wallet. Whenever a transfer method is called, a compliance oracle performs a check to ensure the receiving address also holds this soulbound NFT. We believe that using this soulbound NFT enables us to develop more decentralized identity management solutions compared to traditional allow lists or whitelists.</p>\n<p>WisdomTree has developed our own code base based on opensource standards that utilizes a beacon proxy pattern for upgradability. This enables us to have the maximum flexibility to respond to both client needs and regulations. This is a deliberate decision to build and manage this ourselves in order to leverage the power and innovation of the DeFi ecosystem and apply those learnings to our products and solutions.</p>\n<p>The code base we have deployed is aimed to serve as a foundation for future enhancements, particularly as we seek increased integration into DeFi enabled workflows and we continue on our goal to migrate more operations onchain over time.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>We have had two rounds of audit on the existing code base as of August 31, 2024. Any future adjustments or changes to the code base will be audited prior to deployment. A smart contract audit has been conducted by Oxorio. Audit reports for the smart contract are available at <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/TOKEN-STANDARDS-FRAMEWORK/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standards</a> and <a href=\"https://dataspanapi.wisdomtree.com/pdr/documents/REGULATORY_MISC/WDM/US/EN-US/ERC20-REVOCABLE-COMPLIANCE-STANDARD-SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Token Standard Annex</a>.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tDescribe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs.</strong></p>\n<p>We have actively engaged with Sky, affiliated stakeholders, and other DAOs in efforts to fully understand the unique needs and objectives of the onchain community. To meet the ecosystem’s unique needs, we have built solutions that (1) unlock access to tokenized real-world-assets, (2) have the ability to facilitate stablecoin conversion (e.g., to USD) to serve as a form of payment, (3) facilitate non-custodial wallet transactions and (4) implement onchain identity attestation via soulbound NFTs.</p>\n<p>Leveraging our traditional finance and blockchain expertise, we have developed products and platforms that seek to seamlessly integrate between the TradFi and DeFi worlds while implementing WisdomTree’s robust and rigorous compliance framework. We are committed to delivering best-in-class service for our clients, including adapting, building, and evolving our products, solutions, platforms, and integration points. As the industry evolves, WisdomTree will continue to develop bespoke solutions to provide regulated financial products, which could potentially include solutions built to the specific needs of Sky and its affiliates.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tBeyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to WTGXX, we have developed a full suite of 13 tokenized funds covering equity, fixed income, and asset allocation models, in addition to tokenized gold and a stablecoin. By onboarding to our platform and subject to applicable onboarding requirements, Spark can potentially access current and future products as they become available and as we continue to innovate, which we believe will be the types of products and services of benefit to Spark. Our products provide increased optionality to Spark’s treasury management through enhanced diversification as well as additional yield opportunities. Together, these funds ensure investors have access and selection to the asset class, structure, and accessibility required by their own unique situation while being assured of a regulated, established asset manager issuing and managing the Funds. Our full suite of digital funds may be found here: <a href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/digital-funds\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/digital-funds</a>.</p>\n<p>We are also in the process of establishing an offshore private fund, with a similar mandate of U.S. Treasury and government securities, available to non-U.S. qualified investors, as stated earlier in our responses.</p>\n<p>We believe that by providing access to real world assets across multiple asset classes, focusing on increasing liquidity and efficiency in primary and secondary markets, and issuing products via a robust legal framework, we are building an onchain experience for more users to interact with the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tDoes the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>WTGXX is currently able to be minted on Ethereum and Stellar. We will be deploying on select other EVM compatible chains over time. We consistently monitor the ecosystem evolving and continue to develop new, innovative ways to provide access to our solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tDo you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the solutions and products detailed above, WisdomTree, through applicable global subsidiaries, has the ability to deliver customized asset allocation guidance and direct access to our research and expertise to meet Spark’s specific investment objectives. Our Global Research Team and Chief Investment Office focus on four areas: product development, investment research, model portfolio management across various asset classes (equities, fixed income, alternatives, crypto), and strategic asset allocation. We can design and actively manage investment strategies that align with Spark’s specific needs.</p>\n<p>Spark would gain access to WisdomTree’s senior advisors for insights and education. Our research is readily available through multiple platforms, allowing the Spark community to stay updated with expert-driven content on current market trends and strategies. A copy of our Model Portfolio Investment Committee Q3 2024 Quarterly Strategic Outlook was emailed to GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial.</p>\n<p>We can also offer a comprehensive review of Spark’s existing investments through personalized portfolio consultations, delivering forward-looking insights tailored to your objectives. Our team can analyze Spark’s portfolio to potentially uncover hidden risks and provide actionable considerations to potentially enhance long-term performance.</p>\n<p>Finally, we can provide Custom Model Portfolios, which are designed and managed specifically to meet Spark’s objectives with a tailored approach to portfolio management, ensuring it is optimized for Spark. Our extensive research, including white papers, market insights, and long-term strategies, will keep the community informed and empowered to make confident financial decisions.</p>\n<br>\n<p><small><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong><br>\n<strong>Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing.

Describe the product</h3>\n<p>The Frictionless Institutional Cash US Treasury Fund (fsISTUSTD) is a Luxembourg-based tokenized fund that offers investors exposure to the BlackRock Institutional Cash Series (ICS) US Treasury Fund. This underlying fund is a public debt constant net asset value (CNAV) short-term money market fund that aims to maintain a stable net asset value of 1.00 USD.</p>\n<p>The fund’s primary objective is to preserve principal and provide same-day liquidity to USD by maintaining a portfolio of high-quality, short-term government debt and repurchase agreements. It invests in US Treasury bills, notes, and other obligations guaranteed by the US Government, as well as repurchase agreements collateralized by these securities. This strategy ensures increased liquidity and aims to offer investors a stable and secure investment option.</p>\n<p>Structured as a floating rate note, the fsISTUSTD Fund is tokenized using ERC-20/ERC-3643 standards, allowing for permissioned trading on various blockchain networks including Avalanche, Ethereum, and Base.</p>\n<p>The fund offers daily dealing with a minimum investment of USD 1,000 and a minimum redemption of just USD 0.01. It provides daily distributions and monthly coupon redemptions, catering to investors seeking regular income. The fund is rated by major agencies including S&amp;P, Moody’s, and Fitch, reflecting its commitment to maintaining high standards of quality and stability.</p>\n<p>Managed by Frictionless Markets S.à.r.l and domiciled in Luxembourg, the fund operates under the Securitisation Law of 22 March 2004. It’s important to note that this fund is exclusively available to accredited (professional client) investors in compliance with MiFID II regulations.</p>\n<p>In summary, the Frictionless Institutional Cash US Treasury Fund represents an innovative blend of traditional money market fund stability with the advantages of blockchain technology, offering professional investors a unique option for managing cash holdings in the evolving digital financial landscape.</p>\n<p>At Frictionless, we can customise and white-label our Institutional Cash Funds for clients. Specifically for SparkDAO, we propose the optional creation of a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong> with the Ticker <strong>skyUST</strong>. This fund has a similar structure to our fsISTUSTD fund but with some enhancements to cater to the SparkDAO community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-2-describe-the-underlying-asset-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-2-describe-the-underlying-asset-19\"></a>2.

Yields from investments are accrued daily, including non-business days, ensuring continuous returns for investors. These daily yields are represented by transferable, permissioned ERC-3643 tokens, referred to as ‘Daily Distribution Tokens’. This tokenization of yield allows for greater flexibility and transparency in yield management.</p>\n<p>A key feature of these Daily Distribution Tokens is their conversion schedule. All Daily Distribution Tokens issued within a given month become convertible to fiat cash on the first business day of the following month. This means that regardless of when the yield was accrued during the month, all tokens for that period share the same maturity date. This standardisation simplifies accounting and provides a clear timeline for investors expecting cash conversions. Another innovative aspect of these Daily Distribution Tokens is their tradeability. Unlike traditional yield distributions that may be locked until a specific date, these tokens can be traded 24/7. This feature provides investors with enhanced liquidity and the ability to manage their yield positions more dynamically, potentially opening up new strategies for cash management and short-term investing.</p>\n<p>Please see our daily attestation and reporting on token distributions at:</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://frictionless.markets/transparency\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://frictionless.markets/hubfs/frictionless-icon-black-2.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://frictionless.markets/transparency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">frictionless.markets</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    \n\n<h3><a href=\"https://frictionless.markets/transparency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Transparency, Stability, and Trust</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Always secure, always transparently &amp; independently attested</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the underlying asset will be the same and the skyUST will have its own independent daily reports of the same calibre as fsISTUSTD.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-4-what-is-the-jurisdiction-of-the-issuer-and-key-entities-32\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-4-what-is-the-jurisdiction-of-the-issuer-and-key-entities-32\"></a>4.

Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</h3>\n<p>The fsISTUSDT Fund (‘the Fund’) does permit the use of hedging and derivatives in its underlying portfolio, but this is managed within a strict risk management framework. The Portfolio Manager employs a comprehensive risk management process to monitor and measure the risk associated with all open derivative positions and their impact on the overall risk profile of the Fund’s portfolio.</p>\n<p>This process is designed to be continuous, allowing for real-time monitoring of the Fund’s exposure. The Portfolio Manager specifically uses a methodology known as the Commitment Approach to measure and manage the global exposure from Financial Derivative Instruments (FDIs). This approach aggregates the underlying market or notional values of FDIs to determine the degree of global exposure of the Fund to these instruments. Importantly, there are regulatory limits in place to control the use of these instruments. In accordance with the requirements of the Central Bank of Ireland, even if a Fund uses leverage through FDIs, the global exposure for such a Fund must not exceed 100% of that Fund’s Net Asset Value. This ensures that the use of derivatives and hedging strategies does not lead to excessive risk-taking. The Portfolio Manager maintains the flexibility to employ new techniques and instruments as they become available, subject to regulatory approval and proper risk management protocols. This approach allows the Fund to potentially benefit from financial innovations while maintaining a strong focus on risk control.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that while these tools are permitted, their use is closely monitored and controlled to ensure alignment with the Fund’s investment objectives and risk profile. The ultimate goal is to use these instruments, when appropriate, to enhance the Fund’s ability to meet its objectives while carefully managing associated risks.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the risk mitigation framework and Committed Approach, oversight and regulatory criteria will apply as it has done for the fsISTUSTD fund.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-7-provide-a-list-of-all-counterparties-and-service-providers-used-by-your-product-ie-custodians-trustees-reporting-agents-exchange-agents-banks-etc-provide-flow-charts-or-diagrams-for-all-related-entities-and-counterparties-if-available-37\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-7-provide-a-list-of-all-counterparties-and-service-providers-used-by-your-product-ie-custodians-trustees-reporting-agents-exchange-agents-banks-etc-provide-flow-charts-or-diagrams-for-all-related-entities-and-counterparties-if-available-37\"></a>7.

How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</h3>\n<p>The fsISTUSTD Fund (‘the Fund’) establishes bankruptcy remoteness for its assets through several mechanisms provided by the Luxembourg Securitisation Law. This legal framework effectively separates the securitised assets, including those in digital format, from any insolvency risks of the securitisation vehicle, the Issuer, service providers, and all other parties involved in the transaction.</p>\n<p>In the event of bankruptcy of the originator or the servicer responsible for collecting cash flows from the assets (including digital assets and digital securities), the Luxembourg Securitisation Law ensures that the securitisation vehicle can claim ownership transfer of the securitised assets and any cash collected on its behalf before liquidation proceedings begin. This provision safeguards the Fund’s assets from being included in the bankruptcy estate of these entities.</p>\n<p>The Securitisation Law further strengthens the Fund’s bankruptcy remoteness through three key provisions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Subordination Provision: This allows investors and creditors to subordinate their payment rights to other creditors or investors, which is crucial for structuring the securitisation transaction.</li>\n<li>Non-recourse Provision: Investors and creditors may waive their rights to request enforcement. For instance, if an interest payment defaults, investors can agree to defer payment without initiating legal action, accommodating known or temporary situations.</li>\n<li>Non-petition Provision: This allows investors and creditors to waive their rights to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against the securitisation vehicle, protecting it from individual investors who might have an interest in such proceedings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Regarding multiple products, the issuer, FRICTIONLESS MARKETS SECURITIES Securitisation Fund, utilises a compartment structure. The fsISTUSTD Fund operates within its own bankruptcy-remote and orphan-entity-protected compartment. This structure allows the issuer to have multiple products, each in its own compartment, without risking cross-contamination of assets or liabilities between different products.<br>\nDetailed legal opinions and supplementary documents regarding the structure of the Fund, are provided in the supplement. These documents offer a comprehensive legal analysis of the Fund’s structure and its compliance with the relevant provisions of the Luxembourg Securitisation Law, Financial Collateral Act and MiCA.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the same regulatory posture will exist.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-5-what-rights-do-token-holders-have-64\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-5-what-rights-do-token-holders-have-64\"></a>5. What rights do token holders have?</h3>\n<p>Tokenholders of the Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds enjoy a comprehensive set of rights and protections, underpinned by robust Luxembourg and European Union legislation. These rights are designed to ensure that tokenholders have equivalent protections to traditional securities holders, while also benefiting from the advantages of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>The rights of token holders are protected under several key pieces of Luxembourg legislation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Luxembourg Securitization Law of 2004 (as amended)</li>\n<li>The Financial Collateral Act 2005 (as amended)</li>\n<li>The Blockchain Acts I, II, and III (as amended)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These laws collectively ensure that tokenholders have the same legal and economic rights as traditional investors in orphan entities, and bankruptcy-remote securitization compartments. This means that token holders can expect:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clear ownership rights of their tokens, legally recognized and protected.</li>\n<li>The right to receive any distributions or interest payments associated with their tokens.</li>\n<li>The ability to transfer their tokens, with such transfers recognized as valid and binding.</li>\n<li>Protection of their assets from potential bankruptcy of the fund issuer or service providers.</li>\n<li>Equal treatment among all token holders of the same class.</li>\n<li>The right to access relevant information about their investment.</li>\n<li>Legal recourse through the Luxembourg legal system if their rights are violated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s important to note that the Luxembourg Securitisation Law of 2004 was recently amended, with changes coming into force in March 2022. These amendments were specifically designed to provide enhanced investor protection, further strengthening the rights of tokenholders.</p>\n<p>By leveraging Luxembourg’s position as the world’s dominant securitization location, tokenholders benefit from the legal protections of both Luxembourg and the broader European Union. This dual layer of protection provides a robust framework for safeguarding investor interests in the evolving landscape of blockchain-based financial instruments.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Should the community vote to accept our offer of launching a bespoke <strong>SKY US Treasury Fund</strong>, the same protections are provided.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-6-are-there-any-pending-or-threatened-legal-proceedings-or-investigations-against-the-company-or-any-of-its-officers-65\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-6-are-there-any-pending-or-threatened-legal-proceedings-or-investigations-against-the-company-or-any-of-its-officers-65\"></a>6.

In general, there are several advantages to utilising this structure considering the scale of investment the Spark DAO community can leverage in Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds.</em></p>\n<p>A Luxembourg SOPARFI (Société de Participations Financières) is a holding and financing company that offers several key advantages, especially for investors looking to optimise tax efficiency, financial structuring, and operational flexibility, such as:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-tax-efficiency-68\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-tax-efficiency-68\"></a>Tax Efficiency</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Participation Exemption: SOPARFIs can benefit from the participation exemption regime, which allows for tax exemptions on dividends received and capital gains from qualifying holdings. This can significantly reduce or eliminate taxes on income generated from investments in subsidiaries.</li>\n<li>Interest Deduction: Interest payments made by a SOPARFI can generally be deducted from its taxable income, lowering its effective tax rate.</li>\n<li>No Withholding Tax on Liquidation Proceeds: Distributions made during the liquidation of a SOPARFI are generally free from withholding tax, making it an attractive structure for exit planning.</li>\n<li>Favourable Double Tax Treaties: Luxembourg has an extensive network of double tax treaties that can reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and royalties paid to or by a SOPARFI in cross-border transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-flexible-corporate-structure-69\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-flexible-corporate-structure-69\"></a>Flexible Corporate Structure</h4>\n<p>Although primarily used as a holding company, a SOPARFI can engage in various financial activities, including holding shares, granting loans, financing activities, managing intellectual property rights, and even real estate investments.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-no-specific-regulatory-supervision-70\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-no-specific-regulatory-supervision-70\"></a>No Specific Regulatory Supervision</h4>\n<p>A SOPARFI is not considered a regulated entity like an investment fund or financial institution, meaning it is not subject to the direct supervision of Luxembourg’s financial regulator, the CSSF (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier). This makes the setup and ongoing operation simpler and less costly in terms of regulatory compliance.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-efficient-holding-structure-71\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-efficient-holding-structure-71\"></a>Efficient Holding Structure</h4>\n<p>SOPARFIs are ideal for international holding structures, enabling investors to manage and consolidate their global investments under one umbrella. They can hold interests in both EU and non-EU companies, providing flexibility for cross-border operations.</p>\n<p>Luxembourg’s stable and business-friendly environment ensures legal certainty and an attractive framework for managing complex financial structures.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-attractive-capital-gains-treatment-72\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-attractive-capital-gains-treatment-72\"></a>Attractive Capital Gains Treatment</h4>\n<p>In addition to the participation exemption on capital gains, Luxembourg also offers favourable conditions for individuals holding shares in a SOPARFI, with low capital gains tax rates for residents under certain conditions.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-vat-exemptions-73\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-vat-exemptions-73\"></a>VAT Exemptions</h4>\n<p>A SOPARFI can benefit from VAT exemptions on financial services it provides, such as granting loans or managing subsidiaries, which further enhances its cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-confidentiality-and-investor-protection-74\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-confidentiality-and-investor-protection-74\"></a>Confidentiality and Investor Protection</h4>\n<p>Luxembourg provides strong investor protection laws and respects confidentiality regarding financial matters, ensuring that investors’ privacy is maintained while enjoying the benefits of this corporate structure.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-99065-attractive-exit-opportunities-75\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-attractive-exit-opportunities-75\"></a>Attractive Exit Opportunities</h4>\n<p>Given the participation exemption and the favourable tax treatment of liquidation proceeds, SOPARFIs offer attractive conditions for investors looking to exit their holdings through liquidation, M&amp;A transactions, or divestitures.</p>\n<p>In summary, by utilising a Luxembourg SOPARFI, Spark DAO can benefit from a combination of tax efficiency, flexibility, and international legal frameworks, for holding and financing activities into any tokenized asset class or fund issued by Frictionless Markets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99065-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-76\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-76\"></a>V.

Furthermore, this is extended to the deposit tokens in any currency denomination, therefore the Spark community can exercise global protection of their assets under these collateralization laws.</p>\n<p>As our Frictionless Institutional Cash Funds are exclusively invested in the BlackRock Institutional Cash Series there is no cash drag in the funds, once the order is fulfilled and accepted by the transfer agent on business days, the cash is put to work instantly, returning the daily distributions on the following business day. This maximises the capital efficiency of the Spark DAO and Sky community.</p>\n<p>As the issuer of multiple public constant NAV funds with multiple currencies at both spot and fwd FX, our solution can ensure that the Spark DAO community can react quickly to changing interest rate environments on the horizon, by deploying Dollar/USDC/USDS into potentially higher returning funds such as the Sterling Gov Liquidity fund.</p>\n<p>Finally, our globally recognised structure and issuance ensure that the Spark DAO community and Sky Money can attract investors without worrying about opaque tax structures, FATCA, CRS, and other key international agreements and regulations.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-99065-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-93\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99065-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-93\"></a>3.

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of OPI and was incorporated under the laws of Switzerland on 26 April 2023 by way of a notarial deed.</p>\n<p>According to the articles of association of Matterhorn, its established purpose is to acquire, hold, and administer majority and minority participation in companies in the DeFi industry and tokens.

OPI’s legal and compliance team, which has extensive experience in dealing with both traditional and crypto-assets, will be an invaluable resource. Matterhorn will work closely with the legal team to ensure that the tokenization of RWAs complies with regulatory standards. They will also structure the tokens in a way that adheres to the legal frameworks of various jurisdictions, thereby safeguarding both Matterhorn and the MakerDAO community from potential legal pitfalls.</p>\n<p>Any gain realized between the redemption proceeds and the original purchase amount is subject to taxation at the investor’s applicable tax rate.</p>\n<p>MUSF does not distribute dividends or make other distributions, so the primary tax consequence arises from the gain or loss realized on redemption. No taxes are withheld on any transactions within the Fund.</p>\n<p>The Fund Admin will prepare a Schedule K-1 annually for each investor, detailing their share of the Fund’s gains or losses for the year.

The tokenization platform is built on modular architecture and supports all tokenization features through UI and APIs.  The platform will mint Digital Asset Securities based on real-time valuation using ERC-3643 and ERC-1404 security token standards. We have created our own standard regulatory and compliant ERC token.</p>\n<p>Our platform supports the minting of tokens on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Base, Solana, Provenance, and Aptos blockchains along with private blockchains like R3 Corda, and Canton. All blockchains are built on the same standard. Offers the ability to easily add support for more tokenization standards and blockchains.</p>\n<p>The tokens are designed with the following advanced features: on-chain compliance, upgradeability, a factory pattern for efficient deployment, multi-signature (multisig) support, and account abstraction. They also incorporate custom asset control contracts, capital call and distribution functionalities, and waterfall mechanisms. Additionally, the tokens have the capability to mint, burn, freeze, and forcibly transfer assets.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our smart contracts integrate with a custom oracle to retrieve real-time pricing data, enabling on-chain calculations and decision-making.

Product Summary</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Project name:</strong><br>\nRealize</p>\n<p><strong>2. Product name:</strong><br>\nRealize T-BILLS Fund (the “Fund”)</p>\n<p><strong>3. Product type / underlying asset:</strong><br>\nThe Fund is the first Abu Dhabi Global Market (“ADGM”) tokenized open-ended investment fund based out of Abu Dhabi, UAE. The principal purpose and investment objective is to invest into and tokenize Exchange-Traded Funds that hold short-term U.S treasury bills and short-term U.S. treasury bills directly. The tokenized asset, $RBILL, will be available to investors on Ethereum and other major Blockchains.</p>\n<p>The Fund is the first tokenized fund to be authorized by the regulator in ADGM, a historical achievement made possible through the close alignment and collaboration between Realize, its partners and the regulator. Based on English common law, ADGM is one of the most exciting jurisdictions for traditional finance and especially for the digital assets space, as ADGM has created the necessary legal and regulatory framework for asset issuers, investment managers and investors to operate with clarity, safety and certainty.</p>\n<p>The Fund is also one of the first directly tokenized funds globally, where the actual units in the fund are tokenized. This gives investors into the $RBILL fund direct ownership rights, legal and regulatory protection, and better oversight of fund operations. This is in contrast to many competing structures which have opaque, expensive, complex and convoluted structures using third-party custodians, pledging agreements and SPVs. In many cases, the structures are unregulated and therefore their products carry potential risk of closure in the future as regulations tighten. Competitor products use a Custodian as the participating shareholder which means the structure falls outside of the parameters of securities and fund rules in the relevant domicile of the fund. This means there is no oversight by the relevant regulator, and provides little to no protection to investors into those products.</p>\n<p>The $RBILL token represents a direct, tokenized ownership right in the ADGM-authorized Realize T-BILLS Fund. This positions $RBILL as one of the safest and cheapest ways to hold tokenized treasury bills on-chain.</p>\n<p>Realize is not just a tokenization platform to tokenize regulated funds and bring yield-bearing assets on-chain, but is positioning itself to become an RWA ecosystem. The main focus of Realize is the utility and collateralization of tokenized assets. Our ecosystem team is already forming strategic partnerships with major DeFi dApps to open up entire new possibilities of tokenized assets within Web3.</p>\n<p>Key highlights of the Fund and the underlying asset:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. Treasury Bills with short-term maturities of 3 months or less</li>\n<li>The Fund partakes in direct tokenization, reducing the need for complicated engagements and opaque ownership structures</li>\n<li>The Fund is significantly more economical viable for investors:\n<ul>\n<li>0% management fee</li>\n<li>0% performance fee</li>\n<li>0% tokenization fee, with an option to charge 10 bps post $100 million AUM</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Instant 24/7 liquidity for USDC and other cryptocurrencies through liquidity partnerships, T+1 for wire transfers</li>\n<li>Subscriptions and redemptions in all major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins (including $USDS and $SKY)</li>\n<li>The Fund is operated by seasoned fund administrators and investment managers</li>\n<li>The team behind Realize is crypto native with extensive experience in building and deploying DeFi protocols and building Web3 ecosystems</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4.

Company Details</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Company description:</strong></p>\n<p>Realize is a tokenization platform that focuses on unlocking the full potential of real-world assets in Web3. Based in Abu Dhabi, Realize leverages strategic regional connections, clear regulatory framework and institutional partnerships to provide a seamless solution for tokenizing assets. Together with our partners, Realize is merging the worlds of traditional finance and decentralized finance out of one of the most exciting, safe and crypto-friendly jurisdictions. We are bringing the future of tokenization from the UAE to the world.</p>\n<p>Realize is the fund sponsor of the Realize T-BILL Fund (OEIC), the first tokenized fund to be authorized by Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), one of the leading finance ecosystems in the world.</p>\n<p>Together with Neovision Wealth Management Limited (the “Fund Manager” or “Neovision”), Realize and Neovision have created a scalable and robust framework to tokenize regulated funds. We are currently working towards tokenizing several additional funds to be operational and accessible fully on-chain, including trade finance funds, UAE real estate, government-backed bonds and other ETFs. With this platform, Realize is positioned to bring safe, yield-bearing assets on-chain and offer new opportunities for crypto native treasury managers, DAOs and HNWIs to diversify and manage their portfolio entirely on-chain.</p>\n<p>Unlike many current tokenization efforts, Realize operates within a framework designed for broadening accessibility, liquidity and utility of tokenized assets. Most companies in the tokenization space focus on building closed ecosystems that they can control, charging high fees for limited services and restricting liquidity. These systems frequently stifle innovation, asset composability and limit the flexibility and opportunities that tokenization can offer.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Realize is committed to maximizing composability, liquidity, transparency, and security in the tokenization space. We are expanding the utility of tokenized assets across the Web3 ecosystem, providing deep integrations and partnerships with major L1 and L2 blockchains. The Realize platform empowers investors to tokenize their assets and access a wide array of applications, including asset collateralization, unlocking yield opportunities beyond the limits of traditional finance. By breaking down the barriers of closed ecosystems, Realize fosters an open, interconnected environment where investors can fully unlock the value of their tokenized assets, diversifying and managing their capital with new investment opportunities.</p>\n<p>Our mission is to democratize access to real-world assets by seamlessly integrating them within Web3. We strive to offer a secure, efficient, and transparent gateway for investors to gain exposure to a diverse range of assets, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and yield opportunities that are traditionally unavailable in conventional finance.</p>\n<p>Watch this short video to learn more about Realize:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eLatmPge88A?feature=shared\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/8/7801aa12908d077db9be4defc6ab8fd97fe397cd.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"h7CRsFOQFYTv6nPBIWyjpMOAMON\" width=\"690\" height=\"359\" role=\"presentation\"></a><br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2.

Product Information</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.1 Realize T-BILLS Fund (OEIC) Limited</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is the first tokenized fund to be authorised by the regulator in the UAE (ADGM) and is managed by Neovision (see section 4 for more information pertaining to key counterparties).</p>\n<p>The Fund is an open-ended investment fund allowing investors to gain access to U.S. government bonds as digital tokens on the blockchain. Each RBILL token represents a claim on underlying T-Bills, with rights and obligations managed by smart contracts. These tokenized T-Bills, with one-year maturity or less, are backed by shares in underlying U.S. Treasuries ETFs. Available initially on both Ethereum, IOTA and other major L1 / L2 Blockchains, RBILL tokens can be exchanged for stablecoin or FIAT currency, with a minimum investment of $50,000.</p>\n<p>This approach eliminates the traditional barriers faced by non-U.S. investors, offering a seamless and global investment opportunity. The combination of low-risk T-Bills and the transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology makes $RBILL a compelling option for diverse investor profiles. $RBILL provides real-time accountability and 24/7 subscriptions and redemptions, ensuring flexibility and convenience for investors.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>1.2. Key innovations of the Fund</strong></p>\n<p>Authorized structure in major crypto-friendly jurisdiction:</p>\n<p>Abu Dhabi is widely recognized as the top FinTech hub in the MENA region, with ADGM playing a pivotal role in championing the development of a sustainable and vibrant FinTech ecosystem. ADGM has set numerous “firsts” in the region, including the first FinTech regulatory regime and the first FinTech RegLab, which is now the second most active FinTech sandbox globally, after London.</p>\n<p>ADGM’s commitment to technological innovation within financial services aligns with its mission to support growth in FinTech while promoting systemic safety and consumer protection. Positioned strategically between European and Asian markets, Abu Dhabi serves as a global crossroads, where ADGM’s partnerships with regulators and private sector entities foster a thriving FinTech ecosystem.</p>\n<p>By being domiciled in ADGM, the Fund is being supervised by one of the most progressive, advanced and protective legal jurisdictions. ADGM is based on UK common law, making it a perfect domicile for the Fund:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clear and transparent regulation</li>\n<li>Best-in-class investor protection</li>\n<li>Strict supervision and compliance of the fund operations</li>\n<li>Thriving ecosystem with many of the largest financial institutions having set up their operations to ADGM in recent years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Direct tokenization of fund shares:</p>\n<p>Direct tokenisation is where the securities of the fund are directly tokenized, ie, instead of an issuance of participating shares in a fund, the fund issues security tokens which would then be traded on a platform. The Fund is managed by the Fund Manager in the same manner a traditional fund would.</p>\n<p>Some of the key benefits of this structure are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduction of complexity</li>\n<li>Less operational risks</li>\n<li>Increased investor protection</li>\n<li>Faster and easier issuance and redemption</li>\n<li>Real-time settlement on blockchain</li>\n<li>Counterparty risk reduced against a regulated investment fund</li>\n<li>Direct claim on assets in the fund, rather than in synthetic indirect tokenization structures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike competing solutions, the Realize T-BILLS Fund provides investors a directly tokenized fund structure, a rarity in the market. We believe this model represents a best-in-class approach for tokenizing funds, setting a new standard for fund tokenization within ADGM and globally.</p>\n<p>In stark contrast, indirect tokenization involves the fund operating as a more traditional vehicle, issuing participating shares as part of an investment round. These shares are typically subscribed to by a single entity (often offshore), referred to as the Custodian. The Custodian then issues tokens that provide contractual rights to the underlying assets it holds, with investors receiving tokens representing their interests in the ‘Fund.’ However, since the Custodian remains the participating shareholder, the tokenization may fall outside the scope of securities and fund regulations in the fund’s jurisdiction. This results in reduced oversight, higher operational costs, and the introduction of unknown risks for investors.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/i23tE3nkeJwDeLd0pzzUu0bHdwu.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_690x271.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"i23tE3nkeJwDeLd0pzzUu0bHdwu\" width=\"690\" height=\"271\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_690x271.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_1035x406.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/e/7e62a1a60b2aff6352152356f9b80677743e0fea_2_1380x542.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0E1DF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>0% Management fees and 0% Performance fees:</p>\n<p>Due to its pioneering direct tokenization model, the operational costs of the Fund are significantly lower compared to competing structures.

We address the following issues:<p></p>\n<p>Isolated assets: Many tokenized assets exist in isolation, lacking Web3 compatibility and preventing them from being effectively integrated into DeFi ecosystems. We bridge this gap, enabling true interoperability and usability of tokenized assets across various dApps.</p>\n<p>Misaligned audience: Realize is addressing the growing demand in the Middle East for innovative financial solutions by focusing on real-world asset tokenization. With our launch in this region, we are positioned to meet the needs of sophisticated investors seeking reliable, compliant opportunities that align with the Middle East’s forward-looking financial landscape.</p>\n<p>Opaque fund structures: Many tokenization platforms rely on unregulated offshore structures, creating opacity around the funds and raising compliance concerns. Realize operates within a regulated framework, including the first direct tokenized fund structure launched under ADGM, providing clarity and security to investors.</p>\n<p>Indirect funds: Ineffective tokenization processes result in indirect fund structures, limiting the benefits of blockchain technology. We offer a direct tokenization model, unlocking greater liquidity, transparency, and yield-generating opportunities for investors.</p>\n<p>Extra fees: Many tokenization platforms charge [high] fees for the process itself, reducing overall returns. Realize offers a more cost-effective, transparent solution, ensuring that investors can maximize the value of their tokenized assets without unnecessary overhead.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>1.4. Legal framework for the tokenization of the Fund</strong></p>\n<p>In order to tokenize the Fund, the Fund will conduct an “Initial Token Offering” (an “ITO”) and offer tokens (the “Tokens”). The ITO will be a direct tokenization of an ADGM fund: The regulation permits fund-raising using DLT with the tokens representing a “traditional” regulated issuance, such as Shares, Debentures or Units in a Collective Investment Fund. In these instances, a DLT platform may also comprise a share or bond register. The issuance of the Tokens is akin to the issuance of “Units” in the Fund and will constitute Digital Securities. Accordingly, each holder of a Token could be considered a “Unitholder”. There is no express legislation or rules in ADGM as to process or requirements for an ITO. In order to try and adopt best-in-class principles and ensure transparency and compliance with ADGM laws and rules, the ITO will be undertaken on the same basis as an offering of Units in the Fund, together with customary elements that would form part of a “White Paper” used in token offerings, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detailed information about the token: The economic and legal features and characteristics of the Token which make it an FSRA regulated ‘security’. This includes the nature of the securities and the rights and liabilities attaching to those securities.</li>\n<li>Information about the token sale: This includes the timeline of the ITO, the price of the Tokens, and the method of purchase.</li>\n<li>Information about the project team: This includes the backgrounds and qualifications of the team members.</li>\n<li>Legal and regulatory information: This includes any legal and regulatory considerations, such as how the token is classified under ADGM laws and rules.</li>\n<li>DLT: An explanation of the use of the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) behind the tokenization of the Tokens and the overall execution of the ITO on the DLT platform.</li>\n<li>A copy of the White Paper will be made available separately upon request.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund Manager is initially targeting the following ETFs which offer efficient and liquid subscriptions and redemptions:</p>\n<p>SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issuer: State Street</li>\n<li>Inception Date: 05/25/07</li>\n<li>Expense Ratio: 0.14%</li>\n<li>AUM: $34.79B</li>\n<li>Index Tracked Bloomberg US Treasury - Bills (1-3 M)</li>\n<li>Segment ICE BofA US Treasury (9-12 M)</li>\n<li>Structure Open-Ended Fund</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issuer: BlackRock, Inc.</li>\n<li>Inception Date: 05/26/20</li>\n<li>Expense Ratio: 0.09%</li>\n<li>AUM: $25.67B</li>\n<li>Index Tracked ICE 0-3 Month US Treasury Securities Index</li>\n<li>Segment ICE BofA US Treasury (9-12 M)</li>\n<li>Structure Open-Ended Fund<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3.

We are in discussions with our regulator to find ways to ensure RBILL can be more interoperable in DeFi and to allow for secondary transfers. We are looking to build and support an RWA ecosystem in which RWAs can be utilized within DeFi. This will include partnerships with, or launching of our own, DeFi RWA-focused applications; management of RWA tokens on behalf of investors; and creation of RWA DeFi strategies.</p>\n<p>B. Outside of RBILL, Realize is an RWA tokenization platform which is capable of supporting additional RWA tokens. Realize currently has plans to launch two additional tokenized funds, and is in talks with several key players (both local to UAE and abroad) to tokenize further assets.</p>\n<p>At Realize, we see the tokenization of RWAs as the first step towards building a truly global, immersive, free and fair economy. In order to realize this vision, tokenized RWAs must have additional utility along with the ability to be traded on secondary markets.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>IV. Legal Structure</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market) in Abu Dhabi, UAE.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Realize T-BILLS Fund (OEIC) Ltd has been incorporated under registration 20534 and authorized as a fund by ADGM under referent F-0126, a copy of the authorisation letter can be shared privately.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund has been created with the sole purpose to support the launch of the RBILL token in a regulated and transparent manner. The Fund will not issue any separate or additional products to its investors.</p>\n<p>The Fund is managed by NeoVision, a licensed investment manager headquartered in UAE. Ascent Fund Services Limited is the regulated Administrator who will calculate the daily NAV and perform daily subscriptions and redemptions.</p>\n<p>Following the RBILL minting process, investors’ tokens are provided directly to the investor and are not retained by Realize, the Fund or any of its affiliates, unless the investor chooses to use a full custody service provider (partnerships to be announced shortly).</p>\n<p>Shares in US Treasury ETFs are acquired and custodied through our broker, Interactive Brokers LLC. Additional regulated brokers and custodians of the ETFs will be added in the future. Realize does not hold or retain any rights to the Fund’s assets and the Fund’s assets are not recognised on Realize’s or the Fund Manager’s balance sheet. Furthermore, no operational capital of Realize or its affiliates are commingled with the Fund’s assets (digital or otherwise). Assets are also not leveraged or managed within an investment strategy which ensures the assets are not at risk.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, the Fund is subject to an annual external audit, provided by Grant Thornton. This ensures that the management and administration of the Fund is in line with its legal and regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p>We are working with Chainlink and the Fund Administrator to implement off-chain proof of reserves and are exploring implementing a transparency council which would include a number of trusted partners who would have view access of the asset accounts for the Fund. We would be happy to add members of SparkDAO / MakerDAO to this council.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>The rights of token holders are entrenched in the Articles of Association of the Fund, of which a contractual nexus exists between the Fund and the token holders. Any subsequent transferee of a token, or a fraction of a token, will sign customary documents adhering to the various Fund documents binding it to the obligations thereunder and affording it their rights therein. In summary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The tokens afford the token holder a proportionate share in the assets of the Fund (in the same manner as participating shares would afford the holder a right in the assets of the fund in a traditional structure).</li>\n<li>The tokens may be subscribed for (minted) and redeemed (burned) in accordance with the Fund documents.</li>\n<li>Subscribers sign a token purchase agreement that will reflect substantially the form of a fund subscription agreement as well as containing all other information necessary in connection with the issuing of the investor’s tokens.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>Realize and its officers have maintained a clean legal record, with no history of criminal or legal enforcement actions.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO:</strong></p>\n<p>Our relationship with MakerDAO and its officers is free of any conflicts or potential issues.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product:</strong></p>\n<p>Neither Realize nor the Fund is qualified to provide tax advice. We kindly recommend that potential investors into the Fund seek qualified tax advice to understand any current or potential future tax implications before investing in $RBILL tokens.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is due to launch in October 2024 and as such we are unable to provide any historical performance records relative to benchmark.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports.</strong></p>\n<p>A daily NAV report will be issued by the Fund Administrator. We are also currently working towards Chainlink Proof of Reserves adoption together with a Transparency Committee which could include members of SparkDAO / MakerDAO. The Transparency Committee is planned to have view-access of both bank and custody accounts.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product:</strong></p>\n<p>Ascent has been appointed by the Fund as the fund administrator, pursuant to the terms of the administrative services agreement. The Administrator is responsible for providing services required in connection with the Fund’s operations, including (i) calculating the net asset value of the Fund; (ii) verifying the identity of investors for the purposes of anti-money laundering regulations; and (iii) preparing and submitting to the Fund and the Fund Manager all ancillary documentation that are used for the annual audit and the preparation of financial statements. The annual financial statements will be prepared in line with Ascent’s policies and procedures, and will be audited by <a href=\"https://www.grantthornton.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Grant Thornton</a>.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product:</strong></p>\n<p>Our product is built using Solidity for Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) but is designed with future scalability in mind, as we plan to extend support to non-EVM virtual machines. The core of the system operates through a series of smart contracts that manage tokenization, user interactions, price oracles, and whitelisting functions, all while ensuring high security and compliance standards.</p>\n<p>At the heart of our system is the TokenManager contract, which holds the core logic for both the current and future tokens issued on the platform. The TokenManager contract orchestrates essential functions like minting and burning tokens, managing pricing through oracles, and interacting with permissioned lists of users. The modular nature of TokenManager allows the system to be easily extendable, making it adaptable to new types of tokens or evolving business logic.</p>\n<p>Supporting the TokenManager are a series of contracts designed for specific purposes. Hub.sol handles user requests for minting and redeeming tokens, ensuring that collateral is deposited and tokens are issued appropriately. The Hub contract serves as the central point for token operations, coordinating between various contracts in the system, including pricing and whitelisting mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The ListAggregator.sol contract ensures that users meet all necessary criteria by checking multiple whitelists, providing an aggregated view of allowed or disallowed accounts. This is critical in ensuring compliance with various KYC and AML regulations, as different token providers may have specific rules for whitelisted addresses. Administrators can add or remove users from these lists using the ManagedList.sol contract, which allows flexibility in managing permissions.</p>\n<p>The TokenPrice.sol contract acts as a price oracle, allowing specific operators to adjust token prices within predefined limits. This is key for ensuring that the system remains adaptive to market conditions while maintaining strict control over price changes. The use of price oracles ensures that token minting and redemption operations always occur at a fair value, protecting both the platform and its users from price manipulation or errors.</p>\n<p>One of the standout features of our system is its ability to handle multiple tokens and operations simultaneously. The Proxy.sol contract provides upgradability, ensuring that the system can evolve without disrupting existing operations. This is particularly important for a platform dealing with real-world assets (RWAs), as regulations and business requirements may change over time.</p>\n<p>A crucial aspect of the Realize platform is its integration with Fireblocks, which plays a key role in securing all on-chain operations. Every critical operation, from minting and burning tokens to handling sensitive user-related functions, is tied to a Fireblocks MPC (Multi-Party Computation) Vault. This means that no single entity or person can execute an operation on their own; instead, it requires approval from multiple authorized parties, making the system more secure and reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.</p>\n<p>The Fireblocks Vault ensures that all actions require a series of cryptographic signatures from a committee before execution. This process not only protects the system from insider threats but also provides a transparent approval chain for every transaction. Every operation is logged and requires multiple approvals, ensuring that no unauthorized action can take place.</p>\n<p>We will further enhance security by incorporating Chainlink Proof of Reserve (PoR), which ensures that the collateral backing the tokens is fully transparent. By integrating PoR, users and regulators can verify in real-time that the system is appropriately collateralized, thus enhancing trust in the platform.</p>\n<p>From an operational perspective, Realize connects to Ascent Group’s systems, which handle the onboarding and KYC processes. Ascent’s technology, including its global ID coverage and automated transaction monitoring, ensures that users are onboarded quickly and securely. All user information remains confidential, and Realize does not store any sensitive personal data. Ascent’s systems, integrated with One Constellation, allow for real-time access to fund data, ensuring transparency for both fund managers and investors.</p>\n<p>By combining the security and transparency provided by Fireblocks, Chainlink PoR, and Ascent’s onboarding technology, Realize offers a secure, compliant, and scalable solution for managing tokenized real-world assets. The integration of both on-chain and off-chain security measures ensures that users can confidently participate in the platform, knowing that their assets and personal data are fully protected.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>5. What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>The smart contracts for our product underwent a comprehensive audit by Zokyo Security in July 2024. The audit yielded a high score of 98/100, with no critical or high-severity issues. All identified medium and low-severity issues were resolved, and the audit covered key areas, including test coverage (97.27%), security against reentrancy, and overall adherence to industry best practices. The audit report confirmed that our contracts are well-crafted, organized, and secure for handling token minting and redemption processes backed by real-world assets.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs:</strong></p>\n<p>The team behind Realize has been involved in DAOs since early 2020. The primary experience has been in establishing the legal framework in establishing a Marshall Island DAO and guiding the process of establishing and getting community-approval for establishing the DAO. In addition to that, the Realize ecosystem team is in close contact with several major DAOs to invest into and diversify their treasury into the Fund. We expect to go through several other DAO governance processes to allocate part of the treasury of those DAOs to the Fund in the coming weeks.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Realize is an RWA tokenization, building out a range of tokenized regulated fund products, bringing yield-bearing assets on-chain and making them fully compatible and usable within Web3. As part of this ecosystem, Realize will launch a utility token in Q4 of this year. Realize is entirely self-funded and has no external investors, making it a pure token distribution that will be maximally community-oriented and aligned.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/v4f5MqKB2D21YAYa484NaitTKeC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_624x339.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"v4f5MqKB2D21YAYa484NaitTKeC\" width=\"624\" height=\"339\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_624x339.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_936x508.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/9/d9be30dfd4e6309e98df61cad4f2b921e325a71a_2_1248x678.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEAF8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Unlike other RWA ecosystems, where the token is a limited governance token with no real rights or participation in the success of the ecosystem, the Realize token will be deeply embedded in the Realize platform to directly benefit token holders from the growth and success of the Realize RWA ecosystem. In addition to that, token holders can unlock various rewards, access premium features, fee rebates and actively participate in governance decisions. It serves as a key driver of engagement within the ecosystem, encouraging active involvement and long-term commitment from the community.</p>\n<p>We take great inspiration from the incredible success of $MKR (now $SKY) and the MakerDAO governance process and community and want to work together to build the future of finance on-chain. Realize proposes to offer MakerDAO / SparkDAO <em><strong>up to a 5% token allocation and airdrop to $SKY holders</strong></em>. Details of the token airdrop and distribution will be discussed by both communities.</p>\n<p>Apart from the token allocation, the Realize team is very happy to work closely with the MakerDAO / SparkDAO teams on future products and tokenized assets. In addition to that, we are happy to work closely on regulatory support in Abu Dhabi and the UAE, and helping the team with any matters related to becoming operational, domiciled or even regulated in the UAE. We are also happy to use our network of investors, policy makers and partners to support the SKY ecosystem.<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>Realize serves as the gateway to an expansive DeFi ecosystem composed of a diverse range of dApps, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their investments in tokenized RWAs. Unlike competitors who restrict tokenization to isolated silos, Realize aims in the future to integrate these tokenized assets into a seamless and interconnected environment, allowing them to be used as collateral for additional yield-generating opportunities across multiple dApps within a regulatory compliant environment.</p>\n<p>The Realize ecosystem team is currently in close discussions with several major L1 Blockchains to offer the tokenized $RBILL on their network and to partner with major DeFi applications within the ecosystem to accept $RBILL as collateral for trading pairs, collateral-backed lending protocols and more. We will work towards $RBILL being accepted as a secure form of collateral across all major L1 Blockchains.</p>\n<p>Through Realize’s institutional-grade DeFi platforms, investors holding tokenized assets gain access to a wide range of opportunities to generate additional yield:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/0/706204e5d932038f7c80f17c50293dcaeb0df4a8.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/g2btRHA1iehlC7nd33emWLY0Wi4.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/0/706204e5d932038f7c80f17c50293dcaeb0df4a8_2_621x350.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"g2btRHA1iehlC7nd33emWLY0Wi4\" width=\"621\" height=\"350\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/0/706204e5d932038f7c80f17c50293dcaeb0df4a8_2_621x350.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/0/706204e5d932038f7c80f17c50293dcaeb0df4a8_2_931x525.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/0/706204e5d932038f7c80f17c50293dcaeb0df4a8_2_1242x700.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D2CAF1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realizeassets.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Realize</a>: Realize is a cutting-edge tokenization platform that serves as the gateway for RWAs into the broader DeFi ecosystem.

I hope you can provide clear answers and address any concerns that other potential users like myself might have. Here are my key questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How is the security of my DAI deposit ensured?</strong><br>\nWhat mechanisms are in place to prevent the theft or loss of funds while interacting with the <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Spark.fi</a> protocol?

How decentralized is the protocol’s decision-making process, and how can I stay informed of governance updates or participate in governance myself?</li>\n<li><strong>Is there a withdrawal limit or fee structure?</strong><br>\nWhat are the withdrawal policies in terms of limits, fees, or delays? Are there any situations where withdrawals might be temporarily paused?</li>\n<li><strong>How are interest rates or yields determined?</strong><br>\nCould you explain how yields are calculated on DAI deposits and what factors might affect the return on investment? Are these yields subject to significant fluctuation?</li>\n<li><strong>What recourse is available in case of loss?</strong><br>\nIn the unfortunate event of a hack, exploit, or catastrophic failure of the protocol, is there any recourse for recovering lost funds?

The funds are segregated from Ledgity Company through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which assigns Delubac AM the mandate to manage the T-Bills portfolio. This SPV is created specifically and exclusively for this application.</p>\n<p><strong>Fund Mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>Investors can deposit USDC into the dedicated Ledgity Vault, structured as a loan to Ledgity’s SPV. In return, the Ledgity protocol issues LUSDC at a 1:1 ratio in the form of ERC-20 tokens, where each LUSDC represents one dollar in the SPV. Transferring the LUSDC token effectively transfers ownership of the underlying claim of USDC. While investors aren’t required to complete KYC, they are subject to on-chain AML monitoring and analysis to ensure compliance.</p>\n<p>LUSDC is a rebase token meaning that the investors see the number of LUSDC tokens growing overtime at the rate equal to the yield generated by the portfolio net of fees.</p>\n<p>Investors can withdraw up to 5% of the Assets Under Management (AUM) instantly. For withdrawals exceeding 5% within a 24-hour period, processing may take 2-3 business days.</p>\n<p><strong>Service Providers Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Delubac Asset Management has a mandate to manage the portfolio of T-Bills. U.S. Treasury Bills are held in custody in a segregated custodial account at Bank Delubac &amp; Cie. BPCE (Natixis Group) is the sub-custodian of this account.</p>\n<p>*In option, we can create a dedicated fund with an agreement of the AMF and a specific objective (US Money Market Fund). The custody is held by CACEIS, a daily NAV is published by CACEIS + AMF agreement, custody and valuation independent from the asset manager, CACEIS is rated A1/A+.</p>\n<p>Issuer Ledgity: Ledgity interface helps investors to track and manage their investments.

And bank Delubac &amp; Cie is the custodian.</p>\n<p>LUSDC represents a loan of USDC to Ledgity’ SPV. This loan is segregated in a SPV, bankruptcy remoteness structure. Therefore, Ledgity delegates a private mandate to Delubac Asset Management in order to manage the portfolio according to the mandate.</p>\n<p>Our setup allows seamless use of Ledgity protocol with no KYC, instant withdrawal and no minimum of investment. The funds are in custody in France at the bank Delubac &amp; Cie.</p>\n<p>Ledgity is regulated as Digital Asset Service Provider by the <a href=\"https://protectepargne.amf-france.org/acteurs-listes-blanches/psan/ledgity-sas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">French Financial Market Authority (AMF) under the number E2022-040</a>.</p>\n<p>Delubac Asset Management is a management company authorized and regulated in France by the Financial Markets Authority, under approval number GP 00009, dated March 31, 2000.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>The funds are held by a dedicated SPV, segregated from the balanced sheet of the issuer, Ledgity. This structure ensures that even in case of bankruptcy of Ledgity, the funds are safe and can be withdrawn by investors. The SPV will be created for Spark and Sky Ecosystem and a legal opinion will be shared in case of selection</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Investors in LUSDC are the only “creditor” of the SPV that holds the funds. They can ask at any time to withdraw their capital in USDC without penalties.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or Sky</strong></p>\n<p>We do not see any conflicts of interest between Ledgity, Delubac AM, their employees and Sky.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>On Market Days, Delubac Asset Management provides to Ledgity the NAV (net of fees) of the portfolio by API.</p>\n<p>Any gain realized between the withdrawal proceeds and the original deposit amount is subject to taxation at the investor’s applicable tax rate.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99057-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99057-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-1\"></a>V. PERFORMANCE, REPORTING, AND TECHNICAL</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable. The proposal is dedicated to Spark Tokenization Grand Prix RFP. Performance will be closely linked to the performance of US T-Bill money market.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p>Ledgity is part of Chainlink BUILD Program. We are working closely with Chainlink in order to add a proof of reserve onchain oracles. This information will come directly from the Bank Delubac &amp; Cie, the custodian.</p>\n<p>This information can be used by Sky and Spark for transparency purposes in order to ensure that USDS holders can see the collateral backing the stablecoin via LUSDC.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product</strong></p>\n<p>The NAV of the portfolio is performed by BPCE Group and Delubac AM on a daily basis. The portfolio will be invested in US T Bills that are liquid, their prices are available on a daily basis on Bloomberg BGN.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p>Ledgity uses blockchains to deliver a secure and seamless investment experience. Our infrastructure ensures scalability, security, and compliance. Here’s a summary of the implementation:</p>\n<p>a) Onchain Overview:</p>\n<p>LUSDC Token Proxy - <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd54d564606611A3502FE8909bBD3075dbeb77813#internaltx\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xd54d564606611A3502FE8909bBD3075dbeb77813</a></p>\n<p>Global Owner: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xe4Af4573bFc5F04D8b84c61744de8A94059f2462\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xe4Af4573bFc5F04D8b84c61744de8A94059f2462</a></p>\n<p>Global Pause: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd4D4c68CE70fa88B9E527DD3A4a6d19c5cbdd4dB\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xd4D4c68CE70fa88B9E527DD3A4a6d19c5cbdd4dB</a></p>\n<p>Global Blacklist: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcA55A2394876e7Cf52e99Ab36Fc9151a7d9CF350\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0xcA55A2394876e7Cf52e99Ab36Fc9151a7d9CF350</a></p>\n<p>Our smart contracts are designed to be flexible, allowing for upgrades as needed. Key functions, like managing the Global Blacklist, are securely controlled by the Ledgity Admin Address to ensure proper oversight and compliance.</p>\n<p>Our contracts are currently deployed on Arbitrum. They can be deployed in a day on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>b) LUSDC: A standard Upgradable OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation with several modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The LToken contract verifies that all holders are not on the global blacklist.</li>\n<li>Burn - Investors can initiate a withdrawal by requesting an “instantWithdrawal” or “requestWithdrawal”.</li>\n<li>Mint - New LUSDC tokens are created during deposits and as rewards for holders.</li>\n<li>Implements an auto-compounding reward system for token holders.</li>\n<li>The contract implements a fee system for withdrawals, with adjustable rates and tier-based exemptions. For Spark Tokenization Grand Prix withdrawal fees will be set at 0%</li>\n<li>A withdrawal queue system is implemented to manage liquidity and handle large withdrawals.</li>\n<li>The contract maintains a retention rate to limit asset exposure on-chain.</li>\n<li>Includes a “repatriate” function for fund management between the contract and a fund wallet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>c) Transfers:</p>\n<p>LUSDC tokens can be freely transferred between Arbitrum or Ethereum addresses using transfer or transferFrom functions. Each transaction is verified to ensure that neither the sender nor the receiver is on the global blacklist. The contract also implements a system of transfer listeners, allowing other contracts to be notified of LUSDC transfers.</p>\n<p>**d) Black list:</p>\n<p>For compliance and regulatory purposes, we apply AML enforcement through a global blacklist function to ensure that illicit transactions cannot impact the rest of the investors. Addresses on the blacklist cannot make deposits, withdrawals, or transfers of LUSDC tokens. Withdrawal requests from addresses that become blacklisted are frozen and can be managed separately.**</p>\n<p>e) Additional Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Global pause functionality for emergency situations.</li>\n<li>Detailed event logging for deposits, withdrawals, and other activities.</li>\n<li>Separate management of “big” withdrawal requests exceeding half of the retention rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>f) Security Measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use of OpenZeppelin’s safe transfer functions for ERC20 tokens.</li>\n<li>Implementation of reentrancy guards for critical functions.</li>\n<li>Upgradeable contract structure with proper initialization checks.</li>\n<li>Clearly defined access control for administrative functions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>g) Additional Services:</p>\n<p>Investor Portal: <a href=\"https://ledgity.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ledgity.finance</a> allows Investors to manage and track their portfolio with ease, offering real-time access to account information.</p>\n<p><strong>5.

SKY ECOSYSTEM</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with Sky and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>This application is our first contribution to the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the Spark Star and Sky ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>LUSDC offers crypto native investors an easy access to TradFi institutional asset managers. Pierre-Yves Dittlot, the CEO and Founder of Ledgity, has 18 years of experience in the asset management and private banking industry, managing up to $800M. For several years, he worked with financial institutions to promote the innovation brought by blockchain technology. By onboarding LUSDC, the Sky ecosystem may easily access other products offered by Ledgity in the future and co-create tailor made products for the Sky ecosystem. Ledgity promises clear transparency. Accelerated by Chainlink, Ledgity will create a Proof of Reserve oracles on-chain.</p>\n<p>Ledgity aims to create a Council with external key leaders from the TradFi and DeFi industry. The Council will be in charge of making proposals for the creation of new products as well as contributing to the asset allocation of a future yield bearing stable asset backed by an onchain reserve of RWA, actively managed. The Sky ecosystem will be able to participate as a leader, helping us to shape the future of finance.</p>\n<p>Finally, Ledgity launched his governance and utility token, the LDY token. We are happy to dedicate 10% of LDY supply to the Sky ecosystem as additional incentives.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>Not yet. As soon as we reach the first $20M of AUM, we will work on integrations with key DeFi protocols such as Morpho, Euler, Uniswap, Curve and more.</p>\n<p>Our vision is to make our products widely accessible across different ecosystems and protocols to benefit onchain investors.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other Stars?</strong></p>\n<p>Ledgity is working to launch a permissionless yield bearing stable asset backed by an onchain RWA reserve, actively managed by Ledgity Council. As mentioned above, Ledgity Council will be composed of key leaders from the TradFi and the DeFi industry. The purpose of this product is to provide key benefits for crypto native investors: permissionless, high yield, low risk, instant liquidity, instant yield distribution, resilient, fully transparent with onchain reserve and Chainlink Proof of Reserve, backed by RWA, decentralized management by the Council.</p>\n<p>We will be happy to collaborate with the Sky ecosystem to understand what other strategies/exposures might be suitable and to launch new product on demand.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-delubac-asset-management-x-ledgity/25152\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-delubac-asset-management-x-ledgity/25152","pubDate":"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 18:56:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25152"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-delubac-asset-management-x-ledgity/25152.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Delubac Asset Management x Ledgity"},"filter":false},{"title":"Questions about Negative MKR Balances and Their Impact on Governance Polls","dc:creator":"ohho","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>Dear MakerDAO community,</p>\n<p>While reviewing governance poll results, I’ve noticed some concerning patterns that I’d like to bring to the community’s attention and seek clarification on.</p>\n<p>I’ve observed multiple instances where wallets with “0 MKR” or “≈0 MKR” voting power have participated in governance polls.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/0/1/011b06ffd29047f720b885e32fbc561d08d38739.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9MnLkJijmVoloxQkqh9cHyzfEB.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/1/011b06ffd29047f720b885e32fbc561d08d38739_2_690x488.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"9MnLkJijmVoloxQkqh9cHyzfEB\" width=\"690\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/1/011b06ffd29047f720b885e32fbc561d08d38739_2_690x488.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/1/011b06ffd29047f720b885e32fbc561d08d38739_2_1035x732.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/0/1/011b06ffd29047f720b885e32fbc561d08d38739_2_1380x976.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F7F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Upon closer inspection, I’ve discovered something even more alarming - wallets with <strong>negative MKR balances</strong> appear to be voting and impacting poll results.</p>\n<p>Let me provide a specific example:</p>\n<p>In Poll 232 (<a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmR4A4dT\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Maker Governance - MIP9 Community Greenlight Poll - renBTC - July 20, 2020</a>), there were <strong>30 wallets</strong> that voted with a Total Voting Power of <strong>21,315.378 MKR</strong>.

We estimate that SG Group fees (both for SGIS and SG-Forge) will be in the range of 10 basic points (bps) per annum.</p>\n<p>Subscription fees in case of subscription via USD Stablecoins will be up to 15 bps, corresponding to a cost pass-through that we intend to reduce as much as possible prior to execution.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable.</p>\n<p>There are no other expenses associated with the products.

If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p>The EMTN includes a put option with a 5 business days’ notice period. This put option can be triggered on any day by the client with the issuer SGIS.</p>\n<p>In addition, Societe Generale will provide a secondary market on the EMTNs, and will commit to buy back the EMTN at their accrued value, with no fees or bid/ask spread, through a T+1 settlement period (in fiat) or T+2 settlement period in stablecoin (USDC or PYUSD or any other pre-agreed USD stablecoin). This commitment will be formalized by a liquidity letter between Societe Generale and the client.</p>\n<p><strong>16. With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made?

MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>On January 16th, 2022 – SG-Forge has granted a loan to Societe Generale to refinance covered bonds held by the bank in the form of Security Tokens issued natively on the Ethereum public blockchain. SG-Forge funded this loan in the crypto market by borrowing DAI stablecoins from MakerDAO. Same Security Tokens were pledged to the benefit of the MakerDAO protocol.</p>\n<p>SG-Forge has been able to enter into contractual agreements with the DAO using the voting process of the protocol. This financial, legal, and technological innovation implied different proposals and governance votes from the DAO community, notably:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A MakerDAO Initial Collateral Application made in September 20212</li>\n<li>A MakerDAO Governance Poll and Executive Vote to accept the proposed Security Tokens as collateral for the transaction and elect a Maker Representative for executing the legal documentation and administrative tasks on behalf of the DAO</li>\n<li>On August 2nd 2022 the MakerDAO community approved a DAI stablecoins credit line to SG-Forge.</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"10605\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/s/9de0a6/48.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/security-tokens-refinancing-mip6-application-for-ofh-tokens/10605\">[Security Tokens Refinancing] MIP6 Application for OFH Tokens</a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/c/legacy/co/17\"><span data-category-id=\"17\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #ED207B; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF; --parent-category-badge-color: #231F20;\" data-parent-category-id=\"74\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category --has-parent\" title=\"This subcategory is used for posting and discussion of MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Applications.\"><span class=\"badge-category__name\">Collateral Onboarding Applications</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    Dear MakerDAO Community, \nWe submit to you, on behalf of European investment firm Societe Generale-Forge, this MIP6 application for discussion and approval of Security Tokens refinancing.

Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>SmartCash is a structured product that meets Spark / Maker requirements in terms of yield exposure to short term US treasuries.</p>\n<p>Societe Generale is also one of the market leaders in structuring and issuance of a wide palette of structured products across asset classes and that are sold to institutional investors globally. Upon successful onboarding and clear understanding of the specific financial situation of the DAOs, SG structuring specialists would be able to suggest appropriate investment products. More information is available here: <a href=\"https://sg-structuredproducts.com/societe-generale-group\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SG Structured Products (sg-structuredproducts.com)</a>.</p>\n<p>Building a relationship with one of the very few systemic banks being involved in the permissionless blockchain ecosystem would also benefit the DAOs, improve its reputation and attract institutional investors in the respective ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>3.

Product Information</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product</strong><br>\nWe propose Sky allocate up to 10% of the $1 billion pool to global government bonds outside of the U.S. to enhance risk-adjusted returns. To facilitate this, we offer tokenized global government non-US short-term bonds.</p>\n<p>The proposed product is a tokenized investment in global government bonds outside the U.S., focusing on short-term bonds to minimize risk exposure.</p>\n<p>Key features of this tokenized product are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Underlying assets</strong>: global government bonds ex. US - either direct bond purchases, managed funds or ETFs</li>\n<li><strong>Short-Term Duration</strong>: Focus on short-term bonds to reduce risk exposure.</li>\n<li><strong>Good Yield</strong>: Outperform the S&amp;P U.S. Ultra Short Treasury Bill &amp; Bond Index.</li>\n<li><strong>Standardized and consistent investment process</strong>: We perform extensive due diligence on all assets to be included in the portfolio to ensure high-quality assets with proper durations. We integrate key fixed-income factors such as value, momentum, size, and liquidity into the asset allocation process. By actively managing exposure to these factors, the portfolio can achieve more stable and predictable returns.</li>\n<li><strong>Capital Preservation</strong>: The focus on high-quality, short-term bonds and active risk management aligns with the capital preservation goals of Sky. The portfolio offers a low-risk investment option, suitable for conservative investors seeking stable returns.</li>\n<li><strong>Income Generation</strong>: The portfolio’s emphasis on bonds with attractive yields offers a reliable source of income, appealing to income-focused investors. The regular coupon payments provide a steady income stream, supplementing other sources of income.</li>\n<li><strong>Broad diversification</strong>: The portfolio’s broad diversification across geographies and issuers, reducing exposure to specific risks and enhancing overall portfolio resilience. The inclusion of factors such as credit quality, value, and liquidity provides an additional layer of risk management and return potential. Sky can benefit from the portfolio’s systematic approach to capturing risk premia, aligning with their need for efficient risk-adjusted returns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong><br>\nThe underlying assets will be non-US government bonds. The countries and bonds are selected using a standardized and consistent investment process.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the token holder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong><br>\nThe yield is compounded within the token.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong><br>\nThe investment manager and the Fund entity are both domiciled in Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong><br>\nAsset eligibility criteria: Where the most efficient and liquid exposure to a country’s government bond is via a managed fund or ETFs, there is a requirement of  AUM greater or equal to $200 mil.</p>\n<p>Concentration limit: no investment including investment in a single bond, in a single country, a single managed fund, or a single ETF can exceed 20% of AUM.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong><br>\nNo.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc). Provide flow-charts or diagrams for all related entities and counterparties, if available.</strong><br>\nAll counterparties and service providers involved in RWAx are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Custodian</strong>: Certane</li>\n<li><strong>Trustee</strong>: True Oak</li>\n<li><strong>Fund Administrator</strong>: Automic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please refer to Question 14 for flowcharts and diagrams.</p>\n<p><strong>8.

(e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong><br>\nThe product is permissioned based on interaction with the issuer. In the flows below, any investor transaction action with the deployer wallet will need to have a KYC check and whitelisted address. This is a traditional fund admin KYC check. Fundamentally, any redemption or subscriptions will need to be done by a permissioned wallet.</p>\n<p>If the wallet is not whitelisted, no investment action is taken.</p>\n<p>No other restrictions apply on the token.</p>\n<p><strong>12. What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong><br>\nAll the assets will be liquid. The goal is that redemption/subscription acts as a price support mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>13. What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong><br>\nExpected Two Business Days.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process.

Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong><br>\nNo, but asset vehicles used, for example ETFs, are very liquid.</p>\n<p>The portfolio’s focus on liquid assets ensures that we can meet Sky’s liquidity requirements. There are allocation decisions like using ETFs and/or liquid funds that can enhance liquidity as these vehicles often provide better liquidity than individual bonds and can be easily traded. We carefully weigh direct individual bonds, AUM and liquidity in our portfolio allocation decisions. We set strict requirements that need to be met around quality, liquidity and diversification.</p>\n<p>There is no lock-up or minimum holding period.</p>\n<p><strong>16.

What are your future development plans for the product?</strong><br>\nTokenising more asset classes to enhance diversification, including but not limited to: real estate, stock, corporate bonds, commodities, venture capital, private debt, private equity and art.</p>\n<p>In possible future circumstances, the tokenised versions of the Fund’s Unit will be tradable on a private placement basis or on a digital exchange, potentially offering further liquidity opportunities for Unit Holders.

Legal Structure</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates.</strong><br>\nThe product is run by DigitalX Asset Management as the investment manager through the Real World Asset Tokenisation Fund (the ‘Fund’) in Australia. This Fund is open to wholesale investors. The trustee of the Fund is True Oak Investments Ltd (ABN 81 002 558 956) (the Trustee).</p>\n<p>We have feeder fund structures in Singapore and Marshall Islands that feed directly into the Fund. We are open to discussing a more favourable and synergistic legal structure to accommodate Sky.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong><br>\nThe Trustee of the Fund is a holder of the Australian Financial Services Licence (AFS Licence No, 238184). The Fund operates in compliance with regulations by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, and exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong><br>\nThe Fund is an unregistered managed investment scheme structured as a unit trust.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong><br>\nThe Fund as the unit trust sits at the center of the transaction and it owns the underlying assets both legally and beneficially. The Trustee only acts on behalf of the unit holders/token holders. All trust assets are legally separate from the Trustee’s personal assets and are in the custody of the custodian. The Unit Trust can survive the insolvency of the Investment Manager, the Trustee, the Custodian or any service provider.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong><br>\nWe will issue tokens (SkyX) at the feeder entity in either Marshall Islands or Singapore. The SkyX tokens will represent the proportionate right to the revenue generated by the SPV from the Fund units.</p>\n<p>We are open to discussing which structure and token would be most appropriate and beneficial for Sky.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong><br>\nNo.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong><br>\nNo conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong><br>\nThe Fund complies with Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and follows Common Reporting Standard (CRS).</p>\n<p>The Fund’s investments can include shares/units of ETFs and funds. These funds can be subject to withholding tax on any income received from underlying bonds, depending on their jurisdictions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99027-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99027-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-5\"></a>V.

Who provides these?</strong><br>\nOnchain lookthrough: Anyone can monitor the reserve/underlying assets on-chain</p>\n<p>Daily performance published online: Daily indicative NAV via the website</p>\n<p>Published Monthly fund statement and a monthly NAV via the website.</p>\n<p>NAV data is aggregated market data of the current holdings of the portfolio.</p>\n<p>Historical NAV data download is available on the website.</p>\n<p>This transparency fosters trust and confidence in the product, making it an attractive option for investors who value clarity and simplicity.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product</strong><br>\nThe Fund accountant prepares:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a monthly report on the net asset value of the Fund;</li>\n<li>an annual statement including audited financial report for the Fund and annual tax statement following the end of financial year at 30 June;</li>\n<li>regular updates from the Manager on the performance of the Fund and its investments; and</li>\n<li>a transaction statement each time you make an investment, reinvestment, or withdrawal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Fund is audited annually by a reputable auditor.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong><br>\nWe deliver a secure and compliant investor experience. We facilitate off-chain digital experience and on-chain fund investing options. Actions are synchronized on-chain.</p>\n<p>We have an ERC-20 token that represents the Fund’s Net Asset Value at a daily level. We post the NAV holdings daily to the contract. Separately, we have a website where we provide current and historical net asset value at a daily level and at the struck end of month net asset value and end of month units outstanding.</p>\n<p>We distribute this token via platforms or directly to KYC/AML investors.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong><br>\nLast smart contract audit was performed by Hashlock in April 2024.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99027-vi-makerdao-ecosystem-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99027-vi-makerdao-ecosystem-6\"></a>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong><br>\nAlignment of interest with Sky (MakerDAO), DigitalX Digital Asset Fund, also managed by DigitalX Asset Management, holds MakerDAO tokens.</p>\n<p>DigitalX has previously worked on a DAO proof of concept to create decentralized investment validation with ArbelaDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong><br>\nDiversification is a cornerstone of sound investment strategy as it is crucial for mitigating risk. In today’s globalized economy, investors seek to broaden their portfolios beyond traditional asset classes and geographical boundaries. Investing in global bonds, especially those outside the US, we can provide a number of diversification benefits to Sky.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Mitigation</strong><br>\nWhile U.S. Treasury bills are secure, they are not immune to market shifts that can affect their performance. By investing in high quality bonds from other governments around the world, Sky’s exposure will spread across different economic environments and interest rate regimes. These countries can be at different points in their economic and interest rate cycles compared to the US, so their bonds can offer a hedge against US idiosyncratic market volatility. By holding a diversified mix of bonds from different countries, we will reduce Sky’s reliance on the U.S. economic cycle and interest rate environment. This strategy not only aims to preserve capital but also seeks to enhance returns by taking advantage of different global economic cycles. In the long run, this approach can lead to a more resilient portfolio, capable of weathering various economic conditions while still providing steady income and capital preservation.</p>\n<p><strong>Hedge against Currency risk</strong><br>\nGlobal government bonds can offer a valuable hedge against currency risk, particularly in the context of long-term forecasts for the U.S. dollar. Vanguard’s proprietary model estimates that the U.S. dollar is roughly 12% overvalued against a basket of five leading currencies heading into 2024. In the coming decade, it is estimated that the probability of some dollar depreciation at about 75%, with a modest decline of 1.1% annualized the most likely outcome (<a href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/vemo/vemo-us-dollar.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Source</a>). Investing in bonds denominated in foreign currencies allows the portfolio to be diversified beyond the U.S. dollar. If the dollar weakens as forecasted, the value of the portfolio’s holding in stronger foreign currencies could increase, therefore boosting Sky’s overall returns. This potential appreciation in foreign currencies could help offset any declines in the US dollar’s value, effectively providing a natural hedge against the risks associated with a weakening domestic currency.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong><br>\nThe DigitalX Real World Asset Tokenisation Fund token - the Fund is about to list for both wholesale and retail markets, respectively on a Web3 RWA platform.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong><br>\nWe currently have tokenized Australian residential properties, Australian ETFs and Australian corporate bonds. We also have the appropriate licensing and technical capability to tokenize other types of assets such as commodities, venture capital, private debt, private equity and we plan to continue to expand this asset base. We can provide Spark or other SubDAOs with exposure across multiple asset classes across different risk profiles, investment horizons and geographic locations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99027-vii-investment-process-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99027-vii-investment-process-7\"></a>VII. Investment Process</h2>\n<p><strong>Due Diligence</strong><br>\nWe screen all available investments in government bonds globally. We then use a proprietary, data-driven, universal scoring process - referred to as the Universal Scoring Matrix (USM) - through which investment selection criteria are programmed into a scorecard. The USM helps us compare each investment opportunity using a standardized and consistent approach for scoring various attributes of the investment. A higher score may reflect a superior risk/reward investment proposition.</p>\n<p>Criteria used to evaluate each asset include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Liquidity Screening: The portfolio will prioritize assets with high liquidity, ensuring that trades can be executed efficiently and cost-effectively. We have an AUM threshold (for now, at least $200mil AUM), high trading volumes, and well-established issuers. This ensures that the portfolio can be adjusted with minimal impact on market prices. We avoid illiquid assets by excluding funds and bonds with known liquidity issues or those that are difficult to trade, such as smaller issues or bonds from issuers with lower visibility.</li>\n<li>Asset performance compared to relevant benchmark</li>\n<li>Identification of any legal or reputation risks. We establish minimum rating requirements for assets to be included in the portfolio. This reduces exposure to lower-rated, riskier bonds and ensures a higher quality of credit risk.</li>\n<li>Operating track record including how long the funds have been in operation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All assets must pass this due diligence to be included in the portfolio.</p>\n<p><strong>Asset Allocation</strong><br>\nOur asset allocation process utilizes transparent and efficient allocation methodologies to select underlying assets that maximize risk-adjusted returns and diversification benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Factor-based allocation</strong>: Instead of market-value weighting potentially leading to over-concentration in issuers with large amounts of outstanding debt, we allocate assets based on risk-weighted approaches to allocate assets. Our asset allocation approach targets specific characteristics or factors that have historically been associated with higher returns or lower risk. Those factors include size, credit quality, value and momentum signals.</p>\n<p><strong>Regular Rebalancing</strong>: The portfolio will be regularly rebalanced to maintain target allocations to the identified factors and to ensure compliance with risk parameters. This process involves adjusting positions to reflect changes in market conditions, issuer fundamentals, and investor preferences.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Monitoring and Management</strong>: Ongoing risk monitoring will be conducted to assess the portfolio’s exposure to interest rate risk, credit risk, and other market risks. The portfolio’s duration, credit quality, and sector exposures will be actively managed to align with the investment objectives and risk tolerance.</p>\n<p><strong>Macroeconomic and Market Analysis</strong>: The investment team will closely monitor global economic indicators, central bank policies, and market trends to inform strategic decisions. This analysis will guide adjustments to the portfolio’s allocation to different regions, sectors, and factors.</p>\n<p><strong>Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis</strong>: The portfolio will undergo regular stress testing and scenario analysis to evaluate its performance under various market conditions. This process helps identify potential vulnerabilities and ensures that the portfolio remains resilient in the face of adverse events.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-99027-viii-conclusion-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99027-viii-conclusion-8\"></a>VIII. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Fund represents a unique opportunity for Spark to diversify its government bonds assets across different economic environments and interest rate regimes. The portfolio helps reduce concentration risk and US$ currency risk, manage volatility and preserve capital while capturing attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Product Information</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tDescribe the product</strong></p>\n<p>Under this proposal, SparkDAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) would be invested in the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, which is the world’s first U.S. registered money market mutual fund offered and issued on blockchain in tokenized form. An investment in the BENJI Token, which is a digital asset security that represents one share of the Fund, can help diversify SparkDAO’s DAI reserves and/or treasury into a steady, income-generating asset that seeks to provide capital preservation, and its liquidity preservation characteristics present a unique opportunity for SparkDAO’s reserves.</p>\n<p>While minor, many of the largest stablecoins have faced price volatility in the peg of their stablecoin. Similar to the objective of stablecoins, the Fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 share price (NAV). The Fund has maintained this NAV since inception, having provided price stability, and is also required by law to provide quarterly public disclosure of all holdings. The Fund’s 7-day current yield is 5.12% as of August 31, 2024, with a 20 basis point net expense ratio. Fund shares are offered without sales charge. The Fund is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and invests 99.5% of its total assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash.</p>\n<p>The BENJI Token is designed to provide transparency by using blockchain technology to process transactions and record share ownership. The Fund’s transfer agent maintains the official record of share ownership via a proprietary blockchain-integrated system that utilizes public blockchains as the source of truth for recording transactional activity, known as the Benji platform. It’s important to note that there is no personally identifiable information stored on the blockchain, only transaction-level data. Because the Benji platform records transactions and Fund ownership via public blockchains, and because this on-chain record serves as the true system of record with no shadow record keeping behind the scenes, SparkDAO would have real-time transparency and assurance that their assets are in good stead. SparkDAO can interact with their account at any time using our Benji Institutional Web Portal and provide a look through to their holdings using their preferred block explorer, such as Etherscan for Ethereum.</p>\n<p>Please see below for a preview of our Institutional Web Portal supporting the BENJI Token.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/2/923383ea373ea42777a2ab1719512e3f48c9caad.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kRm541eDuZ4zSnY9T7kSIwl9khT.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/2/923383ea373ea42777a2ab1719512e3f48c9caad_2_690x437.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"kRm541eDuZ4zSnY9T7kSIwl9khT\" width=\"690\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/2/923383ea373ea42777a2ab1719512e3f48c9caad_2_690x437.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/2/923383ea373ea42777a2ab1719512e3f48c9caad.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/2/923383ea373ea42777a2ab1719512e3f48c9caad.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1F272E\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/9/3901cbdcce3f76da77e544c0a9fedfd3ed58b9c7.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/88j3ZKHQlqk4bdvJgumsZtuIUAf.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/9/3901cbdcce3f76da77e544c0a9fedfd3ed58b9c7_2_690x437.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"88j3ZKHQlqk4bdvJgumsZtuIUAf\" width=\"690\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/9/3901cbdcce3f76da77e544c0a9fedfd3ed58b9c7_2_690x437.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/9/3901cbdcce3f76da77e544c0a9fedfd3ed58b9c7.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/9/3901cbdcce3f76da77e544c0a9fedfd3ed58b9c7.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"383E45\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Please see below for previews of the modal interface for ZeroHash on Benji Institutional.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e2b54604d85c7fe7c5f1cd39e8e8782d36aee87a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wlyhFEhFMl44n36ebWnNtPKYZOa.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e2b54604d85c7fe7c5f1cd39e8e8782d36aee87a_2_690x437.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"wlyhFEhFMl44n36ebWnNtPKYZOa\" width=\"690\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e2b54604d85c7fe7c5f1cd39e8e8782d36aee87a_2_690x437.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e2b54604d85c7fe7c5f1cd39e8e8782d36aee87a.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e2b54604d85c7fe7c5f1cd39e8e8782d36aee87a.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"3A3F43\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/a/9a129646b69952e99f16e31f3bbe2eb2fe44a5c4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lYZlSJtjLacd9FKsNM0LqvlY9xi.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/a/9a129646b69952e99f16e31f3bbe2eb2fe44a5c4_2_690x437.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"lYZlSJtjLacd9FKsNM0LqvlY9xi\" width=\"690\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/a/9a129646b69952e99f16e31f3bbe2eb2fe44a5c4_2_690x437.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/a/9a129646b69952e99f16e31f3bbe2eb2fe44a5c4.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/a/9a129646b69952e99f16e31f3bbe2eb2fe44a5c4.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"363C41\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>While BENJI Token subscriptions and redemptions are typically done in fiat, namely USD, investors in the BENJI Token are not required to utilize a bank account. Zero Hash conversion services, which are available on the Benji platform, allow investors to convert US Dollar Coins (USDC) to USD, which in turn is transferred to their Franklin Templeton account and used to seamlessly purchase BENJI Tokens. Investors in the Fund may also use Zero Hash services to convert USD proceeds from the sale of BENJI Tokens to USDC. These conversions do not require USDC being on the same network as BENJI Tokens.</p>\n<p>Ensuring the safety and stability of treasury and reserve funds is of the utmost importance and, as a result, many invest in stablecoins to try to preserve capital. Stablecoin providers invest the underlying assets across many different investment types to generate return but rarely pass that return to holders of the stablecoin. In the case of the BENJI Token, we believe that SparkDAO’s reserves and/or treasury can not only receive the benefit of capital preservation but can also earn any income generated from the Fund’s holdings through an asset that lives natively on-chain. Any income generated by investing in the BENJI Token can provide additional capital to aid in the development of new products, technology, or other initiatives deemed important to SparkDAO.</p>\n<p>We would like to advocate for SparkDAO to liquidate a portion of its DAI reserves and/or treasury to invest in the BENJI Token. Please refer to Appendix 1 - <em>Say Hello to Benji</em> for more information on the BENJI Token and process of investing.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund intends to be a “Government money market fund,” as such term is defined in or interpreted under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act). The Fund invests at least 99.5% of its assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash.</p>\n<p>The Fund invests in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. government securities, which may include fixed, floating and variable rate securities.</li>\n<li>Repurchase agreements which are agreements by the Fund to buy Government securities and then to sell the securities back on an agreed upon date (generally, less than seven days) at a higher price, which reflects prevailing short-term interest rates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Fund’s portfolio managers seek to build a diversified portfolio of Government securities. Government securities include those issued by government agencies or instrumentalities, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks, whose securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Government.</p>\n<p>The portfolio managers make the final security selection decisions, consistent with desired overall risk positioning, and based on relative pricing and trading liquidity. Throughout the portfolio construction process, dedicated risk analysts collaborate with the portfolio managers to identify the level and sources of risk and help determine optimal position sizing.</p>\n<p>The Fund only buys securities that the investment manager determines present minimal credit risks. The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 calendar days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average life for its portfolio of 120 calendar days or less, and only buys securities that mature or are deemed to mature in 397 calendar days or less. As of August 31, 2024, the Fund’s weighted average maturity was 16 days, and 27 days as of June 30, 2024.</p>\n<p>The Fund uses the amortized cost method of valuation to seek to maintain a stable $1.00 share price and does not currently intend to impose liquidity fees or redemption gates on Fund redemptions.</p>\n<p>An Institutional Web Portal is available for institutional investors and other investors that require a multi-user interface for Fund subscriptions and redemptions.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>Income received from the Fund are paid daily when its net asset value (NAV) is calculated, which is based on NYSE business days. Your account (via the Institutional Web Portal) begins to receive dividends on the day after the Fund receives your investment, provided the investment is received by the Fund on any business day in good order prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time or the regularly scheduled close of the NYSE, whichever is earlier. Investments received after that time will normally begin to earn dividends on the following business day. Dividends from net investment income are normally declared and distributed daily; these dividends may be reinvested or paid daily to shareholders directly to their account in the form of additional BENJI tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

(e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></p>\n<p>Users of the Benji platform are run through typical KYC/AML verification and are whitelisted inside the contract (using ERC-20 roles).</p>\n<p><strong>12.\tWhat is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Over the last 12 months, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund has done over 1900 transactions. This does not include daily dividend reinvestments. BENJI tokens are not traded on a secondary market. The Fund is organized as an open-end mutual fund so investors can generally purchase or redeem BENJI Tokens directly from the Fund on days that the at the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading.</p>\n<p><strong>13.\tWhat is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>Expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from the Fund depends on the time of the subscription or redemption. If we receive your request in proper form prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time, or the regularly scheduled close of the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier, proceeds sent by ACH generally will be available within two to three business days, however, in most cases, we are able to make the proceeds available same day. Institutional Fed Wires must be received prior to 3 p.m. Pacific time in order to receive same day trade date. We have not had any interruptions in our ability to process redemptions and subscriptions to date.</p>\n<p><strong>14.\tProvide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>Subscriptions and redemptions for the Fund are typically done in fiat via Fed Wire for institutional investors, however, we also provide the ability to convert USDC to BENJI Tokens (or BENJI Tokens to USDC) through an agreement we have with Zero Hash. As mentioned in the question above, all Fund transactions must be conducted via the Institutional Web Portal.</p>\n<p>You can redeem your shares at any time through the Institutional Web Portal, although redemptions of Fund shares will only be processed during normal business hours on business days (NYSE business days). Institutional investors making redemptions via the Institutional Web Portal will use a submitter/approver process to authorize transactions.</p>\n<p>Redemption proceeds will be sent by electronic funds transfer (Fed Wire) from your Institutional Web Portal account to your bank account within seven days after we receive your request in proper form.</p>\n<p>Before requesting to have redemption proceeds sent to a bank account, please make sure we have your current bank account information on file.</p>\n<p>If the bank account was added or changed within the last 15 days, you may be required to provide written instructions signed by all Fund account owners, with a signature guarantee for each Fund account owner.</p>\n<p>If we receive your request in proper form prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time, or the regularly scheduled close of the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier, proceeds sent by ACH generally will be available within two to three business days, however, in most cases, we are able to make the proceeds available same day.</p>\n<p>For a diagram of the flow of funds, please see the graphic in question 7 above.</p>\n<p><strong>15.\tHave any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p>No, however, the investment manager may also hold cash when securities meeting the Fund’s investment criteria are unavailable or to maintain liquidity. The Fund only buys securities that at the time of acquisition are “eligible securities,” as defined by applicable regulation (e.g., government securities, securities issued by a money market fund, and securities that the investment manager determines present minimal credit risks). As previously mentioned, the Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 calendar days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average life for its portfolio of 120 calendar days or less, and only buys securities that mature or are deemed to mature in 397 calendar days or less (or securities otherwise permitted to be purchased because of maturity shortening provisions under applicable regulation).</p>\n<p><strong>16.\tWith what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p>While BENJI Token subscriptions and redemptions are typically done in fiat, namely USD, investors in the BENJI Token are not required to utilize a bank account. Zero Hash conversion services allow investors to convert USDC to USD, which in turn is transferred to their Franklin Templeton account and used to seamlessly purchase BENJI Tokens. Investors in the Fund may also use Zero Hash services to convert USD proceeds from the sale of BENJI Tokens to USDC.</p>\n<p><strong>17.\tWhat are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>We are working on a number of enhancements that bring new functionality to money market funds not seen before, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for subscribing/redeeming using a wider variety of tokens beyond USDC</li>\n<li>Self-custody and web3 wallet interfaces</li>\n<li>A general purpose GraphQL API</li>\n<li>Expansion to issue BENJI on even more blockchain networks</li>\n<li>Further enhancements to peer-to-peer transferability</li>\n<li>Availability through third party distributors/exchanges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These features are naturally subject to regulations and regulatory interpretations. If you would like to learn more about these development efforts, we would be happy to offer discussion with our engineering team members.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned above in question 4 under the “Product Information” section, Franklin Templeton Trust (Trust) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) as an open-end management investment company, consisting of one series – the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund. The Fund intends to be a “Government money market fund,” as such term is defined in or interpreted under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For more information, please contact our team or visit the Fund’s Prospectus: <a href=\"https://www.franklintempleton.com/tools-and-resources/lit-preview/29386/SINGLCLASS/franklin-on-chain-u-s-government-money-fund#prospectus\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund - FOBXX (franklintempleton.com)</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question 1 above.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question 1 above.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s assets are maintained by a qualified custodian and are separate from holdings of the Fund’s investment manager or its affiliates. Because the Fund’s investment manager is prohibited from comingling Fund assets with assets of the investment manager or its affiliates, a bankruptcy by the investment manager or an affiliate would not subject Fund assets to risk of creditors in any bankruptcy proceedings. As previously mentioned, it is also important to note that the Fund intends to be a “government money market fund” as such term is defined in or interpreted under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act). The Fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash.</p>\n<p>Yes, the issuer has more than one product. The Fund’s investment manager is Franklin Advisers, Inc. The investment manager is a wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc., a publicly owned company engaged in the financial services industry through its subsidiaries. Franklin Resources, Inc. is the holding company for various subsidiaries that form the global investment management organization known as Franklin Templeton. With more than 75 years of active management experience, Franklin Templeton offers investment solutions to help clients achieve better outcomes. Our independent specialist investment managers (SIMs) provide clients with deep expertise and boutique specialization across asset classes, investment styles, and geographies. Furthermore, as we mentioned previously, our SIMs are backed by a global infrastructure with at-scale capabilities in research, data analytics, and servicing—this combination of independent, entrepreneurial SIMs and global strength makes Franklin Templeton uniquely agile and allows us to offer 200+ investment strategies across a full range of vehicles.</p>\n<p>The Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund is managed by Franklin Templeton’s Fixed Income portfolio management team.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund is a series of Franklin Templeton Trust, which is an open-end investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act (the “1940”), which confers certain rights to all shareholders, including, among other rights, the right to: (i) vote for the board of trustees; (ii) approve the Fund’s investment management agreement; and (iii) vote on other Fund-specific matters.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the Fund or its officers.</p>\n<p>During the year ended June 30, 2024, neither Franklin Advisers, Inc. (FAV) nor, to the best of its knowledge, its individual <em>advisory affiliates</em> was named as a respondent in any regulatory <em>investment-related</em> <em>proceedings</em> brought by any U.S. federal or state regulatory agency, <em>foreign financial regulatory authority,</em> or <em>self-regulatory organization.</em> Further, in connection with investigations by multiple state attorneys general (“AGs”) concerning Environmental Social and Governance-related investment activities of asset managers in the industry, in 2023, FAV received two Civil Investigative Demands (“CIDs”) issued by AGs of the State of Louisiana and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. We submitted responses to the CIDs in July and August 2023. On February 6, 2024, the Office of the Louisiana AG confirmed that FAV has complied with the CID and that the CID is no longer outstanding. As of the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we have received no further requests for documents or information under the CID from the Office of the Kentucky AG. <em>Investment-related proceedings, findings</em> or <em>orders</em> resulting from the investigations, if any, will be reported, to the extent required and permitted by law, on FAV’s Form ADV filed with the SEC.</p>\n<p>For a summary of <em>investment-related proceedings, findings</em> or <em>orders</em> brought or issued by any such regulatory entity against FAV and/or certain of its <em>advisory affiliates</em> in the past 10 years ended June 30, 2024, as well as certain other regulatory matters, please see Appendix 2 – <em>Franklin Advisers, Inc. Regulatory Summary</em> . In addition, from time to time, FAV and its <em>advisory affiliates</em> receive subpoenas and inquiries, including requests for documents or information, from governmental authorities or regulatory bodies and also are the subject of governmental or regulatory examinations or investigations. <em>Investment-related</em> <em>proceedings</em>, <em>findings</em> or <em>orders</em> resulting from such subpoenas, inquiries, examinations, or investigations, if any, will be reported, to the extent required and permitted by law, on FAV’s Form ADV filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>\n<p>For a summary of material, investment-management-related private litigation in which FAV and/or certain of its <em>advisory affiliates</em> were named as defendants at any point in the past five years ended June 30, 2024, please see Appendix 3 – <em>Franklin Advisers, Inc. 5-Year Litigation Summary</em>. In addition, FAV and its <em>advisory affiliates</em> are from time to time named in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including currently.

(Italicized terms are as defined on SEC’s Form ADV.)</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>As of September 2024, we do not believe that Franklin Templeton or the Fund has any conflicts of interest with MakerDAO.</p>\n<p>Franklin Templeton has a corporate policy aimed to mitigate conflicts of interest. Franklin Templeton’s policy is to take all reasonable steps to maintain and operate effective organizational and administrative controls to identify and manage relevant conflicts that may occur between Franklin Templeton and its clients or between multiple clients.</p>\n<p>The following list provides a summary of the main conflicts we have identified and the controls in place to manage such conflicts within the Franklin Templeton group.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Franklin Templeton Seed Money versus Shareholders’ Investment.</strong> As part of normal business practice, Franklin Templeton will invest money, initially, at the launch of a fund in order to diversify and attract clients. The policy is that an investment by Franklin Templeton is treated in a manner that is believed to not conflict with the interests of any client.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fairness of Trading Allocation and Order Priority among Clients</strong>**.** Franklin Templeton has trading aggregation, allocation, and best execution policies and procedures that are designed to ensure that all trades are treated in an equitable and fiduciary manner relative to investment objectives. Where there is insufficient liquidity, the allocation policy automatically attributes liquidity proportionately across all client orders. The aggregation and allocation procedures are subject to a regular review.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interfund Trading and Franklin Templeton Funds Purchasing Franklin Templeton Funds.</strong> At times, Franklin Templeton may match internal orders of sales and purchases of portfolio securities. This is known as crosses or Interfunds. Some Franklin Templeton funds can also trade units in other Franklin Templeton funds. This process is dealt with in the existing trading system and procedures. The trade is executed at market price with no commissions or spread taken by Franklin Templeton. This activity is regularly reviewed with the goal of ensuring that clients are treated fairly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Research Material and Client Commissions.</strong> Franklin Templeton (FT) proprietary research material is not offered to the general public for sale. FT may enter into Client Commission Arrangements (CCAs), whereby FT directs trades to a broker-dealer with the instruction that the executing broker segregate commission in excess of execution costs in a pool which may be used to compensate brokers and other third parties that provide research services or products to FT. FT has established policies and standards that include ongoing monitoring, oversight, and audit controls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Use of Sensitive Data and Non-Public Information.</strong> Franklin Templeton has a number of policies and procedures in place that place restrictions on staff use of confidential or non-public information. There are formal reporting and approval procedures to release such information to satisfy Franklin Templeton’s fiduciary obligations to clients and shareholders. These policies and procedures are regularly reviewed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Information Barrier among Investment Advisors and Broker-Dealer Relationships.</strong> With the goal of ensuring that sensitive decision information cannot be used to the disadvantage of another fund and that confidential information is not shared inappropriately, Franklin Templeton has Information Barrier Compliance Policy and Procedures in place that separate the physical and logistical investment information between different advisor groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Code of Ethics.</strong> All Franklin Templeton personnel are bound by a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct which requires staff to conduct themselves with ethics and integrity and to avoid a conflict, particularly where their personal interests (including family members) could interfere with the interests of the firm and/or the client. In addition, Franklin Templeton has a Personal Investments and Insider Trading Policy that requires pre-clearance of personal transactions, including those of the immediate family of staff members who have access to non-public information regarding securities transactions, securities recommendations, or portfolio holding of FT funds or client accounts. Personal transactions of such staff members are regularly monitored, and prescribed sanctions are issued in the event of a breach.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Equitable and Fair Treatment among Clients.</strong> At the heart of Franklin Templeton procedures is the requirement to treat clients fairly and equitably in line with the firm’s fiduciary obligations and investment objectives. This includes, but is not limited to, activity such as the allocation of fees and expenses, redemption in kind, and the lending of securities of a fund. Franklin Templeton procedures are regularly reviewed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Investment in Client Securities.</strong> At times, Franklin Templeton funds or investors will invest in the securities of a company for which Franklin Templeton serves as investment manager. Such investment decisions made by Franklin Templeton to invest in client securities are always guided by what is in the best interest of the relevant fund, account, or its investors. Investment decisions are regularly reviewed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gifts and Entertainment.</strong> Franklin Templeton has adopted strict guidelines regarding what gifts and business entertainment are acceptable. The policy is part of our Code of Ethics, any violation of which may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Side-by-Side Management.</strong> Franklin Templeton has implemented “Policies and Procedures for Side-By-Side Management of Registered Investment Companies and Investment Accounts” designed to address potential conflicts of interest that may arise when a portfolio manager or different portfolio managers within a single investment adviser or within a single investment group manage both U.S.-registered funds and other investment accounts or pooled vehicles for other advisory clients.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>Fund distributions, which will be automatically reinvested in additional shares, are generally taxable to you as ordinary income, capital gains or some combination of both. Investment company dividends paid to you from interest earned on certain U.S. government securities may be exempt from state and local taxation, subject in some states to minimum investment or reporting requirements that must be met by the Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>Dividend income:</strong> Income dividends are generally subject to tax at ordinary rates. Because the Fund invests primarily in debt securities, it is expected that none of the Fund’s income dividends will be qualified dividends subject to reduced rates of taxation to individuals. A return-of-capital distribution is generally not taxable but will reduce the cost basis of your shares, and will result in a higher capital gain or a lower capital loss when you later sell your shares.</p>\n<p><strong>Capital gains:</strong> Fund distributions of short-term capital gains are also subject to tax at ordinary rates. Because the Fund is a money market fund, it does not expect to realize and distribute any long-term capital gains on its investments.</p>\n<p><strong>Sales of Fund shares:</strong> Because the Fund seeks to maintain a $1.00 per share NAV, sales of its shares will not generally result in a taxable capital gain or loss for federal or state income tax purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Medicare tax:</strong> An additional 3.8% Medicare tax is imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received from the Fund and net gains from redemptions or other taxable dispositions of Fund shares) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent that such person’s “modified adjusted gross income” (in the case of an individual) or “adjusted gross income” (in the case of an estate or trust) exceeds a threshold amount. Any liability for this additional Medicare tax is reported on, and paid with, your federal income tax return.</p>\n<p><strong>Backup withholding:</strong> A shareholder may be subject to backup withholding on any distributions of income and capital gains if the shareholder has provided either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, has failed to certify that the shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or has not certified that the shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. State backup withholding may also apply.</p>\n<p><strong>State and local taxes:</strong> Distributions of ordinary income and capital gains, if any are generally subject to state and local taxes. However, distributions of ordinary income paid to individual shareholders from interest earned by the Fund on certain U.S. Government obligations may be exempt from state and local income taxation depending on the state. Shareholders should contact their tax advisors with respect to the state and local income tax consequences of investing in the Fund, including whether Fund dividends derived from interest on U.S. government obligations held by the Fund qualify for tax free treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-U.S. investors:</strong> Non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. withholding tax at 30% or a lower treaty rate on Fund dividends of ordinary income. Non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. estate tax on the value of their shares. They are subject to special U.S. tax certification requirements to avoid backup withholding, claim any exemptions from withholding and claim any treaty benefits. Exemptions from U.S. withholding tax are generally provided for capital gains realized on the sale of Fund shares, capital gain dividends paid by the Fund from net long-term capital gains, short-term capital gain dividends paid by the Fund from net short-term capital gains and interest-related dividends paid by the Fund from its qualified net interest income from U.S. sources. However, notwithstanding such exemptions from U.S. withholding tax at source, any such dividends and distributions of income and capital gains will be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24% if you fail to properly certify that you are not a U.S. person.</p>\n<p><strong>Other reporting and withholding requirements:</strong> Payments to a shareholder that is either a foreign financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity within the meaning of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) may be subject to a 30% withholding tax on income dividends paid by the Fund. The FATCA withholding tax generally can be avoided by such foreign entity if it provides the Fund, and in some cases, the IRS, information concerning the ownership of certain foreign financial accounts or other appropriate certifications or documentation concerning its status under FATCA. The Fund may be required to report certain shareholder account information to the IRS, non-U.S. taxing authorities or other parties to comply with FATCA.</p>\n<p><strong>Other tax information:</strong> This discussion of “Distributions and Taxes” is for general information only and is not tax advice. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding your particular circumstances, and about any federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences before making an investment in the Fund. Additional information about the tax consequences of investing in the Fund may be found in the SAI.</p>\n<p><strong>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

The Benji platform allows for the for the minting, burning, transferring, freezing and clawing back of Benji Tokens. The code is tested internally as well as audited by providers shared below. The platform has been demonstrated to the U.S. SEC, Luxembourg CSSF, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and the UK FCA on more than one occasion. The tokenization engine is multi-chain and the official transaction records are on-chain. The blockchain protocols Franklin Templeton supports are Stellar, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche and Ethereum. In addition, we are working on the deployment of Aptos, Solana and Base. Other networks are evaluated regularly and go through an assessment of suitability based on specific criteria. The current U.S. Fund is available to individual or institutional investors that purchase shares directly from the Fund through the Benji Mobile App (for retail investors) or Benji Institutional Web Portal (as applicable). Similar to traditional fund recordkeeping systems, all Fund and shareholder records in the blockchain-integrated system are under the full and complete control of the Fund’s transfer agent.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tWhat audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>Our smart contract code has been audited by Trail of Bits as of September 2023.

Currently in our Digital Asset Investment portfolios, we own several governance tokens including many of the top governance tokens by market cap.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tBeyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The BENJI Token provides SparkDAO and MakerDAO access to the first U.S. registered Fund whose transaction records live natively on public blockchains, which can enhance the DAO’s treasury transparency, diversification and liquidity through a stable, regulatory compliant product. Additionally, we are actively working on expanding both the features of the BENJI Token, such as self-custody through your preferred wallet provider, which is currently available for Institutional clients, and extending its functionality across additional blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>We envision numerous applications for the BENJI Token across both the digital asset ecosystem and traditional finance. We believe peer-to-peer transfers have the potential to enhance the corporate funding process, whether that’s through Venture Capital firms who want to fund new projects or existing portfolio companies through a yield-bearing asset, or even for DAOs like Spark who may want to give grant funding to their sub-DAOs or other projects building on their native chain. In addition, we believe the BENJI Token may be able to provide utility for payments or even as a settlement or collateral token, since holders can engage in peer-to-peer transfers between each other between networks for any purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tDoes the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund currently uses the Stellar network as the primary public blockchain and Fund investors will initially hold their wallets on the Stellar network. However, the Fund may also use other blockchain networks, including Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Ethereum, Solana, and Base for certain accounts upon request and subject to eligibility, although one or more of those other blockchain networks may not be available at certain times. Please stay tuned for additional network availability.</p>\n<p>Fund shares may be transferred in peer-to-peer transactions from one shareholder wallet to another shareholder wallet (or potential shareholder wallet) within any approved blockchain network or between any two approved blockchain networks. Shares of the Fund may be transferred using the Institutional Web Portal. A complete record of these transactions is viewable on the blockchain due to being recorded by the transfer agent’s blockchain-integrated recordkeeping system. Before transferring Fund shares, you (as the transferor) and the potential transferee must each have an active, permissioned (i.e., “whitelisted”) wallet registered with the Fund’s transfer agent on any approved blockchain network. You may use the Institutional Web Portal to authorize the transfer agent to transfer your shares to a transferee that you identify using the public key for the transferee’s wallet. There is no minimum number of shares required to process a transfer. The transfer agent is responsible for ensuring that the potential transferee in a peer-to-peer transaction has a permissioned wallet on an approved blockchain network.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although you may provide instructions to transfer Fund shares at any time, transfers are processed at the Fund’s next NAV calculation time after we receive your transfer request in proper form through the Institutional Web Portal.</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding the fact that the Fund processes peer-to-peer transfers after the next calculated NAV following the receipt of a transfer request in proper form, the Fund does not require that peer-to-peer transfers occur at NAV.</li>\n<li>A whitelisted investor must be aware of other whitelisted investors who are available to enter into peer-to-peer transfers and neither the Fund nor its transfer agent will play any role in connecting transferors and transferees.</li>\n<li>Peer-to-peer transfers do not constitute a public trading market and Fund shares will not be listed for trading on any such market, including a national securities exchange or an alternative trading system operating by a registered broker that is subject to Regulation ATS.</li>\n<li>To the extent investors engage in peer-to-peer transfers at a price other than NAV, such transfers may, in certain circumstances, have legal implications for those investors under the federal securities laws or otherwise.</li>\n<li>The transfer agent cannot ensure the reliability of any transfer of other assets negotiated in connection with peer-to-peer transfers other than transfers of Fund shares that a shareholder instructs the transfer agent to make.</li>\n<li>Blockchain network(s) on which a peer-to-peer transfer is recorded may impose transaction fees to validate the transaction on the network. These fees are typically paid in the native digital asset for the operation of the blockchain network and will be the responsibility of the investment manager or its affiliates; Fund investors will not be required to purchase any native digital asset to transact on the network.<br>\nYou should consult your own tax advisor regarding your particular circumstances, and about any federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences in connection with the transfer of Fund shares.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, the Franklin Templeton Digital Assets team offers a variety of digital asset investment strategies, from multi-coin portfolios to single asset ETFs or private vehicles. Our investment team can also build customized multi-coin portfolios based on an investor’s desired risk tolerance and investment goals. Our digital asset investment team is open to any conversations on our product offerings should there be interest from Spark or other SubDAOs of Maker.</p>\n<p>We have also mentioned that Franklin Templeton provides over 200+ investment strategies across a full range of vehicles and investment strategies. We are happy to facilitate connections for SparkDAO if there is interest in any of our traditional products.</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong> Due to posting limitations, we will follow up with the following Appendix Items over email.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.franklintempleton.com/tools-and-resources/lit-preview/29386/SINGLCLASS/franklin-on-chain-u-s-government-money-fund#prospectus\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund Prospectus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.franklintempleton.com/tools-and-resources/lit-preview/29386/SINGLCLASS/franklin-on-chain-u-s-government-money-fund#statement-of-additional-information\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund SAI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.franklinresources.com/governance/corporate-governance-documents\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Franklin Templeton Corporate Governance Documents</a></li>\n<li>Appendix 1 – <em>Say Hello to Benji</em></li>\n<li>Appendix 2 – <em>Franklin Advisers, Inc.

We initially supported the legacy Maker system through the Maker Risk Dashboard and Makerburn. Following the launch of SparkLend, we extended our support to Spark users through the Spark Risk Dashboard.</p>\n<p><strong>After more than a year of development, we are now excited to announce the launch of the Sky Risk &amp; Analytics Dashboard.</strong></p>\n<p>Sky Risk &amp; Analytics Dashboard is available on the following URL: <strong><a href=\"https://info.sky.money\">https://info.sky.money</a></strong></p>\n<p>The Sky Risk &amp; Analytics Dashboard was designed with two main goals in mind: providing a simple user experience while at the same time highlighting the resilience of the Sky Ecosystem. The motivation behind these design principles are based on the assumption that a protocol’s risk management is only as effective as its ability to clearly present risk metrics to protocol users, regardless of their knowledge or experience level. Our aim is for the Sky Risk &amp; Analytics Dashboard to become the new standard, where all Sky stakeholders can easily digest data regarding the most critical aspects of the Sky Protocol and broader Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Below, we highlight some of the key features that make the new dashboard an important tool for Sky Ecosystem participants.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-99004-homepage-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-99004-homepage-2\"></a>Homepage</h1>\n<p>The Sky Risk &amp; Analytics Dashboard homepage is intended to provide insights into the holistic performance of the Sky Ecosystem.

Product type / underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>$M is a permissionless, immutable cryptodollar (currently) exclusively backed by short term t-bills (0-90 day maturity). The M^0 protocol is capable of passing protocol yield to governance-approved parties, as a function of the underlying collateral yield and governance parameter, currently at a rate of 5% APY. While this rate should roughly track the yield on the collateral portfolio, the M^0 protocol allows governance to express monetary policy in ways similar to Maker, while protecting the $M’s overcollateralization.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Issuer jurisdiction</strong></p>\n<p>Like USDS and DAI, the same $M can be issued by several parties and should thus be considered a multi-issuer cryptodollar. Actors called “Minters” are able to deposit collateral into specially purposed structures (SPVs) that are designed exclusively to serve the protocol, and for which Minters must provide evidence to governance. Minters can then bring this balance on-chain with the assistance of one or more “Validators.” One of our first Validators is <a href=\"https://chroniclelabs.org/blog/m-0-and-chronicle-raising-the-standard-in-collateral-verification-with-the-rwa-oracle\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chronicle Labs</a>, the team that has been powering Maker’s (and now Sky’s) oracles since the project’s inception. Once the collateral balance is on-chain, the Minter can generate up to a certain percentage of its value in $M. Minters accrue interest on the collateral balance, and pay a fee to the protocol (the Minter Rate). The vast majority of those proceeds are passed by the protocol to eligible Earners.</p>\n<p>The first Minter (issuer) in the M^0 ecosystem is <a href=\"https://www.mxon.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">MXON</a>, an entity operating in the British Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>5.

Company Details</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Company description</strong></p>\n<p>M^0 is not a traditional company, but a decentralized protocol like Sky. The protocol was built by M^0 Labs (The Thing GmbH), which is based in Berlin, Germany. Since the protocol is immutable, M^0 Labs, the M^0 Foundation (Switzerland), and any other affiliated entity, no longer has the ability to upgrade or control the protocol. Token holders, which include founders, team members, and investors (see <a href=\"http://www.m0.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">www.m0.org</a> for our list of investors) control a limited set of parameters in the protocol through the governance process. In M^0 governance, all token holders are required to participate or else lose 10% of their voting power per missed vote, providing a high likelihood that proposals are exposed and voted on by the entire set of governors. The primary function of governance in M^0 is to approve Minters, Validators, Earners, and updates to the Adopted Guidance.

Product Information</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p>M^0 is a decentralized protocol, as well as a set of off-chain standards and APIs, that allows institutional holders of high-quality collateral to issue fungible cryptodollars (“stablecoins”). As in the Sky protocol, everything in the M^0 protocol must be achieved through decentralized governance. We designed a custom governance mechanism which over time enforces 100% participation from all token holders and requires total transparency for even the slightest alteration – nothing is outsourced to centralized parties. Our protocol’s smart contracts are completely immutable and cannot be upgraded through governance. Our protocol was audited 8 times by some of the best names in the business, including Prototech, who wrote many of the smart contracts that Maker has been using for years. We are confident that M^0 is the only safe and credibly neutral solution to Sky’s needs.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>$M is a permissionless, immutable cryptodollar that combines the benefits of digital dollars with the risk profile of physical cash. Backed by Eligible Collateral, currently short-term U.S. Treasury bills held in insolvency-remote, orphaned SPVs, $M is issued through a permissionless and immutable protocol, ensuring daily auditable reserves. M^0’s overcollateralized model not only secures the value of $M but also allows institutional partners to earn yield natively, without additional smart contract risk. $M is currently paying 5% to these Earners, making it an attractive option for on-chain treasuries seeking secure and transparent returns .</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>There are two options for yield accrual - rebasing, which is the native way to accrue yield on $M, or claiming via our wrapper contract, Smart $M. Rebasing occurs continuously while claiming via the wrapper is triggered manually or upon transfers.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>The first issuer in the M^0 ecosystem is MXON. The company is based out of the British Virgin Islands. The key entities are “Minter One Ltd.” and “Minter One Generator (SPV) Ltd” Currently, the shareholders of M^0 Labs and MXON are very similar as MXON was created to help bootstrap the network. Furthermore, the collateral is held in a Luxembourg, orphaned, bankruptcy-remote SPV incorporated as “Asset Repository Sàrl”.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>At this current time, according to the governance-approved Adopted Guidance, only short term (&lt;90 day residual maturity) US t-bills are considered Eligible Collateral. No bank deposits whatsoever are counted towards Minter collateralization. Eligible Collateral is tested on a near-daily basis to ensure continued eligibility.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>7.

What is the AUM of the product? Provide a breakdown by blockchain</strong></p>\n<p>Ethereum Mainnet - 42,734,580 $M</p>\n<p>Eligible Collateral (off-chain) - $ 54,000,000</p>\n<p>This initial TVL/AUM is the result of a few months of efforts. We anticipate significant increases, based on existing agreements, across several blockchain ecosystems in the coming months.</p>\n<p><strong>9. What are the standard fees (i.e., subscription, redemption, management, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>Minters in the M^0 network will compete on purchase/sale fee structure. The current fee for purchasing or selling through MXON is $0. Once on-chain, $M is tradable in a 1 bps UniV3 market with PSM-style (i.e. 1-tick) liquidity. Our liquidity partners will periodically rebalance this pool by purchasing or selling directly with MXON (and potentially other Minters), to ensure Sky and other users have sufficient on-chain liquidity for their needs.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Other than the fees described above, can other expenses be paid from the proceeds of the product/assets?</strong></p>\n<p>M^0 is structured similarly to MakerDAO v1 – a user (Minter) comes to the protocol with collateral (US t-bills) that they anticipate will increase in value. They generate a credit line against this collateral ($M) and pay interest (the Minter Rate) on that credit line. The Minter keeps (or loses) the spread between what they are earning in collateral appreciation and the Minter Rate.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Minter Rate is slotted to be set to 4.8% and the collateral has an average yield of 5.10%, leaving a levered (by the Mint Ratio which is currently 95%, and in the process of changing to 97%) 30 bps spread for the Minter to cover its own expenses. This level of spread ceases to be loss generating and is sustainable at approximately $300M+ in AUM. We anticipate for the fixed and variable costs of operating a Minter/SPV combination to compress substantially over the coming years and therefore for breakeven Minter AUM to compress significantly as well.</p>\n<p><strong>11. How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></p>\n<p>$M as a native asset is entirely permissionless and immutable. In order to become a Minter, Validator, or Earner, the entity must submit an application and be approved by the on-chain governance process. All off-chain entities must be approved by the rules in the Adopted Guidance, which requires governance approval to amend.</p>\n<p><strong>12. What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>N/A - On-chain liquidity for $M was only launched this week. We anticipate this volume to grow significantly.</p>\n<p>There is a Uniswap v3 Pool being managed by our liquidity partners which should soon hold approximately $20M of liquidity in $M and $USDC. We plan to support the growth of this and other liquidity facilities.</p>\n<p><strong>13. What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>We estimate that current Minters will require a maximum of 5 days to purchase/sell $M, mainly due to bank holidays abutting a weekend. In the normal course of business, purchasing or selling $M should not take longer than 3 business days, as the t-bill collateral must be sold and the transaction and wire transfers cleared. We have not had any interruptions to date. As mentioned above, we anticipate that Sky will never need to integrate directly with Minters and will be able to exclusively use on-chain liquidity facilities to enter/exit $M.</p>\n<p><strong>14. Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>For $M holders who do not wish to utilize secondary markets or OTC desks, direct purchase or sale requests can be made with Minters, assuming they are qualified entities and not based in a restricted jurisdiction such as the USA. The transaction requires KYC/AML checks with the BD Minter and potentially with the Corporate Service Provider. This process may take up to a week once all documentation has been received. Again, it is not anticipated that Sky, being a crypto-native organization, will need to interface with real-world entities and should be able to exercise its needs via on-chain liquidity facilities.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/9/49cc467355a64931c7b7f01caf4a62f19fa68b2b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/awQvNIHcTvll6ZWzn3tSwVSKvAD.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/9/49cc467355a64931c7b7f01caf4a62f19fa68b2b_2_607x324.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"awQvNIHcTvll6ZWzn3tSwVSKvAD\" width=\"607\" height=\"324\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/9/49cc467355a64931c7b7f01caf4a62f19fa68b2b_2_607x324.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/9/49cc467355a64931c7b7f01caf4a62f19fa68b2b_2_910x486.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/9/49cc467355a64931c7b7f01caf4a62f19fa68b2b_2_1214x648.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DEEEFA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>15.

What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Each Minter is overseen in their respective jurisdiction(s). The first issuer, MXON, is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and therefore falls under this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>All collateral which backs $M must be demonstrably, continuously held in orphaned, insolvency remote, special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Specifically, all SPVs in the M^0 ecosystem must meet the following criteria, which is taken from our most recent governance-approved Adopted Guidance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is an orphaned entity;</li>\n<li>is minimally affiliated (via its shareholders) with or (practically) controlled by any Validator or Minter or the affiliates of any Validator or Minter;</li>\n<li>does not conduct any other business except the storage of collateral for Minters and issuance of Notes to Minters;</li>\n<li>is a restricted-purpose vehicle that prevents entering into any other liabilities but the ones directly related to the storage of collateral and the issuance of Notes against such collateral;</li>\n<li>is designed to be insolvency remote;</li>\n<li>is incorporated in an Approved Jurisdiction, as described below;</li>\n<li>possesses all required licenses and permissions (if necessary) to store collateral and to issue Notes against such collateral;</li>\n<li>is audited on an annual basis by a licensed auditor deemed appropriate to perform the task.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, any Notes issued to the Minter shall comply with the following in order to be considered Eligible Collateral:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full asset segregation of collateral not only at the Minter level, but also at the level of each wallet address controlled by the Minter — in case the Minter controls more than one permissioned address.</li>\n<li>Limited recourse so that the claims of any Minter are strictly limited to the collateral belonging to its Notes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently the only Approved Jurisdiction is Luxembourg, but this list is expected to grow to other high quality jurisdictions as the list of approved Minters grows. Candidates for Approved Jurisdictions shall comply with the following minimum requirements (again taken from the Adopted Guidance):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bankruptcy Remoteness - The jurisdiction provides legal and structural mechanisms that reduce the risk of insolvency for the legal entity, reinforcing the effectiveness of provisions that prevent creditors and investors from initiating insolvency proceedings against the legal entity or seizing its assets or the assets of its compartments, estates or sub-funds.</li>\n<li>Non-Petition and Non-Seizure Provisions - Jurisdictions must uphold provisions that prevent creditors and investors from initiating insolvency proceedings against a legal entity or seizing its assets or the assets of its compartments or estates or sub-funds, thus ensuring the legal entity’s bankruptcy remoteness.</li>\n<li>Priority of Payments and Subordination - The legal system recognises and enforces contractual or statutory arrangements that clearly define the priority of payments and the subordination of claims among investors and creditors.</li>\n<li>Regulatory Compliance - The jurisdiction has a regulatory framework that supports the business activities of the legal entity, including clear guidelines for the trading of financial instruments and Eligible Collateral associated with them.</li>\n<li>Legal and Regulatory Framework - The jurisdiction has a legal and regulatory framework that permits the issuance of financial instruments and the investment in Eligible Collateral.</li>\n<li>Political Stability - The jurisdiction exhibits a high degree of political stability, characterized by a consistent and predictable legal and regulatory environment, minimal political unrest, and an upholding of the rule of law.</li>\n<li>Dispute Resolution - An effective legal framework for dispute resolution is in place, including access to courts or arbitration panels.</li>\n<li>Asset Segregation - Collateral for each Minter is either to be stored in a separate legal entity per Minter or the jurisdiction must provide legal frameworks that enable the establishment of separate compartments or estates or sub-funds within a single legal entity, ensuring that each compartment or estate or sub-fund is its own distinct pool of assets and liabilities. There must be clear legal recognition that assets within one compartment or estate or sub-fund are exclusively reserved for the investors and creditors of that compartment or estate or sub-fund and are protected from the claims of creditors of other compartments or estates or sub-funds and claims of creditors of the legal entity to ensure the functioning of the intended wind down processes, as described below.</li>\n<li>Limited Recourse- The legal system must enforce that the claims of investors and creditors are strictly limited to the assets of the compartment or estate or sub-fund to which they have exposure. In cases where the assets of a compartment or estate or sub-fund are insufficient to satisfy the claims, the legal framework permits the extinguishment of any remaining claims, prohibiting further recovery efforts.</li>\n<li>Investor Protection - There are robust mechanisms in place to protect investors, including clear disclosure requirements and the enforcement of fiduciary duties by the managers of the legal entity.</li>\n<li>Operational Infrastructure - The jurisdiction boasts a developed financial infrastructure capable of supporting complex financial transactions, including experienced service providers and legal counsel with expertise in financial matters.</li>\n<li>Custody Relationship - The jurisdiction recognises and enforces the legal nature of the custody relationship between the legal entity and its custodian, ensuring that assets held in custody are protected and segregated from the custodian’s general estate in the event of its bankruptcy.</li>\n<li>Audit - The jurisdiction requires the mandatory (by law) audit of the annual financial statements of the legal entity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5.

Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p>Approximately once per day (30 hours) every Minter with an active balance of Owed $M must submit a proof of reserve. Failure to post this proof on-chain results in a Penalty Rate being charged on their balance of Owed $M. They achieve this by calling the updateCollateral() method in the M^0 smart contracts and providing the current USD value of the Eligible Collateral in their associated SPV. However, they cannot submit this transaction on-chain without a governance-provided quorum of Validator signatures. Validators are written into the bank and custodial accounts of the SPV and are attesting that the USD value of the Eligible Collateral is identical to what the Minter has provided. M^0 is by far the most transparent and provides the most frequent updates compared to any peer in the industry.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product</strong></p>\n<p>Each day, the Minter must put the USD value of the Eligible Collateral on-chain using current market prices for the collateral. From here, they can only mint the Mint Ratio (currently 95% but proposed to become 97%) against the balance of the Eligible Collateral as $M.</p>\n<p>The SPV holding the collateral is reviewed daily by all Validators associated with the Minter, a review for which Validators provide on-chain signature verification and will soon provide live information at the individual asset level, and undergoes an annual audit by a professional audit firm.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p>Lift Dollar (USDL) is a regulated yield-bearing ERC-20 stablecoin issued by Paxos International and overseen by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). USDL distributes the yield generated on reserve assets directly to token holders on a daily basis. This is achieved through a rebasing mechanism that increases the circulating supply by the rate of daily distributed interest without any action needed from token holders. Currently USDL is only issued on Ethereum but we plan to issue USDL on additional blockchains this year.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>Lift Dollar (USDL) reserve assets are held in cash and equivalents in the below categories, as required by our regulator:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cash deposits residing in a bank deposit account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>US Government Securities with three-month or less residual maturity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overnight reverse repurchase agreements overcollateralized by US Government Securities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>US Government Money Market Funds</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the token holder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>USDL is an ERC-20 token, with the USDL smart contract distributing yield daily through a rebasing mechanism. Rebasing was chosen as an efficient, scalable approach for distributing yield. Yield is generated from the token’s reserves that are invested in cash and cash equivalent assets. Every day around 8:30 am EST, token holders’ USDL balance increases as a result of rebasing.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>Abu Dhabi Global Markets</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>USDL cannot be held by US institutions or individuals. There are no additional restrictions toward asset eligibility.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the use of hedging or derivatives is not permitted by our regulator. Lift Dollar (USDL) reserve assets are held in cash and equivalents in the below categories, as required by our regulator:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cash deposits residing in a bank deposit account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>US Government Securities with three-month or less residual maturity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overnight reverse repurchase agreements overcollateralized by US Government Securities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>US Government Money Market Funds</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>7.

Legal Structure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong></p>\n<p>The USDL token is centrally minted and burned by Paxos International, licensed and regulated by the FSRA to conduct the Regulated Activity of “Providing Money Services” in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). The FSRA has granted Paxos Issuance MENA Ltd. (doing business as Paxos International) a Financial Services Permission for the provision of Money Services (FSP) to conduct the FSRA-regulated activity of providing money services in and from the ADGM. Under FSRA rules, stablecoins are treated as a “mechanism for storing value” similar to e-money. USDL meets the FSRA criteria to be deemed an Accepted Virtual Asset following the FSRA assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International is regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International has approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market to issue U.S. dollar and other currency backed stablecoins.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International holds all reserve assets segregated and bankruptcy protected with permitted custodians for the benefit of token holders, in accordance with COBS pursuant to the FSRA framework for Fiat-Referenced Tokens (FRTs). All reserve assets are held by Paxos International for the benefit of the token holders and cannot be used by Paxos International’s general creditors in the event of an insolvency of Paxos International or any of its affiliates.</p>\n<p>The Paxos International reserve management approach includes the following safeguards for all assets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The mint and burn operation requires the requisite amount of US dollars in the USDL reserve account before Paxos International mints USDL.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paxos International employs a robust intraday liquidity management program to assess cash balances and asset custody across all banking and custodial relationships.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reserve assets may be held in one or more of the following categories, as required by the FSRA:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Cash, residing in segregated bank deposit accounts held for the benefit of USDL holders.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Cash equivalents and debt securities issued by the U.S. Government or organizations that are of both a government and international character with a minimum credit rating of “AA-” with up to three (month) residual maturity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Institutional stable NAV USD government money-market funds, domiciled in non-US jurisdictions with weighted average maturities (WAMs) of no greater than 60 days and weighted average lives (WALs) of no greater than 120 days, subject to FSRA-approved limits on the value of reserve assets to be held in such funds and FSRA-approved credit ratings of such funds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Reverse repurchase agreements overcollateralized by debt securities issued by U.S. Government with maturities of one business day, with a counterparty that is not Paxos International affiliated and adequately creditworthy (as defined by the FSRA credit rating requirements).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eligible reserve assets may be acquired and managed directly by the Paxos International treasury and portfolio management team or indirectly through third-party investment managers in the form of separately managed accounts (SMAs).</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Pursuant to FSRA requirements, in the event of Paxos International’s insolvency or another triggering event as defined by the FSRA, the USDL reserves are required to be liquidated and distributed on a first priority basis to all USDL holders on a pro rata basis up to the amount of USDL outstanding on a 1:1 basis to US dollars. Such funds (up to the USDL outstanding amount) are not permitted to be paid to any other party including any creditor of Paxos International, nor is any USDL holder entitled to any additional yield in such an event.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No, Paxos International does not have any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>To our knowledge, Paxos International or the USDL product does not have any identified conflicts of interest with MakerDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International recommends consulting with a tax advisor regarding the potential tax implications associated with USDL.</p>\n<p><strong>V. Performance, Reporting, and Technical</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Provide historical performance relative to the most relevant benchmark and explanations for any deviations from the benchmark</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International believes that the relevant benchmark for USDL would be the risk-free rate for the US Dollar. The general market consensus is that the risk-free rate for the US Dollar is a zero-coupon US Treasury security, i.e., a one year (52-week) US Treasury Bill. This can be independently obtained via TreasuryDirect at <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/auction-query/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/auction-query/</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the launch of USDL, the APY on USDL has closely approximated the risk-free rate given the composition of the underlying reserves.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International has engaged Crowe MAK, a global audit, tax, advisory and risk firm to perform the monthly examination of USDL’s reserves in accordance with guidelines as set forth by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (“FSRA”) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (“ADGM”). Reports are issued monthly and posted to <a href=\"http://www.liftdollar.com/transparency\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lift Dollar (USDL) - Access Restricted</a>.</p>\n<p>Since inception, USDL’s APY has approximated 5%.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos International has engaged Crowe MAK, a global audit, tax, advisory and risk firm to perform the monthly examination of USDL’s reserves in accordance with guidelines as set forth by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (“FSRA”) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (“ADGM”). Crowe is an independent-third party with both the knowledge and experience to perform the examination engagement.</p>\n<p>As part of Crowe’s monthly examinations, they ensure that the fair value and the amortized cost of the reserve assets is at equal to or greater than the total outstanding market capitalization of USDL at the time of the examination. Crowe’s examinations are performed in accordance with the standards set forth by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p>The USDL token is deployed on the Ethereum network and is centrally minted/burned by Paxos International. USDL and the associated smart contract provide yield through a daily rebasing mechanism. Rebasing is a technique used to adjust the supply of a token. The USDL smart contract uses rebasing, through a smart-contract multiplier, to distribute yield to eligible token holders. All eligible token balances increase based on the multiplier value.</p>\n<p>Deploying this smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain enables transparent and programmatic yield distribution. It also allows yield to be distributed to a large number of wallets regardless of the amount being distributed. Rebasing occurs at a set interval, for example, at the same time every day. Eligible token holders see their balance increase as a result of rebasing at these set time intervals. USDL is configured to rebase daily at launch, though this frequency could change in the future to address customer needs.</p>\n<p>For more information on the USDL technical implementation, please see our white paper at <a href=\"https://whitepaper.liftdollar.com/index.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://whitepaper.liftdollar.com/index.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>5. What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>The USDL smart contract is audited by both Certik and Trail of Bits to ensure that the code is sound and operates as intended. The most recent audits were completed in Q1 2024. Audits are publicly viewable on github <a href=\"https://github.com/paxosglobal/ybs-contract/tree/master/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/paxosglobal/ybs-contract/tree/master/audits</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>Paxos has previously worked on direct listings with platforms such Aave and Compound, as well as incentive programs with MakerDAO PSM.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The SparkDAO/MakerDAO allocation to USDL will help give these ecosystems direct access to competitive yield in a transparent and conservative manner. Due to USDL’s prudential oversight by the FSRA, USDL’s stablecoin reserves may only be held in the most secure and liquid assets which include cash deposits at regulated financial institutions, short-term US Government Securities and US Government Money Market Funds. Further, USDL’s reserves will be examined monthly by an independent third-party to ensure that USDL is adequately reserves. The results of this examination will be published monthly by Paxos International.</p>\n<p>In addition to tokenized assets such as USDL, onboarding to Paxos International will give SparkDAO/MakerDAO access to Paxos’ asset orchestration platform. This enables the seamless movement between stablecoins (including USDL, PYUSD, USDC, USDP, and USDT).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>USDL is relatively new but we plan to introduce integrations on platforms such as Morpho and Aave in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to USDL, Paxos is also the issuer of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>PAXG, a regulated tokenized gold product. With a market capitalization of ~$500M.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PYUSD, PayPal’s regulated stablecoin. Current market capitalization of $850M.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>We can offer a revenue share on the amount of PYUSD adopted by SparkDAO</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>USDP, Paxos’ original regulated stablecoin. Current market capitalization of $105M.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>We can offer a revenue share on the amount of USDP adopted by SparkDAO</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Paxos is open to partnerships and potential revenue sharing opportunities on these products as well. We also expect to tokenize other assets as the leading regulated tokenization for platforms like Paypal, and can explore future opportunities when they arise.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-paxos-international-usdl/25117\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-paxos-international-usdl/25117","pubDate":"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 22:03:44 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25117"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-paxos-international-usdl/25117.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Paxos International USDL"},"filter":false},{"title":"First Wave Integrator Program - FAQ","dc:creator":"Viridian","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Following on from the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/first-wave-integrator-program/24784\">First Wave Integrator Program</a> introductory post, this guide has been created by Viridian Advisors to assist applicants in understanding the details of the Accessibility Reward system.

Viridian Advisors acts as the Accessibility Reward Codes operator.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Who is eligible to apply ?</strong></p>\n<p>As Viridian Advisors, we are open to projects across the ecosystem including segments such as L1’s, L2’s, Wallets, Exchanges, dApps, and Consumer applications.</p>\n<p>Note that the final decisions regarding availability will be made by Sky Ecosystem Governance. The First Wave Integrator Program is in its early phases, and its rules will develop and become more comprehensive over time. We encourage applicants to contact us but note that eligibility and geographical restrictions will apply.</p>\n<p><strong>3) What’s the application process?</strong></p>\n<p>Applications should be made via the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/first-wave-integrator-program/24784\">First Wave Integrator Program</a> post in the Sky Ecosystem Governance forum or directly via the following <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScg-RZPJMy4hJI8f42Vsvqn947Ls9ZfNH5idLnCa2AyDnmy4g/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">google form</a>.</p>\n<p>All applications will be reviewed by Viridian Advisors on their individual merits against the program selection criteria and for those projects being considered for inclusion, the listed contact in the application process will be contacted by us to coordinate next steps. As noted above, final decisions regarding eligibility and participation in the program will be made by Sky Ecosystem Governance in a discretionary manner.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Will there be other Sky integrator programs beyond the First Wave program ?</strong></p>\n<p>It is expected that over time, the Sky Integrator Program will encompass more than just the First Wave Program. The final decisions in this respect belong to Sky Ecosystem Governance.</p>\n<p>As such, non-inclusion in the First Wave Integrator Program by Viridian Advisors does not exclude potential future inclusion in a Sky integrator program and future access to Accessibility Rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>5) What are the main rules ?</strong></p>\n<p>Integrators included in the program will be issued an Accessibility Reward Code, which will allow them to earn Accessibility Rewards on USDS balances that access the Sky protocol via the Integrator front ends or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The accessibility rewards are specified and maintained updated within the <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5.2_Accessibility_Reward-553ee681-dba2-4e2e-8bb8-2fc606989e88%7C8d5a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Accessibility Scope of the Atlas v2</a> ,</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the latest Sky Ecosystem Governance proposal update, Integrators earn a 0.4% annual adoption-based incentive on USDS balances held in the Sky Savings Rate or Sky Token Rewards features of the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<p>For USDS balances outside of the Sky Savings Rate or Sky Token Rewards, Integrators earn an annual adoption-based incentive fee equal to [Sky Savings Rate - 0.2%].</p>\n<p><strong>6) How are integrators selected ?</strong></p>\n<p>Projects will be initially reviewed by Viridian Advisors against criteria, including having an active and live product, community reach, segment focus and strategic alignment with the Sky money ecosystem.</p>\n<p>As Viridian Advisors, we will prioritize those Integrators who demonstrate commitment and the agility to integrate USDS in a timely manner following launch.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Are there any ongoing operational requirements for integrators ?</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5.2_Accessibility_Reward-553ee681-dba2-4e2e-8bb8-2fc606989e88%7C8d5a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Accessibility Scope of the Atlas v2</a>., governs accessibility efforts, including the Accessibility Reward system, and integrators should stay abreast of updates implemented by Sky Ecosystem Governance to this scope.</p>\n<p><strong>8) Are there any geographical or other restrictions for integrators ?</strong></p>\n<p>As a decentralized and permissionless protocol, the Sky Protocol itself, including the contracts for its native stablecoin, USDS, and native governance token, SKY, have no inherent jurisdictional restrictions.</p>\n<p>Integrator interfaces that serve as gateways to the Sky Protocol may implement access restrictions in light of any applicable regulatory considerations. However, these restrictions are specific to those interfaces and do not reflect any jurisdictional restrictions imposed by the Sky Protocol itself as the Sky Protocol is permissionless software that can be accessed via the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5.5_Location_Resilience-d788d60f-be4b-4b93-aa08-d3935081c8e4%7C8d5a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">location resilience article</a> within the Accessibility Scope defines the location-filtering rules applicable for integrator frontends that receive Accessibility Rewards. Any infringement to the restrictions in this article may result in the loss of access to Accessibility Rewards.</p>\n<p>While we expect the Atlas rules regarding Accessibility Rewards to be elaborated in the future, as Viridian Advisors, we will aim to accept participants who comply with the rules and requirements as specified in the Atlas. Participants based out of or serving customers in highly regulated or regulatorily uncertain countries will likely be excluded from participation. Feel free to clarify your regulatory position when applying to the program.</p>\n<p><strong>9) What are the technical integration requirements of the program ?</strong></p>\n<p>Integrators will need to support USDS via their front end or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>At least one of the USDS features of the Sky Protocol , i.e., USDS Unrewarded, USDS Savings or USDS Token Rewards will need to be integrated to qualify for receiving Accessibility Rewards.</p>\n<p>First Wave Program Integrators will be issued an Accessibility Reward Code, which will allow them to tag USDS balances and user transactions that access the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>10) What technical support is available for integration efforts ?</strong></p>\n<p>The technical developer documentation, available at <a href=\"https://docs.sky.money/developers/yFbKYQfnTPVv36vJZ3OK\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.sky.money/developers/yFbKYQfnTPVv36vJZ3OK</a> should be the first port of call.</p>\n<p>Additionally, for First Wave Program members, on a best effort basis, technical support can be provided by relevant Sky Ecosystem Actors.</p>\n<p><strong>11) What data (e.g., addresses, reports, metrics) needs to be tracked/provided ?</strong></p>\n<p>All Integrators should provide an Ethereum address for receiving their Accessibility Reward.</p>\n<p>In cases where custodial addresses exist for USDS and/or sUSDS balances, they should be provided.</p>\n<p>Transactions calling the relevant contracts of the Sky Protocol for USDS Savings and for USDS Token Rewards should be tagged with the Accessibility Reward Code issued to the Integrator.</p>\n<p>Where on-chain monitoring is not viable, off-chain reports / metrics may be requested, such as aggregated user balances for USDS.</p>\n<p>At the time of issuance of the Accessibility Reward Code, the exact data to be provided for monitoring purposes will be reviewed and confirmed with each integrator.</p>\n<p><strong>12) How are transactions tagged with the Accessibility Reward Code ?</strong></p>\n<p>Integrators should tag USDS Savings and USDS Token Rewards Transactions with their unique Accessibility Reward Code as per the following links;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>USDS Savings contract ( <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sdai/blob/7014ce105f88f1d0b1ff2c190c135342e0d7da8d/src/SUsds.sol#L352\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a> )</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>USDS Token Rewards contract ( <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/endgame-toolkit/blob/1e419c6d0a4287ff6d04c7c7cc68bfa6442d076f/src/synthetix/StakingRewards.sol#L110\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a> )</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>13) Is the First Wave Program available Multichain (i.e., beyond Ethereum Mainnet) ?</strong></p>\n<p>Initially the First Wave Program will only launch on mainnet, and accessibility rewards for USDS on other domains can only be credited to the Reward Code holder of any qualifying bridge contract.</p>\n<p>Once Skylink launches and supports other domains, starting with L2’s, Accessibility Rewards will be available directly for L2 and other domain integrators, since Skylink infra will facilitate the tracking of individual integrator activity on other domains.</p>\n<p><strong>14) How long is the process to be approved for the program ?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no defined or limiting timeframes, neither for application nor for processing, although best efforts will be made to respond to all applicants in a timely manner and for the processing of Accessibility Reward Codes.</p>\n<p>The program should be considered as ongoing and continuous and also subject to change over time via Sky Ecosystem Governance updates to the <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5_The_Accessibility_Scope-9e3f76e6-3343-4e70-af0b-c914be2e8d5a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Accessibility Scope</a> in the Atlas.</p>\n<p><strong>15) How are accessibility rewards calculated and received ?</strong></p>\n<p>Accessibility rewards are calculated on a monthly basis based on the rates defined within the <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5.2_Accessibility_Reward-553ee681-dba2-4e2e-8bb8-2fc606989e88%7C8d5a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Accessibility Scope of the Atlas v2</a> ;</p>\n<p>Rewards will be calculated and published by Viridian Advisors using available on chain data of USDS and/or sUSDS balances , as well as Accessibility Reward Code tagged transactions. Where applicable off-chain reports and data may also be used.</p>\n<p>Integrator rewards will be disbursed by the Accessibility Scope Facilitator to the Ethereum wallet corresponding to the registered Integrator, subject to approval from Sky Ecosystem Governance.</p>\n<p>Note that the rules are subject to change as the program evolves. Any detected unwanted behavior to misuse the program may cause exclusion from the program without notice, or refusal to pay out the rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>16) Can an Accessibility Reward Code be pre-issued to facilitate integration efforts prior to inclusion in the program?</strong></p>\n<p>In some cases, where inclusion in the First Wave Program may be delayed, an accessibility reward code may be pre-issued to allow integrators to proceed with their integration efforts and so allow for the retroactive calculation of Accessibility Rewards when and if inclusion in the program is eventually approved.</p>\n<p>In such cases, the issuance of an Accessibility Reward Code should not be interpreted as an inclusion to receive Accessibility Rewards, which will only be disbursed following approval into the program and based on the Participant lists published on the Sky Ecosystem Governance forum.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/first-wave-integrator-program-faq/25115\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/first-wave-integrator-program-faq/25115","pubDate":"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 06:04:01 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25115"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/first-wave-integrator-program-faq/25115.rss","#text":"First Wave Integrator Program - FAQ"},"filter":false},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - Cogito Finance TFUND","dc:creator":"Kenneth246","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<p><strong>I.

The Company is registered with CIMA pursuant to section 4(3) of the Mutual Funds Act.</p>\n<p>The SPC is a separate legal entity and fully bankruptcy-remote from the remaining Cogito legal structure.</p>\n<p>Per Cayman regulations, please also note that TFUND is not available to investors from the following jurisdictions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OFAC Sanctions List</li>\n<li>United States</li>\n<li>The People’s Republic of China</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>The regulatory body that oversees TFUND is the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA)</p>\n<p><strong>What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Cogito holds a mutual fund license from CIMA and is not required to have a VASP license.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cogito-finance_tokenization-activity-7150474249059606529-KvYE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Announcement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/cogito-shakes-the-market-with-groundbreaking-rwa-ai-financial-products\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cointelegraph</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness</strong></p>\n<p>TFUND is issued under a Cayman Segregated Portfolio Company (Ergo Sum SPC), regulated by CIMA. A Segregated Portfolio company can create several segregated portfolios which legally separate the assets and liabilities from each other, therefore protecting assets from liabilities of other portfolios.</p>\n<p>At this stage, Ergo Sum SPC only manages one segregated portfolio, TFUND (Treasury SP). Any new products launched by Cogito would be offered through a separate segregated portfolio.</p>\n<p>Ergo Sum SPC is a standalone legal entity which is separate from Cogito’s legal structure and therefore, bankruptcy remote.</p>\n<p><strong>What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></p>\n<p>As a licensed product under CIMA, TFUND tokenholders have voluntary redemption and repurchase rights. TFUND tokens can be redeemed for USDC, or USDT through the Cogito platform.</p>\n<p>Investors are required to sign a subscription agreement prior to their purchase of TFUND. This document is accessible through Cogito’s onboarding process and contractual rights outlined in the agreement are applicable to all parties.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>None</p>\n<p><strong>Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>None</p>\n<p><strong>Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>There is no tax imposed on returns of the TFUND as it is registered in the Cayman Islands.

Whitelisted addresses are stored onchain in a separate smart contract that can be updated independently of the fund contract. Token transfers may only occur to and from whitelisted addresses.</p>\n<p>Subscription and redemption requests are made to the vault contract. Once the investor completes the offchain processes, the Cogito team will approve the investor’s subscription or redemption transaction and transfer stablecoins to or from the vault contract. For compliance purposes, the Cogito team is able to mint, burn, and transfer investor tokens according to the terms of the PPM.</p>\n<p>Token holders earn a return by holding TFUND, where the token price is expected to increase in value over time. That change in token price directly reflects the returns generated by the underlying portfolio held by the Fund.</p>\n<p>The TFUND token price is calculated as the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per token. The token price can be derived by dividing the NAV of the Fund by the total outstanding supply of TFUND. The TFUND token price was launched with a default value of 1.00.</p>\n<p>The TFUND Vault will use multisig and require multiple private keys, including the Fund’s independent third-party fund manager to authorize and sign off on transactions involving onchain assets. The use of on-ramp and off-ramp services will also be limited to authorized representatives from the Cogito team via multisig operations. Off-chain assets, meanwhile, are held on the Fund’s regulated custodians’ platforms, and all actions initiated by any one core team member will require checking and confirmation by another core team member to be authorized. In addition, the Fund’s independent fund manager will have oversight and governance control over all fund movements involving on-chain and off-chain assets held by the Fund. Even in the event of a smart contract breach or a hack, almost all of the TFUND Vault assets are held with regulated custodians at any given time</p>\n<p><strong>What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>Cogito has successfully undergone a code security assessment for TFUND by <a href=\"https://salusec.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Salus Security</a> on August, 2024</p>\n<p>Salus is a research-oriented security and zk firm, partners of the Binance ecosystem and has a track record of securing over 200 projects with zero exploits.

However, under the previous compensation system, the following rule applied:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h6>2.6.3.4.1</h6>\n<p>An AD buffer stops accumulating when it contains 3 months of an AD’s budget. If an AD with 3 months of PD budget in their buffer moves from PD to RD, their buffer is not reduced but it does not continue to accumulate until it contains less than 3 months of RD budget.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a result, their buffer won’t be reduced, but they won’t continue accumulating funds. We’ll also maintain the restriction limiting their buffer usage to that of a reserve delegate since they haven’t contributed to the Atlas work during August. Next month, everyone will be able to access their buffer contents because we will transition to the new compensation system.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/aligned_delegates\">@Aligned_Delegates</a></p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/august-2024-aligned-delegate-payment-requests/25109\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/august-2024-aligned-delegate-payment-requests/25109","pubDate":"Mon, 16 Sep 2024 17:21:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25109"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/august-2024-aligned-delegate-payment-requests/25109.rss","#text":"August 2024 Aligned Delegate Payment Requests"},"filter":false},{"title":"Sky Organizational Structure","dc:creator":"Shiko","category":"New to MakerDAO","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-98970-sky-organizational-structure-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98970-sky-organizational-structure-1\"></a>Sky Organizational Structure</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/b/6b3443e94d221a67ccea0d834e207a67aa9a4e61.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fin4af8EBtYUyd17PVYrzOfsdgZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"Org chart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/b/6b3443e94d221a67ccea0d834e207a67aa9a4e61_2_690x497.png\" alt=\"Org chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"fin4af8EBtYUyd17PVYrzOfsdgZ\" width=\"690\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/b/6b3443e94d221a67ccea0d834e207a67aa9a4e61_2_690x497.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/b/6b3443e94d221a67ccea0d834e207a67aa9a4e61.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/b/6b3443e94d221a67ccea0d834e207a67aa9a4e61.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F5F5\"></a></div><br>\nIllustration of the high-level roles in Sky<p></p>\n<p>Notable context:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anyone can submit a proposal.

Product Information</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product:</strong> USYC earns short-term risk-free rate returns. Our clients, upon successfully completing KYC/AML, can instantly mint and redeem USYC into their whitelisted wallets 24/7 from USDC and PYUSD. USYC can also be minted and redeemed into USDT and fiat. The token is available as Ethereum ERC20, NEAR, BASE and will soon be integrated with Axelar.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset:</strong> USYC is the on-chain representation of Hashnote’s regulated International Short Duration Yield Fund (iSDYF). iSDYF uses its prime broker Marex and custodian BNY Mellon to invest cash into overnight reverse-repo to ensure minimised market risk, duration risk, and credit risk. Whether the investor chooses to purchase with fiat or stablecoin, the amount of USYC the investor receives is equal to the deposit amount divided by the current price of USYC. Hashnote mints into the investor’s wallet an amount of USYC tokens equivalent to the number of shares the investor has in the iSDYF.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong> We update the price of the token daily to reflect the yield that has been earned overnight.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong> Hashnote International Short Duration Yield Fund Ltd (iSDYF), a mutual fund providing the USYC product, is domiciled in the Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p>It is managed by its investment manager, Hasnote Management LLC, a United States limited liability company formed in Delaware.</p>\n<p>We adhere to strict regulations, ensuring our operations meet institutional investment standards.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong> Our PPM permits investment into T Bills but currently we only invest into reverse repo.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong> No we don’t do any hedging; however, reverse repo can be described as a derivative product.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc).

Hashnote will accept PUYSD, USDT, USDC or fiat as subscription and redemption assets. Upon acceptance as MakerDAO collateral, Hashnote will make DAI a redemption asset.</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong> We aim to enable instant, 24/7 minting and redemption of USYC into more stablecoins. USYC stands out from the rest of the tokenized RWAs as it finds its application across the digital asset ecosystem as a whole. As a treasury management tool and an alternative to holding stablecoins we are already backing the<a href=\"https://usual.money/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Usual</a> stablecoin. As a collateral token used by custodians, centralised and decentralised exchanges, USYC boosts liquidity and collateral efficiency for trading, borrowing, and lending. To expand its reach, we are forming new partnerships, bridging to more chains, and adding market makers. By 2025, we plan to be available on multiple venues and currently adding more market makers.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98951-iv-legal-structure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98951-iv-legal-structure-4\"></a>IV.

Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong> Here’s a summary of the USYC infrastructure, which focuses on scalability, security, and compliance:</p>\n<p><em>On-Chain Overview:</em></p>\n<p>Flexible smart contracts allow for upgrades, with key functions like minting, burning, and managing the Entitlements securely controlled by Hashnote to maintain compliance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entitlements Investors who pass KYC/AML checks have their wallet addresses receive entitlements, enabling them to interact with USYC. Entitlements are the gatekeepers to most of the functionality of USYC. The wallets associated with KYC’ed entities receive a Role that entitles them to mint, hold, transfer, and burn the token.The USYC Smart Contracts queries the Entitlements contract to verify the caller of a transaction has the appropriate permissions to perform a transaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to checking that a wallet is permissioned, the Entitlements contract also performs OFAC sanctions checks by querying an on-chain oracle for matches to sanctioned addresses. The oracle is maintained by<a href=\"https://go.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-oracle-docs.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Chainalysis</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minting &amp; Burning Hashnote mints new USYC tokens when investors subscribe manually (via Fiat or stables). Investors can burn their tokens or submit a request to Hashnote to initiate redemption.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tellers offer 24/7 subscriptions and redemption capability. Redemptions are subject to liquidity (see Teller section for more details)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transfers &amp; Oracle USYC tokens can be transferred between whitelisted addresses, and asset prices are regularly updated via an Oracle feed.

What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong> Hashnote has engaged several independent auditors to review our smart contracts. The audits have been completed by Sentnl and ChainSafe as well as an independent security researcher Anton Cheng.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98951-vi-makerdao-ecosystem-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98951-vi-makerdao-ecosystem-6\"></a>VI. MakerDAO Ecosystem</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong> We submitted an <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/usyc-mip6-collateral-application-hashnote-s-us-yield-coin/25050\">application to MakerDao</a> offering USYC instead of <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/wbtc-changes-and-risk-mitigation-10-august-2024/24844\">WBTC</a> addressing the community’s risk concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong> Hashnote is approaching Maker with longevity and stability and mind, and we believe that introducing Hashnote USYC is fully aligned with “<a href=\"https://endgame.makerdao.com/endgame/overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Endgame Plan</a>” proposed by Rune Christensen.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrating Hashnote USYC supports this strategy by increasing the share of Real-World Assets (RWA) as collateral, thereby reducing dependence on USDC and significantly improving the profit and loss margin of MakerDAO. <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/centrifuge-maker-a-partner-s-view-of-real-world-assets/17439\">Dai can best scale its usage and maintain its peg by issuing against non-correlated, yield bearing, and reliable assets. </a></li>\n<li>A strategic partnership with Hashnote expands Maker growth opportunities by tapping into a larger and more stable addressable market: professional and institutional crypto investors and tradfi community alike. Unlike other yield-bearing tokens, Hashnote USYC use-case goes beyond treasury management savings vehicle. USYC is designed and is growing to be the universally accepted collateral token accepted by centralised and decentralised exchanges as well as lending and custody providers and further down the line should be introduced to venues like CME to further enhance collateral efficiency in the tradfi space.</li>\n<li>Through this strategic partnership, Hashnote community and its stakeholders are likely to be attracted to Spark, which would <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600\">positively impact the growth of SparkLend</a>. Hashnote is actively working on launching multiple lending products in collaboration with centralised venues, attracting professional investors and large institutional clients. We anticipate that this will bring a similar user base to the MakerDAO ecosystem, positioning it as a gateway into DeFi for users who haven’t explored DeFi yet.</li>\n<li>Hashnote fully addresses and safeguards the concerns of the Maker community while ensuring legal recognition of their assets. The Hashnote team comes with extensive experience in traditional finance and aims to leverage the transparency and credibility offered by blockchain technology to bridge the gap between on-chain and off-chain asset representations.</li>\n<li>With Hashnote’s expertise in tokenization, Maker Governance can gain a powerful gateway to engage in “real-world” activities. We fully agree that DeFi requires a foundational layer of collateral anchored to more stable, secular supply and demand dynamics, and RWAs are a crucial step toward achieving this vision.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong> Morpho is a lending protocol that enhances capital efficiency by optimising yields on lending pools. Hashnote USYC serves as <a href=\"https://app.morpho.org/vault?vault=0xbEEF02e5E13584ab96848af90261f0C8Ee04722a&amp;network=mainnet\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">collateral</a> on the Morpho platform for the <a href=\"https://www.steakhouse.financial/projects/usyc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Steakhouse PYUSD vault</a>, making it the key venue for borrowing and lending PYUSD on Ethereum mainnet and offering one of the most efficient environments for PYUSD lending.</p>\n<p>This partnership allows users to earn higher yields compared to traditional DeFi lending protocols by leveraging the stability and potential returns of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs). Additionally, the collaboration attracts institutional clients to DeFi by combining Morpho’s efficient lending mechanisms with Hashnote’s regulated, tokenized products, providing a strong value proposition for large-scale investors.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong> Yes, Hashnote is a diversified asset manager that continuously launches new products.

Company Details</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Company description</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Spiko</strong> is a Paris-based startup building and operating a platform for issuing, managing, and distributing tokenized funds. Spiko aims to become the foremost financial market infrastructure, enabling the native issuance and management of all types of financial instruments on blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>Throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024, Spiko spearheaded and oversaw the project that led to the launch of the first Ethereum-native USD- and EUR-denominated Money Market Funds (MMFs) approved in the European Union. Shares of the Spiko MMFs, launched to the public in mid-June 2024, are exclusively issued as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks.</p>\n<p>Three months after their launch, the Spiko MMFs have amassed $92M in assets under management, handled $135M in investment and redemption flows, and generated over $300K in interest. Consequently, Spiko has quickly become one of the leading tokenizers of T-Bills, with its tokenized MMFs experiencing the fastest growth in the sector in recent weeks (<a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocols/RWA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">source</a>).</p>\n<p>Spiko developed and maintains the transfer agent software used to manage the Spiko MMFs on-chain. The Funds are distributed by <strong>Spiko Finance</strong>, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spiko that is regulated as an investment adviser in France.</p>\n<p>Both Spiko and Spiko Finance are French simplified join-stock companies (<em>société par actions simplifiée</em> or “SAS” under French law). The Spiko SICAV, which is the legal entity that issues and manages the Spiko MMFs, is completely separate from Spiko and Spiko Finance. The Spiko SICAV is owned by token holders, with each token representing a share in the Spiko MMFs.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/f/4f4afb12c4bc68b4ad974ebe67d7a3df10cc08bc.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bjsmFIKGFjiRba4rnZzzSBECnfe.png?dl=1\" title=\"1.

Product Information</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Describe the product</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund is a sub-fund of the Spiko SICAV.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SICAV\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SICAV</a> (which stands for “Société d’Investissement à Capital Variable”) is a European investment fund structure akin to a U.S. open-end mutual fund, allowing investors to subscribe to and redeem shares while the fund’s assets are professionally managed.</p>\n<p>Incorporated in France under French law, the Spiko SICAV currently manages two sub-funds approved by the French Financial Markets Authority (<a href=\"https://www.amf-france.org/en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Autorité des Marchés Financiers</a>) as short-term variable net asset value MMFs under the UCITS Directive (Directive 2009/65/EC) and the MMF Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1131).</p>\n<p>UCITS (which stands for “Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities”) funds are the European Union’s equivalent to U.S. mutual funds. Before a UCITS can be marketed to investors, its prospectus must be approved by a national competent authority of the European Union. This process is similar to that of a mutual fund’s approval by the SEC in the United States.</p>\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund is the world’s first public money market fund whose shares (USTBL) are natively issued as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. <em>N.B.: in this context, ‘public,’ as opposed to ‘private,’ means that the Fund is approved for distribution to the general public, including retail (i.e. non-professional, non-accredited or non-qualified) investors.</em></p>\n<p>The Fund’s prospectus references the smart contract that officially serves as the shareholder register: 0xe4880249745eAc5F1eD9d8F7DF844792D560e750. As a result, the blockchain acts  as the definitive source of truth for the shareholder register, rather than simply being an on-chain copy of a separate centralized database. The Fund’s shares (USTBL) can be custodied at investors’ discretion using any wallet technology compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the key characteristics of the Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th><strong>Spiko US T-Bills MMF (USTBL)</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ISIN</strong></td>\n<td>FR001400ODM9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bloomberg ticker</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPKUSMM:FP\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SPKUSMM</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Currency</strong></td>\n<td>$ USD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Type of fund</strong></td>\n<td>UCITS short-term VNAV Money Market Fund under EU law</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fund domicile</strong></td>\n<td>France</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>National competent authority</strong></td>\n<td>French Financial Markets Authority (<a href=\"https://www.amf-france.org/en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AMF</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Legal structure</strong></td>\n<td>SICAV</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Investment policy</strong></td>\n<td>T-Bills issued by the U.S. Treasury</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Benchmark</strong></td>\n<td>Effective Federal Funds Rate (<a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EFFR</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Maximum weighted average maturity</strong></td>\n<td>60 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Use of income</strong></td>\n<td>Accumulating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fees</strong></td>\n<td>Management fees: 0.30% (per annum, deducted daily on a prorata basis).

Investors’ funds are fully safeguarded from the risk of Twenty First Capital’s bankruptcy. If Twenty First Capital were to go bankrupt, the Spiko SICAV would seek a new asset manager to take over the management of the Fund.

It must also ensure that, in the event of its own insolvency or that of any of its sub-custodians, the UCITS assets held in custody are ring-fenced, meaning they are protected from being used to satisfy the creditors of the depositary or its sub-custodians.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bankruptcy of CACEIS Fund Administration (Valuator)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event of CACEIS Fund Administration’s bankruptcy, the Spiko SICAV would appoint a new fund valuator.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bankruptcy of PricewaterhouseCoopers (Auditor)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event of PwC’s bankruptcy, the Spiko SICAV would appoint a new fund auditor.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><em><strong>What rights do tokenholders have?</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>USTBL are shares of the Spiko US T-Bills Money Market Fund.</p>\n<p>Ownership of USTBL confers voting rights at Spiko SICAV’s general shareholders’ meeting.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Investors in the Spiko MMFs include numerous Web3 for-profits and non-profits that use USTBL and/or EUTBL to earn daily returns at the USD or EUR risk-free rate on their treasury holdings, and manage on/off-ramps between traditional banking and modern blockchain rails.

USTBL is operated by top-tier financial services firms, with assets held with the world’s largest custodians. Owning a portfolio of T-Bills held in custody, rather than being exposed to the counterparty risk of an issuer (whether it’s a stablecoin issuer or an SPV), would be valuable for the Sky ecosystem. Importantly, USTBL is also completely insulated from crypto market dynamics because the Fund does not hold crypto-assets on its balance sheet. For instance, USTBL is entirely shielded from the risk of a stablecoin depegging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Secondly, <strong>USTBL would provide the Sky ecosystem with exceptional legal protection and regulatory clarity on its reserves</strong>. USTBL is a regulated product, approved in the largest asset management jurisdiction in continental Europe, and governed by some of the most protective investor rules globally (e.g. the UCITS Directive and the MMF Regulation). USTBL is authorized for public distribution, ensuring the highest level of disclosure through a prospectus that cannot be modified without the regulator’s approval. Importantly, USTBL is also issued in a jurisdiction that recognizes  blockchains (incl. public ones such as Ethereum) as the primary source of truth for the shareholder register.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thirdly, <strong>USTBL would provide the Sky ecosystem with oversight and voting rights in the governance of the tokenized T-Bills held in its reserves</strong>. Sky would indeed have voting rights at the Spiko SICAV’s general shareholders’ meeting in proportion to its USTBL holdings. Besides, a representative from the Sky ecosystem could join the board of the SICAV issuing USTBL if elected by the general assembly of shareholders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, <strong>UTSBL would grant Sky direct access to the issuer of a key asset in its reserves for subscriptions and redemptions in both fiat (USD) and stablecoins (USDC, USDT, USDS)</strong>. USTBL are minted or burned once per business day around 10:30 AM CET at the previous day’s NAV.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><em><strong>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Currently, USTBL (as well as EUTBL, our EUR-denominated tokenized MMF) is held in the treasury of many Web3 organizations but are not yet integrated into DeFi protocols.

Describe the underlying asset</h3>\n<p>The Fund will seek to provide a liquid, low risk portfolio through exposure to U.S Treasury Bills (T-bills) with maturities of between 0-3 months. The portfolio is carefully structured to manage yield curve, duration, and liquidity risks.</p>\n<p>T-Bills are highly rated short-term debt securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, with maturities of up to one year. They are widely recognized as one of the safest investment vehicles due to their high credit quality supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Furthermore, interest rate risk and volatility are low due to the short-term maturity of the instrument.</p>\n<p>The fund started with a portfolio T-bills with maturities of between 0-6 months.

This daily accrual ensures that the token price accurately represents the cumulative interest earned by the underlying T-Bill portfolio.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-4-what-is-the-jurisdiction-of-the-issuer-and-key-entities-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-4-what-is-the-jurisdiction-of-the-issuer-and-key-entities-10\"></a>4.

Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</h3>\n<p>The Fund is established as a BVI professional fund. This legal structure provides the best possible investor protection of any tokenized treasury product currently available. It is the same legal structure used by Blackrock, although that offering has been adapted to be open to US investors while Anemoy is exclusively offshore to avoid potential regulatory risk from the SEC or other US regulators.</p>\n<p>The BVI professional fund structure provides direct recourse for investors to the segregated and ring-fenced assets of the Liquid Treasury Fund (i.e., US T-Bills and USD cash) in case of liquidation of the Fund.</p>\n<p>Importantly, this direct recourse is <em><strong>enshrined in law</strong></em> rather than a mere contractual right.</p>\n<p>This structure is more advantageous for investors than other tokenized treasury products such as SPV/debt offerings or exempt US 3(c)(7) funds.</p>\n<p>In the case of products structured as debt offerings issued by an SPV, the investors have no exclusive claim to the assets and will need to prove their claim as against other potential creditors such as tax and other governmental authorities that may have priority. Moreover, as the investors do not have a perfected security interest in the treasuries, the claim may be challenged in court causing an extended timeline for recovery of potentially many years.</p>\n<p>In the case of a 3(c)(7) fund, unlike a BVI fund, this is an exempt offering with no oversight by any regulatory authority.

Describe the technical implementation of your product</h3>\n<p>The Centrifuge protocol has a few key components:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Asset-level tokenization</strong>: Centrifuge asset pools are made up of individually tokenized real-world assets. This supports a range of asset types, from Treasury bills such as with the LTF pool, to real-estate assets such as the New Silver pool and ABS such as BlockTower, to any other asset. The asset-level tokenization enables a deep level of transparency and automated reporting for funds building on Centrifuge.<br>\n<strong>2. Liquidity pools</strong>: For each asset pool, there can be liquidity pools, deployed on multiple blockchain networks, and with multiple assets. Today, LTF is live on Ethereum, Base and Celo (more coming), and supports USDC and FRAX. Through this architecture, other assets including USDS can easily be added.<br>\n<strong>3. ERC-7540 support</strong>: Each liquidity pool is fully compliant with the recently finalized asynchronous version of ERC-4626. This standardizes asynchronous investments and redemptions, perfect for RWAs. On top of this, features can be built such as automated allocation management across asset classes, or automated redemptions.</p>\n<p>Each fund share is tokenized as a standard ERC-20 token, with transfer restrictions built in (based on the ERC-1404 standard). The restrictions are managed by the fund administrator and stored onchain in a member list contract.</p>\n<p>Onchain smart contracts are also used for the entire flow-of-funds, ensuring that funds can only be transferred between investors, the Centrifuge protocol, and the fund’s on/off-ramp accounts.</p>\n<p>The price of the ERC-20 token is based on an onchain NAV calculation, which uses the asset-level tokenization to aggregate the prices from the individual assets. The prices are set directly by the fund administrator. Soon, Chronicle will also launch the RWA oracle for the LTF token, which will add additional third-party verification to the NAV &amp; onchain prices.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-38\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-38\"></a>5.

This capability can be harnessed for advanced reporting within the Sky ecosystem, automating liquidity management, and integrating directly with Atlas components, such as onchain Asset-Liability Management structures.</li>\n<li><strong>Active Ecosystem Contributor</strong>: As an active partner within the Web3 space and a long-standing contributor to DeFi, Centrifuge is well-positioned to support the development and success of the Sky ecosystem. Whether through smart contracts, backend infrastructure, or user interfaces, we are committed to using our technical resources and domain expertise to augment and strengthen the capabilities of Sky’s RWA SubDAO/Star initiatives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We already have active partnerships with key participants in the ecosystem, such as Chronicle Labs, Ankura Trust Company, and many of the third-party RWA service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Centrifuge as a Product Partner</strong></p>\n<p>Centrifuge is uniquely capable and familiar with building products alongside not only DAOs, but specifically with Sky. This deep experience positions us as the ideal partner to craft RWA related products, features, and internal systems that align with the goals of Sky.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We are fully committed to dedicating Centrifuge’s resources—including our legal, marketing, business development, product, and engineering teams—to these efforts.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Lucas Vogelsang, Centrifuge</em></p>\n<p>When developing new products, our focus is on key objectives: increasing demand for DAI/USDS, enhancing utility for DAI/USDS, and growing the SparkLend user base. Leveraging our team of domain experts and strong relationships across both DeFi and traditional finance sectors, we bring these products to market in sustainable and impactful ways. Our goal is to create solutions that not only address immediate needs but also foster long-term growth and stability within the Sky ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Below are a series of proposals that we would like to develop with Sky/Spark, this includes:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Proposal</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Function</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>PSM INTEGRATION TO SUPPORT RWA TOKENS</td>\n<td>Centrifuge proposes an enhanced “PSM-like” structure that allows RWA tokens to be swapped for DAI/USDS at the current market price minus a fee. This structure would provide users with instant liquidity, enabling any holder to immediately access DAI or USDS, or convert their DAI/USDS into RWA tokens. By integrating this feature, Centrifuge could significantly enhance liquidity and flexibility within the Sky ecosystem, making it easier for users to interact with real-world assets.</td>\n<td>Add DAI/USDS utility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DAI/USDS ENABLED SUBSCRIPTIONS AND REDEMPTIONS</td>\n<td>Enable DAI/USDS for all Centrifuge subscription and redemption activities, streamlining the process for users to engage with RWAs. This feature would simplify transactions within the ecosystem, further integrating DAI/USDS into the broader financial operations of real-world asset management.</td>\n<td>Add DAI/USDS utility and grow demand</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DIVERSIFIED YIELD SOURCES FOR sDAI (RWA sDAI 2.0)</td>\n<td>Introduce a revamped version of the sDAI savings product, which blends yields from both liquid and illiquid RWA products. This new product, designed with institutional buyers in mind, would be KYC-compliant, allowing Sky to tap into a different segment of capital that requires regulated investment avenues. By expanding the yield offerings in a sustainable and diversified manner, Centrifuge could drive increased demand for DAI/USDS, particularly among institutional investors.</td>\n<td>Grow demand for DAI/USDS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sDAI TERM BONDS</td>\n<td>Offer a savings-like structure that locks DAI/USDS for a specified duration, providing a higher yield in return. sDAI Term Bonds would drive demand for DAI/USDS by offering users an attractive, secure investment option with a fixed term. This product would not only diversify the savings options available within the Sky ecosystem but also ensure a steady demand for DAI/USDS over a longer period.</td>\n<td>Grow demand for DAI/USDS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RWA INTEGRATIONS WITH SPARKLEND</td>\n<td>Following the success of our Morpho deployment, we propose bringing both similar and unique products to SparkLend to integrate with consumer facing fintechs, and allow Spark to collateralize DAI/USDS with higher yielding assets indirectly through lending markets that otherwise may be too volatile to directly hold. This accomplishes all three of the key objectives and attributes TVL to SparkLend itself.</td>\n<td>Grow SparkLend user base, add DAI/USDS utility, and grow DAI/USDS demand</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Through these product offerings, Centrifuge aims to elevate the Sky/Spark ecosystems by integrating real-world assets in ways that are efficient, transparent, and aligned with the long-term goals of both Sky/Spark and its users. Our commitment to leveraging our extensive experience and resources ensures that these products are not just theoretical but can be successfully implemented to drive meaningful value for the entire ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-42\"></a>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</h3>\n<p>Centrifuge has been a leading force within the industry for RWA integrations, consistently at the forefront of DeFi capabilities. We were the first to launch a tokenized integration with DeFi with the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/rwa-market-recap/10888\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWA Market</a> back in 2021. Our latest lending market with Morpho, launched in collaboration with other RWA providers, exemplifies our continued commitment to structuring institutional RWA DeFi arrangements onchain.</p>\n<p>Some highlights of our integration work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Morpho Market</strong>: Our <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/08/27/tokenization-pioneer-centrifuge-unveils-lending-market-with-morpho-coinbase/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWA Lending Market on Morpho</a> represents a groundbreaking deal in DeFi, bringing together a range of technologies from tokenization to identity verification, a mix of RWA providers and assets, and a mix of ecosystem capabilities covering L2 <strong>networks</strong>, externalized risk curation, and DeFi primitives. Built on Coinbase’s Base Layer-2 network, this market allows for the seamless collateralization of RWAs for borrowing. What sets it apart from other efforts in this field is its ability to provide compliant, reliable yield and asset opportunities, in a secure package that appeals to institutional and retail users alike. Built into the market are Coinbase Verifications, a KYC checker built into the Base network, that gate-keep U.S and sanctioned users from lending into the market. This is the first use-case for Verifications in DeFi, furthering the institutional case for finance on smart contract rails.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Morpho and Centrifuge integration exemplifies the best our industry has to offer. It successfully combines all of the technologies that we’ve been working for years to bring together - real-world assets, decentralized lending, onchain identity, smart accounts, and open risk curation - it really is the future of finance.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Paul Frambot, Morpho</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trident Trust</strong>: Our latest <a href=\"https://centrifuge.mirror.xyz/pn5NlZ5UY5pdtOy_FFZ1cNWr0Dn1QBk2yCeJ6ZXQQoc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fund management platform</a> is designed to offer a total solution for credit funds, that seamlessly integrates onchain and offchain data into a unified control panel. Our integration with Trident Trust, an industry leading fund administrator, underscores our <strong>platform’s</strong> ability to automate reporting, streamline operations, and enhance transparency, making it easier for asset managers to transition to onchain finance. With an integration pipeline that covers custodians, other fund administrators, and more third-parties, our fund management platform is how Centrifuge unlocks transparency and operational efficiencies and brings it to the market.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We’re excited to work with Anemoy to build one of the first tokenized, regulated funds that maintains an onchain record of portfolio data and net asset valuations. This increases transparency while streamlining typically burdensome reporting and reconciliation processes.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— David Mungall, Trident Trust</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chronicle</strong>: The Chronicle RWA oracle has been integrated to provide the most credibly verifiable and transparent price feeds for assets on the Centrifuge platform. Our integration <strong>creates</strong> verifiability, not just into the total NAV of the fund, but to the entire portfolio of the fund, including granular asset-level details. This enables stakeholders to continuously track, in a trustless manner, the full movements of cash from the onchain USDS and USDC holdings, to offchain cash balances, to the detailed list of holdings at the LTF’s custodian. This creates a level of transparency that is groundbreaking for RWAs in DeFi.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Our partnership with Centrifuge and Anemoy demonstrates how decentralized oracles can bring a new level of trust and transparency to real-world assets. With Chronicle’s RWA Oracle, investors gain an unopinionated, verifiable view of the LTF, improving their confidence in the asset’s security and stability.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Nik Kunkel, Chronicle</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Archax</strong>: Anemoy has entered into an agreement to integrate LTF in the institutional platform of Archax. Archax is the first ever digital securities exchange regulated by the FCA in London. <strong>Targeted</strong> at institutions, Archax institutional clients will be able to access LTF in the first distribution partnership undertaken by Anemoy. Archax also has its FCA brokerage, custody and crypto permissions.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We are thrilled to be working with Anemoy, Centrifuge and Janus Henderson to offer our users access to tokenized treasury bills. This collaboration reflects our ongoing mission to integrate real-world assets into the onchain ecosystem, empowering our users to diversify their portfolios with institutional-grade products.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>— Simon Barnby, Archax</em></p>\n<p>We are excited to continue building on this work with Sky. We believe only the Centrifuge platform has proven the capability to unlock RWA and DeFi at a deep foundational level, and our work with our integration partners proves so.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98933-h-4-do-you-offer-or-plan-to-offer-other-products-that-could-be-appropriate-for-spark-or-other-subdaos-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-h-4-do-you-offer-or-plan-to-offer-other-products-that-could-be-appropriate-for-spark-or-other-subdaos-43\"></a>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Centrifuge is proud to share that we have lined up several product opportunities that are a strong fit for the Spark portfolio.</p>\n<p>These products are rooted in our experience with the Maker/Spark ecosystem, with a deep understanding of Spark’s preferred risk tolerances, and aligned around partnerships that accentuate</p>\n<p>In the supplementary documents sent privately to the submissions panel, we offer two new funds specifically tailored to the future investment objectives of Spark.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AAA Highly Liquid Bond Fund targeting returns in excess of Treasuries</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BBB+ Enhanced-Yield Public Credit Fund targeting higher returns for more diversification along the risk curve</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These funds aim to offer forward-looking solutions that help Spark navigate a volatile rate environment and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our objective is to position Spark to capitalize on potential market dislocations over the next 12 to 36 months, and support Spark’s own aspirations to diversify beyond the risk-free rate.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98933-in-summary-44\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98933-in-summary-44\"></a>In summary</h2>\n<p>Centrifuge, Anemoy, and their partners are uniquely positioned to provide Sky with an innovative, fully integrated, and compliant tokenization solution. Our proven track record, combined with the expertise of strategic partners like Janus Henderson, ensures that we can meet Sky’s current needs and adapt and grow as the market evolves. By leveraging our decentralized infrastructure and deep knowledge of traditional finance, we are confident that this proposal will set a new standard for onchain asset management.</p>\n<p>We are excited about the opportunity to deepen our partnership with Sky and pioneer the next chapter of real-world asset adoption together.

What is the project name?</strong></p>\n<p>Sky Dollar</p>\n<p><strong>2. What is the USDS token?</strong></p>\n<p>USDS is an upgraded version of the DAI token. Upgrading is optional. It is an ERC-20 token with permit functionality and EIP-1271 signature validation. The USDS token also enables two-way conversions between DAI and USDS tokens, using the mint and burn functions of both tokens. The conversion rate of the stablecoin is 1 DAI to 1 USDS.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What is the governance structure of the Sky Protocol and its USDS token?</strong></p>\n<p>The USDS token is the stablecoin token of the Sky Protocol, a decentralized and permissionless protocol formerly known as the Maker Protocol, governed entirely by its community, the Sky Ecosystem (formerly known as MakerDAO). Post dissolution of the Maker Foundation in 2021, the ecosystem continues to remain decentralized.</p>\n<p><strong>4. When will the token migration take place?</strong></p>\n<p>The start of the token migration from DAI to USDS is scheduled for September 18</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the process for migrating from DAI to USDS?</strong></p>\n<p>The migration is conducted using the DAI-USDS Converter contract, which allows two-way conversions between DAI and USDS using the mint and burn functions of both tokens. This process is non-custodial and permissionless, meaning that users retain full control of their assets throughout the conversion.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What is the project website?</strong></p>\n<p>The project is a decentralized and permissionless protocol, meaning there are no official websites; it can be accessed through various gateways including Sky.money and <a href=\"http://Spark.fi\">Spark.fi</a>, while anyone is free to develop new front ends, and users can always interact with the protocol directly through its smart contracts, including those contracts governing the Sky native tokens.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98920-tokenomics-and-supply-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98920-tokenomics-and-supply-2\"></a>Tokenomics and Supply</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Will the migration introduce new tokenomics?</strong></p>\n<p>USDS is meant to replace DAI as the stablecoin of the Sky Protocol, so its function remains the same with the added ability to earn token rewards and to access the Savings Rate.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Are there any jurisdictional restrictions for using the Sky Protocol and its USDS stablecoin?</strong></p>\n<p>As a decentralized and permissionless protocol, the Sky Protocol itself, including the contracts for its native stablecoin, USDS, and native governance token, SKY, have no inherent jurisdictional restrictions. USDS tokens, and the Sky Protocol, are by design, borderless and accessible to anyone with an internet connection and the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>Independent interfaces that serve as gateways to the Sky Protocol may, at their own discretion, choose to implement their own access restrictions in light of regulatory considerations. However, these restrictions are specific to those interfaces and do not reflect any jurisdictional restrictions imposed by the Sky Protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Some interfaces, such as Sky.money, geo-block or restrict a number of jurisdictions, for some or all of the functions provided by the Sky Protocol. Please see the Sky.money Terms of Use for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Having launched the Fund in April 2023, The TBILL Fund has a 18 months live track record which ranks amongst the longest in the market. The Fund is also an on-chain native vault that utilises smart-contract technologies for settlement.</p>\n<p><strong>A Robust Regulatory-First Approach for a Global Audience</strong><br>\nOpenEden’s TBILL tokens (“<strong>$TBILL</strong>”) are issued by Hill Lights International Ltd (“<strong>TBILL Fund</strong>”), which is a British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission (“<strong>BVIFSC</strong>”) regulated professional fund established under the British Virgin Islands Securities and Investment Business Act 2010. The bankruptcy-remote TBILL Fund is managed by OpenEden’s affiliated entity, Adam Eve Capital Pte Ltd (“<strong>AEC</strong>”) which is a licensed fund management company (LFMC) that holds a Capital Markets Services License under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 and is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“<strong>MAS</strong>”). The investment manager of the TBILL Fund, AEC operates under an investment mandate to invest in short-dated T-Bills. $TBILL tokens of the Fund can be offered to Non-U.S Professional Investors defined under BVI SIBA Act and to U.S Accredited Investors defined under U.S Securities Act of 1993 Rule 501a (the Fund had filed a SEC Form D Notice to offer under Reg D 506c).</p>\n<p><strong>Institutional-grade Foundation with Best-in-Class Partners</strong><br>\nThe TBILL Fund’s portfolio of T-Bills are bought, sold and custodised through the Fund’s licensed Prime Broker, UK FCA registered StoneX Financial Limited, and custodised in the Prime Broker’s licensed sub-custodian, being BNP Paribas Bank, New York in segregated accounts in compliance with UK FAC’s CASS rules. As the Token Issuer is a regulated fund managed by a licensed fund manager, there are stringent regulatory requirements including the appointment of an independent fund administrator to (i) provide independent daily valuation of the $TBILL token’s Net Asset Value (“NAV”); and (ii) participate as an independent multi-sig party for all fund asset transfer transactions as an additional safeguard against fraud. The Fund has also appointed KPMG as its tax advisor and is subject to annual audits on its balance sheet and financials. More recently, the TBILL Fund was awarded an <strong>“A-bf” Bond Fund Rating by Moody’s</strong>, the first and only of any tokenized T-BIlls product globally to receive an “investment-grade” credit rating. The “A” rating from Moody’s is a validation of OpenEden’s dedication to building a reliable primitive for the DeFi ecosystem to access tokenized T-Bills as a source of on-chain yields. <strong>Ernst &amp; Young also completed an independent audit</strong> on the OE TBILL Vault’s critical processes and controls in relation to the TBILL Fund’s KYC/AML procedures, valuation methodologies and the Fund’s asset transfer and custody procedures and controls. OpenEden is proud to have achieved the second highest rating with no critical or high risk findings.</p>\n<p><strong>Truly Crypto-native, Transparent and 24/7/365 Real-time Access</strong><br>\n$TBILL tokens can be minted instantly 24/7/365 on-chain via the OE TBILL Vault using USDC, and $TBILL tokens are held in the investor’s self-custodial wallet. The OE TBILL Vault platform offers real-time, instant on-chain minting of T-Bill backed tokens, thus removing settlement risks and allowing investors to earn yield from the point of minting till the point of redemption, maximising capital efficiency.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Project name: OpenEden Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product name: TBILL (OpenEden Tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills Fund)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product type / underlying asset: U.S. Treasury Bills</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Issuer jurisdiction: British Virgin Islands (Issuer), Singapore (Investment Manager)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product website: <a href=\"https://openeden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://openeden.com/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Primary contact name, title, and method of contact:</p>\n<p>Contact name: Jeremy Ng<br>\nTitle: Co-Founder<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:jeremy.ng@openeden.com\">jeremy.ng@openeden.com</a><br>\nTelegram: <span class=\"mention\">@ly3333</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98909-ii-company-details-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-ii-company-details-2\"></a>II.

Describe the product:</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Proposed Product : OpenEden $TBILL</strong></em><br>\nAs previously explained above in this RFP, the issuer of the $TBILL, being the TBILL Fund, is a registered professional fund (“<strong>Fund</strong>”) established under the British Virgin Islands Securities and Investment Business Act 2010 (“<strong>SIBA</strong>”) and regulated by the BVIFSC. The TBILL Fund is managed by AEC (as defined above), a wholly owned subsidiary of the OpenEden Group, which is a licensed fund management company (LFMC) that holds a Capital Markets Services License (CMSL) under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 and is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The TBILL Fund is rated “A” by Moody’s.</p>\n<p>The TBILL Fund operates the OE TBILL Vault, a smart contract vault that provides investors with direct exposure to a pool of short-dated U.S. T-Bills and overnight reverse repurchase agreements through the minting of the $TBILL. $TBILL is backed 1:1 by short-dated U.S. T-Bills and a small portion of U.S. Dollar (“<strong>USD</strong>”) held in bankruptcy remote segregated accounts in the Fund’s name. $TBILLs can be minted instantly 24/7/365, allowing investors to earn yield backed by the U.S. government on their USDC subscription at the point-of-mint itself, rather than having to wait up to T+2 business days as compared to traditional funds.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault operates on a zero-trust protocol, ensuring that all transactions are fully atomic, automated, transparent and managed on-chain without manual intervention. The protocol smart contract dictates that $TBILL can only be minted in the presence of the underlying asset, USDC, thus ensuring each token is always backed by actual assets. This minimises reliance on trust, making our system more secure and transparent than traditional incumbents. The OE TBILL Vault does not have the capability to freely mint tokens, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised token creation.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault is a permissioned protocol, which means that an investor has to meet specific criteria before the investor is eligible to hold $TBILL issued by the Fund. The OE TBILL Vault is currently only accessible to “Professional Investors’’ as defined under SIBA and to U.S. “Accredited Investors’’ within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act. $TBILL can only be minted and redeemed via the OE TBILL Vault by whitelisted wallets that have been fully onboarded after completing the Fund’s KYC/KYB process. As a permissioned token, $TBILL are transferable between whitelisted wallets.</p>\n<p>The $TBILL token is an EIP-20-compliant representation of an investor’s economic interest in the Fund. By depositing USDC and minting $TBILL, the investor will have legal rights to the redemption value of the net assets held by the Fund, proportional to the amount of $TBILL the investor holds relative to the total outstanding supply of $TBILL. The $TBILL minted by the investor are held in the investor’s whitelisted self custodial wallet.</p>\n<p>Whitelisted investors are also provided with access to the investor dashboard visible on the OE TBILL Vault dApp. The dashboard provides the investor with a real-time view of their $TBILL balance and their realised and unrealised P/L. Please find the sample screenshot of the investor dashboard displayed below.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/A7En9msFzoJcuK6zaU0QmlgBkUB.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_602x499.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"A7En9msFzoJcuK6zaU0QmlgBkUB\" width=\"602\" height=\"499\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_602x499.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_903x748.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/d/fd2bacd095d598cb43b6913687c5f879615d35bd_2_1204x998.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8FAF9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em><strong>Investment strategy</strong></em><br>\nThe Fund aims to provide the highest possible level of income generation while maintaining liquidity and maximum safety of principal.

The 2023 audited financial statements are available upon request.</p>\n<p>A very important point we wish to highlight is that OpenEden has recently completed an independent audit by Ernst &amp; Young LLP who performed a thorough review of critical aspects of the OE TBILL Vault, which included the investment manager’s policies, controls and procedures concerning AML/KYC, custody and valuation of the Fund’s assets (both digital and TradFi) in accordance with applicable Monetary Authority of Singapore (“<strong>MAS</strong>”) guidelines and leading industry practice for asset managers.</p>\n<p>The design and operations of the following internal controls were reviewed –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Adherence with applicable/relevant MAS Notice and Guidelines on Prevention of Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (“AML/CFT”), including sufficient AML risk assessment methodology focusing on the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Customer due diligence during onboarding and ongoing basis including corroborating source of funds and source of wealth (where applicable)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate Transaction Monitoring processes including transactions involving transfer of digital asset/ stable coin as well as adherence to travel rule (where applicable)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate Name Screening controls (including wallet screening where applicable)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate Suspicious Transaction reporting controls focusing on maintenance of records and timeliness of reporting procedures</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate policies and procedures on the methodology to identify, assess and monitor the enterprise-wide ML/TF risk</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Custody arrangement policies and procedures in place to demonstrate sufficient governance and oversight by Board of Directors /senior management as well as ensuring that independent custodians are suitably licensed, registered or authorised in their respective jurisdictions in line with the requirements from MAS Guidelines on Licensing, Registration and Conduct of Business for Fund Management Companies as well as Securities and Futures (Licensing And Conduct Of Business) Regulations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate controls and oversight is in place for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>the deposit process (i.e. depositing USDC token from customer’s private wallet into custodian account) with appropriate assessment to ensure that custody service provider maintains adequate risk management controls to ensure integrity and security of customer’s digital payment token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the transfer from custodian account to brokerage account process (i.e. transfer of US dollar from custodian account to brokerage account).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the withdrawal process (i.e. USDC token withdrawal from custodial account to customer’s private wallet).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for segregation of customer’s assets from their own assets to mitigate loss or misuse of customer’s assets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate disclosure of custody arrangements, terms and conditions and attendant risks to customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Appropriate segregation of duties to prevent conflict of interests (if applicable), including adherence with limits of authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Valuation policies and procedures in place to demonstrate sufficient governance and oversight by Board of Directors /senior management.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assets under management are subject to independent valuation and customer reporting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate controls and oversight is in place for the calculation of Net Asset Value (“NAV”) by the Fund in accordance with AEC’s Pricing Policy focusing on the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Review the appropriateness of the governance, controls and oversight of the valuation methodology in AEC’s Pricing Policy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review the source of valuation (i.e., the fair value) of each of the three asset components (i.e., US dollar, USDC and US Treasury Bills) that make up the NAV of the TBILL token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adequate controls and oversight is in place for the review of Net Asset Value calculated by the Fund, including review of the daily reconciliation of the calculation of the NAV by the fund manager which includes reconciliation of the number of TBILL tokens at the Valuation Point.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fund performance reports on Net Asset Value (if applicable) are timely and adequately prepared, reviewed and approved prior to presentation to stakeholder(s).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Upon completion of the review, Ernst &amp; Young assigned a <strong>Satisfactory</strong> rating (being the 2nd highest rating possible) to the independent audit report. Ernst &amp; Young were satisfied that elements of the internal control structure provide reasonable assurance that the relevant risks to the Investment Manager’s operating activities are adequately controlled.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-4-describe-the-technical-implementation-of-your-product-38\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-4-describe-the-technical-implementation-of-your-product-38\"></a>4. Describe the technical implementation of your product</h3>\n<p><strong>OE TBILL Vault</strong><br>\nThe OE TBILL Vault is developed based on the ERC-4626 Tokenized Vault standard, which is the industry standard for tokenized vaults. Subscriptions and redemption requests are seamlessly and transparently carried out on-chain through the OE TBILL Vault smart contract, which retrieves the latest price from the TBILL price oracle to process the request without manual intervention.</p>\n<p>The smart contract necessitates that $TBILL can only be minted in the presence of the underlying asset, USDC, thus ensuring that each $TBILL token is backed by actual assets. No $TBILL can be minted freely by the smart contract, which eliminates the risk of unauthorised token creation.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault smart contract has the whitelist feature that only allows wallet addresses that have been whitelisted with the smart contract to interact with the smart contract. Consequently, only whitelisted wallets can hold $TBILL. $TBILL can only be transferred between whitelisted wallets.</p>\n<p><strong>$TBILL Token and Token Price</strong><br>\nThe $TBILL is developed based on the ERC-20 token standard, and is minted or burned when USDC is deposited or redeemed from the OE TBILL Vault respectively.</p>\n<p>Token holders earn a return by holding $TBILL, where the token price is expected to increase in value over time. That increment in token price directly reflects the returns generated by the underlying T-Bills portfolio held by the Fund.</p>\n<p>The $TBILL token price is calculated as the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per token. The token price can be derived by dividing the NAV of the Fund by the total outstanding supply of $TBILL. The $TBILL token price was launched with a default value of 1.000000.</p>\n<p><strong>On-Chain Price Oracle</strong><br>\nThe price feed is a service responsible for consolidating and disseminating financial market data to the on-chain price oracle. Its primary function is to precisely calculate the $TBILL token price and transmit price data onto the on-chain price oracle. The integrity of the price feed is ensured through the price guards mechanism.</p>\n<p>Price guards are a circuit breaker mechanism designed to monitor the price of an asset or token and take appropriate actions when the price deviates unexpectedly beyond a predefined threshold. The purpose of the price guard is to protect the OE TBILL Vault or any other system from price manipulation or extreme price fluctuations by halting the OE TBILL Vault.</p>\n<p><strong>On-Chain Governance and Controls</strong><br>\nOpenEden has put in place a robust system of internal controls to uphold the safety of the OE TBILL Vault. These include the implementation of a consensus-based approval mechanism to move the OE TBILL Vault’s assets between venues, timelock, a role-based governance protocol, and multi-layered physical security, among others.</p>\n<p><strong>Timelock</strong> – Timelock implements a safety mechanism during the process of changing the OE TBILL Vault’s treasury wallet address. This is done as a precaution to protect the funds from being drained by a malicious user in the rare occasion when all the multisig wallets are compromised and the hacker is able to switch the address to offramp the funds. This timelock mechanism will give admins a 24-hour window to offramp the funds if the change in treasury address is an unintended one.</p>\n<p><strong>Multisig</strong> – The TBILL Vault is multisig, requiring multiple private keys, including the Fund’s independent third-party fund administrator to authorise and sign off on transactions involving on-chain assets. The use of on-ramp and off-ramp services will also be limited to authorised representatives from the OpenEden team via multisig operations. Off-chain assets, meanwhile, are held on the Fund’s regulated custodians’ platforms, and all actions initiated by any one core team member will require checking and confirmation by another core team member to be authorised. In addition, the Fund’s independent fund administrator will have oversight and governance control over all fund movements involving on-chain and off-chain assets held by the Fund. Even in the event of a smart contract breach or a hack, most of the OE TBILL Vault assets are held with regulated custodians at any given time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-39\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-5-what-audits-have-been-performed-on-the-smart-contracts-involved-with-your-product-by-whom-and-when-39\"></a>5.

Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</h3>\n<p>The OpenEden team has been recently selected as one of six tokenized T-Bills service providers (out of more than thirty applicants) by the Arbitrum Foundation as part of the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program. The selection process was vetted by an expert committee that focused on product structuring, quality, regulatory compliance and transparency. The selection of OpenEden as a service provider amongst 30 other participants is testament to the superior product offering, and strong commitment towards supporting DAO communities and to provide high-quality treasury management services.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our Co-Founder Eugene has been investing and supporting crypto-native projects since 2017, and advisor to HFT firm DWF Labs has since amassed more than 700 crypto projects with a number of DAO foundations. Through his extensive network of crypto-native connections, he would be able to bring much value and expertise in any formal DAO engagement. He was also a core member of a relatively small DAO called DAOvergence.</p>\n<p>OpenEden has onboarded multiple DAOs as users and thus is familiar and comfortable working with the often unique structures associated with DAOs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-2-beyond-yield-how-might-your-product-benefit-the-sparkdao-andor-makerdao-ecosystem-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-2-beyond-yield-how-might-your-product-benefit-the-sparkdao-andor-makerdao-ecosystem-42\"></a>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</h3>\n<p>The investment into OpenEden’s $TBILL is a strong step forward in demonstrating SparkDAO’s and Sky’s commitment towards diversifying its reserves into industry-leading tokenized money market funds that have excellent product structuring, regulatory compliance and transparency. OpenEden’s $TBILL is currently the only product on the market with an “A” rating by Moody’s and the largest Asia-based issuer of tokenized T-Bills. Furthermore, an allocation into $TBILL would entitle SparkDAO to additional token incentives as OpenEden Group consolidates its plans to launch a governance token in the coming months.</p>\n<p>OpenEden has a network of institutional partners such as State Street, Moody’s etc that can be aligned for an institutional adoption of SparksDAO and its product offerings.</p>\n<p>OpenEden group is very active and dominant in the regions of Asia and Europe, which positions us as the leading non-U.S. tokenized firm that can aid SparksDAO’s international expansion, especially in Asia.</p>\n<p>As the partnership with SparkDAO scales, OpenEden is well-positioned to collaborate with particularly on the launching of new products with an RWA focus due to its end-to-end tokenization suite of services such as issuance, tokenization, portfolio management, and distributions across a variety of blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>OpenEden group also owns a Singapore MAS Licensed Fund Management Company which allows us to be an investment advisor and manager to guide any DAOs, Sub-Daos or treasuries with regulatory-compliance.</p>\n<p>Finally, as tokenized RWAs continue to gain traction, this investment by SparkDAO could galvanise other projects and users in the Sky ecosystem to participate in the growth of tokenized RWAs within the ecosystem, either through direct investments or partnership integrations. The Sky ecosystem could be well-positioned to become the leading ecosystem for supporting tokenized RWAs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-3-does-the-product-have-integrations-with-any-other-platforms-43\"></a>3.

Investors can custodise $TBILL tokens in Zodia and use as collateral to trade OTC with Hidden Road Partners. $TBILL is also accepted as collateral by several OTC options Market Makers. $TBILL is integrated with Resonate, a yield-swap protocol for RWA yields. Discussions are currently ongoing for $TBILL to be used as collateral on CEXes, lending/borrowing DeFi protocols, DEXes and others.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98909-h-4-do-you-offer-or-plan-to-offer-other-products-that-could-be-appropriate-for-spark-or-other-subdaos-44\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98909-h-4-do-you-offer-or-plan-to-offer-other-products-that-could-be-appropriate-for-spark-or-other-subdaos-44\"></a>4.
