HTC utilized these and other funds to extend $2.1 million in loans to a consumer electronics company named Snakebyte. As of writing, the $2.1 million in loans to Snakebyte is the sole asset in the HTC pool, which serves as collateral for MakerDAO’s $1.6 million senior position.</p>\n<p>In April 2023, Snakebyte defaulted on its loan, prompting HTC to pursue legal action and successfully obtain a default judgment from the Superior Court of California - County of San Diego (the “Court”) against Snakebyte USA, Inc. This judgment empowered HTC to seize assets through a writ of attachment.</p>\n<p>Efforts to locate Snakebyte’s assets within the United States have proven challenging. However, legal counsel has advised that Snakebyte holds material assets in Germany. Consequently, HTC now seeks to enforce the California judgment in Germany, and requests a financial contribution from the DAO to cover the associated legal costs.</p>\n<p>The DAO Resolution below authorizes the allocation of $194,000 from the Launch Budget towards the HTC-Snakebyte litigation.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"dao-resolution-to-allocate-funds-to-htc-legal-action-against-snakebytehttpsipfsioipfsqmuiytry4bkv681tffe3ksj6gdleq27w34mqlw5lvrabod-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dao-resolution-to-allocate-funds-to-htc-legal-action-against-snakebytehttpsipfsioipfsqmuiytry4bkv681tffe3ksj6gdleq27w34mqlw5lvrabod-2\"></a><a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUiYTRy4BkV681tfFe3Ksj6gdLEq27w34MqLw5LvRaBoD\">DAO Resolution to Allocate Funds to HTC Legal Action Against Snakebyte</a></h4>\n<h2><a name=\"key-figures-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#key-figures-3\"></a>Key Figures</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Amount</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Total borrowed by Snakebyte</td>\n<td>$2.1 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total owed to Maker</td>\n<td>$1.6 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>US legal costs estimate</td>\n<td>$73,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>German legal costs estimate</td>\n<td>$121,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total legal costs estimate</strong></td>\n<td><strong>$194,000</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Note:</strong> The estimated legal costs were arrived at by consulting with both California and German counsel.

Similar to the other Maker RWA entities, RWAF serves as a vehicle through which Maker Governance can conduct activity in the RWA space.</p>\n<p>Currently, RWAF’s ability to make payments is limited by the lack of a bank account.

It believes DAI should remain stable, decentralized and uncensorable. Also that MKR holders should be rewarded. While we embrace complexity, our mantra is “Keep it simple, stupid!”</p>\n<p>The KISS AVC identifies the following two fundamental goals.</p>\n<p><strong>G1)</strong> DAI, the decentralized stablecoin, is the product of MakerDAO and its main focus. It must remain stable, decentralized, open to everybody and uncensorable.</p>\n<p><strong>G2)</strong> People with stake in the game are DAI holders and MKR holders. DAI holders rely on the key characteristics of DAI listed above. MKR holders have invested their own money in the project and must to be rewarded. The reward must be primarily financial but can also come in other forms: sense of stability and trust in the protocol, status, fulfillment, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>The KISS AVC wants to achieve the above two goals by:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A)</strong> Embrace complexity.<br>\nThe two goals above are extremely ambitious and require sophisticated and complex solutions. MakerDAO needs to attract and keep the best talents in order to succeed.</p>\n<p><strong>B)</strong> Strive for simplicity. But avoid “simplistic” solutions to complex problems.</p>\n<p>Attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”.</p>\n<p>Attributed to Albert Einstein: “Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler”.</p>\n<p><strong>C)</strong> Keep it simple stupid!

The Governance Facilitators observed this delayed update and determined that it did not meet the Atlas’ “actively communicating” standard due to the 6-week delay. The AD argued that the Atlas does not specify a strict time requirement for submitting vote communications and requested the decision be reconsidered.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"interpretation-and-outcome-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#interpretation-and-outcome-2\"></a>Interpretation and Outcome:</h2>\n<p>According to the Atlas, Aligned Delegates (ADs) must meet specific participation and communication requirements to qualify for compensation. These requirements are outlined in sections 2.6.3.6 and 2.6.3.8, which emphasize timely and active participation and communication.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"key-clauses-from-the-atlas-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#key-clauses-from-the-atlas-3\"></a>Key Clauses from the Atlas:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-3-6\"><strong>2.6.3.6:</strong></a><br>\nADs must participate in AVC Subcommittee Meetings to qualify for full income. Participation must be meaningful and contribute useful research and information, which implies that the timeliness and relevance of participation are critical.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-3-7\"><strong>2.6.3.7:</strong></a><br>\nVoting activity metrics modify AD income payouts, requiring a high level of consistent voting activity over the past 6 months.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-3-8\"><strong>2.6.3.8:</strong></a><br>\nCommunication metrics for the last 12 months are also crucial. ADs must actively communicate their voting rationale to maintain transparency and assist MKR holders in understanding governance decisions. Specifically, if an AD actively communicates on less than 95% of votes over the last 6 months, their income is reduced.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"interpretation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#interpretation-4\"></a>Interpretation:</h3>\n<p>The term “actively communicating” in the context of the Atlas implies that ADs must provide timely and relevant communication about their voting activities. This requirement ensures transparency and allows MKR holders to understand the rationale behind votes in a timely manner. While the Atlas does not specify an exact timeframe for submitting communications, it is implicit that these should be done within a reasonable period after the vote to be considered “active.”</p>\n<p>Based on the facts provided, adding communications for February votes in April does not meet the standard of “actively communicating.” A 6-week delay undermines the purpose of timely and transparent governance. Thus, such retroactive edits should not count toward future compensation calculations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"reasonable-timeframe-for-communication-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#reasonable-timeframe-for-communication-5\"></a>Reasonable Timeframe for Communication:</h4>\n<p>To clarify the expectations and prevent similar disputes, we suggest implementing a specific timeframe for submitting vote communications. A period of one week after the conclusion of a vote is reasonable for ADs to provide their explanations and align with the Atlas’ intent of active participation. This timeframe ensures that communications are timely, relevant, and useful for governance purposes.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"discretion-for-extenuating-circumstances-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#discretion-for-extenuating-circumstances-6\"></a>Discretion for Extenuating Circumstances:</h4>\n<p>While the one-week rule provides clear guidance, some discretion should be granted to Governance Facilitators to account for extenuating circumstances. For instance, delays caused by technical issues, calendar irregularities, or other significant impediments could warrant exceptions. Facilitators should evaluate such cases individually to determine if a delay is justified.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-7\"></a>Conclusion:</h3>\n<p>Editing or adding communications after a compensation period has ended should not count toward future compensation calculations. To maintain the integrity of the governance process, ADs must adhere to a one-week timeframe for submitting vote communications. Governance Facilitators should exercise discretion in exceptional cases but uphold the principle of timely and active communication as per the Atlas’ standards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"addendum-processing-expired-contracts-and-carryover-period-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#addendum-processing-expired-contracts-and-carryover-period-8\"></a>Addendum: Processing Expired Contracts and Carryover Period</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"context-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#context-9\"></a>Context:</h4>\n<p>There was an additional question when calculating compensation regarding how to handle expired delegate contracts and the MKR voting weight associated with them. Delegate contracts expire after one year, and sometimes MKR holders (delegators) do not immediately move their MKR to a new contract. This addendum provides guidance on how to process these expired contracts while maintaining compliance with the Atlas.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion:</h5>\n<p>To ensure a smooth transition and prevent unnecessary disruptions in governance participation, we will allow for a <strong>two-week carryover period</strong> when a delegate contract expires. During this period, the voting weight from expired contracts will continue to count towards a delegate’s vote weight for compensation calculations. This approach balances the need for continuity with adherence to the Atlas’ requirements.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"justification-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#justification-11\"></a>Justification:</h4>\n<h5><a name=\"h-263-aligned-delegate-income-and-participation-requirements-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-263-aligned-delegate-income-and-participation-requirements-12\"></a>2.6.3: Aligned Delegate Income and Participation Requirements</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>ADs are eligible to receive income based on their voting weight and participation. This eligibility is critical for maintaining active and aligned governance participation.</li>\n<li>Ensuring a short carryover period helps maintain the integrity of compensation calculations while accommodating the practicalities of transitioning MKR voting weight.</li>\n<li>Delegates with active delegators, who can respond within a short period of change, should not be punished based on the arbitrary expiration of contracts. Two weeks provides ample time for delegates to broadcast their new contracts while not substantially risky security assumptions of delegation.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Attention: <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/aligned_delegates\">@Aligned_Delegates</a> <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/avc_member\">@AVC_Member</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/le_bateleur\">@Le_Bateleur</a> <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/governance-reserve\">@Governance-Reserve</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-interpretation-communicating-votes-and-timeliness-for-delegate-compensation/24350\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-interpretation-communicating-votes-and-timeliness-for-delegate-compensation/24350","pubDate":"Thu, 23 May 2024 13:50:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24350"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-interpretation-communicating-votes-and-timeliness-for-delegate-compensation/24350.rss","#text":"Atlas Interpretation: Communicating Votes and Timeliness for Delegate Compensation"},"filter":false},{"title":"Smart Burn Engine - Vow.hump (Surplus Buffer Upper Limit) Reconfiguration Update #7","dc:creator":"rema","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h3><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h3>\n<p>According to the MIP102c2-SP34 which is currently being <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmPr9vBz\">polled</a> and more than likely to be ratified since it already has an overwhelming support by the delegates, the Smart Burn Engine Surplus Buffer Upper Limit parameter defined in <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp34-mip-amendment-subproposal/23971/2\">Stability Scope 9.1.1 in SP34</a> is being increased for 5m dai to the total of 55m dai.</p>\n<p>This parameter determines the minimum threshold for when the SBE can start transacting, meaning that the system will now maintain a higher surplus buffer.

The benefits include anonymity and broad community engagement, while the challenges involve managing anonymous interactions and ensuring positive community behavior. By applying insights from urban sociology, we may be able to develop effective strategies to address these challenges.\n<h2><a name=\"the-urban-framework-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#the-urban-framework-2\"></a>The urban framework</h2>\n<p>The essence of urban life, with its blend of anonymity and community, provides a valuable framework for understanding interactions within DAOs. Anonymity in digital spaces, akin to the walking down the street of a city, offers individuals the freedom to express themselves without the constraints of their offline identities. However, this anonymity can also lead to challenges, particularly when it concerns accountability and behavior in online communities.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"anonymity-as-freedom-and-challenge-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#anonymity-as-freedom-and-challenge-3\"></a>Anonymity as freedom and challenge</h2>\n<p>The city’s anonymity offers a sense of freedom, allowing individuals to interact without the constraints of their real-world identities. This can encourage open expression and innovation. However, as Danah Boyd, a researcher specializing in online community dynamics, points out, this same anonymity can also disrupt social dynamics. It can enable individuals to act in ways they might avoid if their true identities were known, leading to behavior that can be harmful or disruptive. Boyd notes that while removing anonymity might seem like a solution to these issues, such challenges are complex and are not likely to be resolved simply by exposing real identities, reflecting the nuanced impact of anonymity in digital spaces.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"implementing-urban-social-codes-in-daos-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#implementing-urban-social-codes-in-daos-4\"></a>Implementing urban social codes in DAOs</h2>\n<p>Urban sociology introduces the concept of “civil inattention,” which Irving Goffman describes as a social behavior that allows individuals to coexist peacefully in crowded environments by acknowledging each other’s presence respectfully without intruding into personal space. This concept can be invaluable in digital communities, where respectful engagement needs to be balanced with privacy and personal boundaries.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"civil-inattention-in-digital-spaces-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#civil-inattention-in-digital-spaces-5\"></a>Civil inattention in digital spaces</h2>\n<p>In DAOs, implementing a digital form of civil inattention could involve community guidelines built into the Atlas that promote respectful acknowledgment without unnecessary intrusion—encouraging members to interact within the bounds of digital etiquette. This approach could help in managing interactions that might otherwise escalate into conflicts due to misinterpretation or the perceived anonymity shield.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"community-engagement-and-governance-establishing-norms-in-the-atlas-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#community-engagement-and-governance-establishing-norms-in-the-atlas-6\"></a>Community engagement and governance: establishing norms in the Atlas</h2>\n<p>One of the primary concerns within DAOs revolves around determining which behaviors are considered harmful enough to warrant moderation or even a ban, like  - deliberate malicious behavior. This requires a nuanced understanding of the community’s values and the specific context of each interaction.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"establishing-behavioral-norms-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#establishing-behavioral-norms-7\"></a>Establishing behavioral norms</h2>\n<p>Community engagement must focus on delineating clear guidelines that define acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. These norms should not only discourage detrimental activities but also promote a positive, constructive dialogue that enhances the community’s overall fabric.</p>\n<p>Powerhouse / <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/wouter\">@wouter</a> is hopefully considering this as they are figuring out the reputation system, while Atlas Axis / <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/le_bateleur\">@Le_Bateleur</a> is dealing with the Atlas integration.</p>\n<p>To other community members reading along, lets start mapping malicious behaviour.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"encouraging-positive-engagement-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#encouraging-positive-engagement-8\"></a>Encouraging positive engagement</h2>\n<p>In our community, the anonymity that provides freedom can also, regrettably, be manipulated for less constructive purposes. Some people may use this veil of secrecy to create multiple accounts or amplify their own views in ways that do not reflect the true consensus of the community. Such actions not only skew honest dialogue but also threaten the integrity and trust.</p>\n<p>It’s important to recognize that while it is easier to critique and disrupt than to build and support, the lasting impact of our community depends on each of us choosing the harder right over the easier wrong. I urge all community members to embrace the responsibility that comes with anonymity — using it not as a shield for malice, but as a space for honest, respectful discourse.</p>\n<p>Let’s strive to ensure our interactions are guided by the principle of building up rather than tearing down.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/constructive-community-engagement/24344\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/constructive-community-engagement/24344","pubDate":"Wed, 22 May 2024 04:37:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24344"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/constructive-community-engagement/24344.rss","#text":"Constructive community engagement"},"filter":true},{"title":"Scammed -1,978.5031 spUSDC","dc:creator":"shimizuk1209","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Dear Maker DAO,</p>\n<p>I accessed the given address, connected my wallet, and verified the history of my previous transactions.

To give the community a better understanding of the potential of PureDai this explainer will outline some of the ideas and principles of how PureDai could be designed and implemented.</p>\n<p>Importantly, these are just preliminary thoughts and ideas, and as with everything in Endgame many parts of it will be changed and more knowledge becomes available and more contributors have provided their input. The basic design described here is mostly based on Rai, but it will be important to also study systems such as LUSDv2 and others to find more opportunities to make it more useful.</p>\n<p>Even though this is not a final specification and everything is subject to change, it is still useful to paint a picture of the possibilities of PureDai, and be more concrete about how and why it will be created, since there is so much interest in it.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-is-puredai-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#what-is-puredai-2\"></a>What is PureDai</h1>\n<p>The goal of PureDai is to deliver an idealized vision of Dai which has been desired by many Maker community OGs and broader ethereum cypherpunk visionaries and idealists.</p>\n<p>The changes ushered in by Endgame, as well as the specific development requirements of NewStable, mean it is now possible to deliver this vision with zero compromise. The result is PureDai.</p>\n<p>Zero compromise is the only proper way to approach decentralization as a maxim. Unless a stablecoin is going to go all the way and have no governance and only allow extremely decentralized collateral to back its stablecoin, ideological appeals to decentralization that ignore legal and real world realities are just theatrics, and actually make the system weaker rather than stronger.</p>\n<p>However if you go all the way, and accept what it takes to build a truly pure decentralized stablecoin, a sweet spot exists where combining all of the extreme decentralization measures without compromise actually produces an exceptionally resilient, reliable and simple stablecoin product that has many legitimate and interesting use cases.</p>\n<p>The main features of PureDai are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free-floating target price</li>\n<li>Only very decentralized, thoroughly proven collateral (ETH, STETH)</li>\n<li>Maximally decentralized oracles</li>\n<li>Minimal governance, no budgets, no contributors</li>\n<li>Permanently located on Ethereum Mainnet (L2’s, bridges maintained by the community)</li>\n<li>Simple tokenomics to promote stablecoin supply-side growth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The name PureDai is a placeholder, and it will be replaced with a high quality new brand and aesthetic that will be optimized to appeal to users that value extreme resilience, based on input from the community and future users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"free-floating-target-price-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#free-floating-target-price-3\"></a>Free floating target price</h1>\n<p>The most important feature is that PureDai must be able to enable a free-floating peg, as it cannot guarantee to maintain a peg with the USD long term, because there will not be access to large scale RWA in order to bring down the price in case of significantly more, persistent demand than supply.</p>\n<p>As such the possibility of a negative “target rate”, which results in the peg (“target price”) going down over time is necessary to ensure that the price can be kept stable. This is the mechanism that RAI, HAI and other similar decentralization-first stablecoins employ. In fact, these projects were inspired by Dai, because the original intention for the first several years of the Maker project was that Dai would be free-floating using this mechanism.</p>\n<p>Existing Dai users will never be affected by the free-floating price of PureDai, as Dai will remain pegged to the dollar, but they will have the option to upgrade their Dai to PureDai if they like the extreme levels of resilience and decentralization it achieves by making no compromises on its design tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>Advanced stablecoins such as LUSD are experimenting with methods that attempt to achieve a rough peg to USD that doesn’t require a free-floating traget price, while still enabling scalability. If it proves to work at large scale then PureDai may follow their lead and launch with a system that attempts to maintain a rough USD peg by leveraging some of the innovation of these advanced stablecoins.</p>\n<p>In all cases switching to free floating peg must always be a possibility and should be the default long term expectation of users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"only-very-decentralized-thoroughly-proven-collateral-initially-eth-steth-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#only-very-decentralized-thoroughly-proven-collateral-initially-eth-steth-4\"></a>Only very decentralized, thoroughly proven collateral (initially ETH, STETH)</h1>\n<p>The key to PureDai’s resilience will be its purely-decentralized, censorship- and seizure resistant collateral. Almost all crypto collateral has some kind of human component or reliance on legal or other real world infrastructure. However, ETH stands out as the ultimate decentralized collateral that is also programmable, and with Lido Staked ETH we have a very proven DAO and decentralized infrastructure for taking advantage of ETH staking, which makes it possible to also generate yield with ETH for better efficiency and economics.</p>\n<p>The minimal governance of PureDai would be able to offboard STETH, and potentially onboard other liquid staking ETH tokens that followed the high standard of PureDai collateral, if it ever became necessary.</p>\n<p>PureDai will be launched with a lending platform that has all must-have features for DeFi lending and borrowing, to maximize the amount of PureDai that will be generated.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"maximally-decentralized-oracles-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#maximally-decentralized-oracles-5\"></a>Maximally decentralized oracles</h1>\n<p>Unfortunately, even with all of the mechanics described it is still not possible to create a stablecoin that is 100% independent from anything external, but we can get very close. The one requirement that other designs such as RAI and LUSD also need is that they still require a stable reference asset - currently in most cases USD. We can leverage the resilience of NewStable to make a decentralized oracle system that is as strong as possible. To create the decentralized oracle, PureDai will need to maintain liquidity in three AMM pools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ETH/PureDai</li>\n<li>STETH/PureDai</li>\n<li>NewStable/PureDai</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A portion of the surplus income of the PureDai protocol will be funneled to these 3 AMM pools, to ensure they always scale in size with the system over time. The ETH and STETH AMMs are used to produce a time-weighted oracle price that determines the price of the collateral in the system for liquidation calculations. The NewStable/PureDai AMM is used to determine the target rate by figuring whether the day market price is above or below the target price.</p>\n<p>If NewStable fails or becomes too risky as a reference asset, the minimized governance of PureDai would be able to switch to a different oracle provider or a different Stablecoin to use in the AMM.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"puredai-governance-token-tokenomics-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#puredai-governance-token-tokenomics-6\"></a>PureDai Governance Token tokenomics</h1>\n<p>PureDai will have its own new governance token (PureDai Governance Token) with the following main characteristics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Genesis supply of 2 billion PureDai Governance Token</li>\n<li>Gensis supply distributed to NewStable farmers on Ethereum Mainnet over 5 years</li>\n<li>Permanent emissions to PureDai vaults users to subsidize PureDai generation</li>\n<li>Surplus from PureDai is used to accumulate the PureDai Governance Token with a Smart Burn Engine</li>\n<li>PureDai Governance Token acts as a backstop in case of bad debt in PureDai</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The genesis supply of 2 billion PureDai Governance Token will be distributed to NewStable users on Ethereum Mainnet, in a manner similar to how SubDAO token farming will work. The rate will be 400 million tokens per year for 5 years (subject to change). PureDai will not be a SubDAO though, as its own governance infrastructure will be fully independent from Maker, and there will be no permanent token emissions that benefit Maker.</p>\n<p>The PureDai Governance Token genesis emissions to NewStable help align the incentives of Maker in building and release PureDai, and also ensures that the ownership of PureDai Governance Tokens will be very broadly distributed with little barrier to entry, with no special interests group like MKR lockstakers or contributors.</p>\n<p>Having an additional valuable token with a clear purpose is a great boost to the growth and income potential of NewStable and Maker. The fact that Maker will benefit from developing and releasing a best-in-class pure decentralized Stablecoin is a strong incentive to make sure it will actually happen and it will be built whole-heartedly drawing on all the experience, processes and resources that Maker will have gained from launching multiple SubDAOs to deliver the best possible DeFi project of its particular niche. Successfully launching a fully independent and autonomous PureDai will not just be going through the motions.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"permanent-emissions-to-puredai-vaults-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#permanent-emissions-to-puredai-vaults-7\"></a>Permanent Emissions to PureDai Vaults</h1>\n<p>One mechanic to experiment with is inspired by the tokenomics of Maker Endgame. By providing permanent emissions to PureDai borrowers that use PureDai vaults to expand the PureDai supply, it may be possible to support a greater level of PureDai demand and growth without requiring a negative target rate.</p>\n<p>The solution would mean that there would be two options for all PureDai vaults, one option where the user just pay normal stability fees, and then a second option where they pay higher stability fees, but in return receive PureDai Governance Tokens.</p>\n<p>The yearly emissions for this could be in the range of 1-3% of total supply, but would have to be researched and modeled extensively, and also be based on observations from the Endgame Tokenomics.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"puredai-governance-token-burn-engine-and-backstop-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#puredai-governance-token-burn-engine-and-backstop-8\"></a>PureDai Governance Token Burn Engine and Backstop</h1>\n<p>Just like with Maker, PureDai would also use surplus to accumulate, market make and burn PureDai Governance Tokens. In case of bad debt arising from failed liquidation auctions exceeding the amount of PureDai accumulated in the PureDai Surplus Buffer, new PureDai Governance Tokens will be emitted to attempt to recapitalize the system, also just the same mechanism that exists in Maker today.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"interaction-with-subdaos-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#interaction-with-subdaos-9\"></a>Interaction with SubDAOs</h1>\n<p>Pure Decentralized Stablecoins that only use ETH and similar assets as collateral depend heavily on an efficient market to interact with them and arbitrage their inefficiencies. The SubDAO ecosystem will be well positioned to be users and build things on top of PureDai, to ensure it has plenty of legitimate usecases and to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities that occur in such a system.</p>\n<p>Spark in particular is likely to play a major role in PureDais growth and efficiency, as it has access to large amounts of ETH from the Spark Protocol.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#next-steps-10\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>PureDai may launch after the 3 first SubDAOs have launched, but the exact sequence and timing is likely to change. The launch will likely be several years out. Until the launch of PureDai it will be very helpful for the community to provide input on the forum about key features and characteristics of other cutting edge pure decentralized stablecoins, and especially observations about how their mechanics perform in the wild after being launched, so then when PureDai is launched it can have the best and most cutting edge design possible.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/puredai-returning-to-the-ideological-roots-of-dai/24293\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/puredai-returning-to-the-ideological-roots-of-dai/24293","pubDate":"Thu, 16 May 2024 20:57:54 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24293"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/puredai-returning-to-the-ideological-roots-of-dai/24293.rss","#text":"PureDai: Returning to the ideological roots of Dai"},"filter":false},{"title":"Reconciling the two opposing paths for Decentralized Stablecoins","dc:creator":"rune","category":"General Discussion","description":"<h1><a name=\"reconciling-the-two-opposing-paths-for-decentralized-stablecoins-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#reconciling-the-two-opposing-paths-for-decentralized-stablecoins-1\"></a>Reconciling the two opposing paths for Decentralized Stablecoins</h1>\n<p>From the moment Dai started scaling, it has been straddling two worlds.</p>\n<p>One world is the culture of pure decentralization as introduced with Bitcoin. The other is the desire to fulfill the original purpose of Dai, by delivering utility and value to real people at scale.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately these two worlds are fundamentally in friction with each other, as noted by the Stablecoin Trilemma, which states that achieving a dollar peg, maintaining pure decentralization, and scaling to large sizes simultaneously is not feasible.</p>\n<p>There are two main options for solving the Stablecoin Trilemma:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Prioritize Utility and Scale by choosing dollar peg + real world asset collateral, which requires integration with traditional finance (TradFi) and alignment with real world entities. Because utility and scalability are so fundamental for growth, it is almost impossible to find a major DeFi project that hasn’t made this tradeoff, or relies on stablecoins that have made this tradeoff. Decentralization is important everywhere it offers the best path towards practical resilience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take the path of pure decentralization and demand complete independence from centralized control and strict reliance on decentralized collateral. While conventional wisdom says that it is a lot harder to achieve significant growth when optimizing for decentralization above all else, the Maker community has always believed that there is potential in this approach, and that a natural legitimate userbase exists for this kind of stablecoin.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Endgame is an opportunity for the Maker community to execute decisively on realizing the full vision of both of these competing directions, without compromise, by doing them separately.</p>\n<p>This post describes changes to accomplish this. That will be introduced through a future proposal to edit the Maker Atlas, to be confirmed by a governance vote by MKR holders.</p>\n<p>The transition to the dual stablecoin solution should be a gradual, deliberate process over several years. Eventually, most Dai use cases will be succeeded by NewStable, which will focus on mass market adoption and regulatorily compliant Real-World Asset (RWA) backing, with decentralization used as a powerful tool to ensure transparency, resilience, and checks and balances.</p>\n<p>To complement NewStable, a second, purely decentralized stablecoin, called PureDai, will also be made available as an option for users who prefer the vision of pure decentralization.</p>\n<p>Holders of Dai will be able to upgrade to either of these options. The ability to upgrade from Dai to NewStable at a 1:1 basis will begin in the short term, while the option to upgrade from Dai to PureDai will follow at a later date. Dai will continue to function as today, and if in doubt Dai users can simply keep holding their Dai.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"newstable-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#newstable-2\"></a>NewStable</h1>\n<p>NewStable will be the main successor to Dai focused on growth, yield and resilience. As noted in previous Endgame posts, NewStable is a code name that will be dropped once the new branding is unveiled later this year.</p>\n<p>NewStable follows the trajectory Dai has taken and will focus on utility and adoption, with all of its features tailored towards this goal. NewStable will be a decentralized stablecoin that uses decentralization as a means to achieve practical ends, by making its governance and infrastructure as resilient and transparent as possible.</p>\n<p>NewStable will take over the RWA- and tradfi integrations of Dai, deepening and improving them, and making them more resilient over time through its resilient and decentralized governance processes and transparent infrastructure.</p>\n<p>NewStable will remain attached to Maker and gain the tokenomics, growth focus and governance features of Endgame.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"future-freeze-function-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#future-freeze-function-3\"></a>Future freeze function</h3>\n<p>To ensure NewStable can safely reach global scale, it will eventually be upgraded to have a freeze function similar to the industry standard of other major RWA-backed stablecoins. The freeze function will not be implemented in NewStable at launch, but the token will have upgradeability so that it can later be implemented by governance vote.</p>\n<p>Dai will remain as it is today with no possibility of adding a freeze function due to the technical immutability of its ERC-20 implementation.</p>\n<p>The future freeze function is generally expected to follow rule of law from jurisdictions where Maker needs a high level of certainty that the legal system will enforce recourse against RWA collateral. This will result in a much greater level of security, stability and reliability of using large scale RWA collateral for NewStable as it scales to global mass market adoption.</p>\n<p>The timeline for when the freeze function is implemented will likely be many months or even years, depending on the growth trajectory of NewStable. The future freeze function will be implemented in a way that leverages the decentralized governance and transparent processes of MakerDAO, to ensure it will be a risk-minimized process with checks and balances.</p>\n<p>A follow up post that details how the advantages of decentralized governance and infrastructure can be tapped into will be published later this week.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"dai-after-newstable-launch-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dai-after-newstable-launch-4\"></a>Dai after NewStable Launch</h1>\n<p>Dai users will be able to upgrade to NewStable during Launch Season as planned, however they can also choose to stay with Dai. Dai will remain as it is today with no possibility of adding a freeze function due to the technical immutability of its ERC-20 implementation.</p>\n<p>Dai will remain pegged to USD and will be upgradeable to NewStable any time the user wishes. It will also be possible to instantly reverse the process and convert any amount of NewStable to Dai. Dai will be used as a liquidity and integrations backend for NewStable, as NewStable apps and frontends can leverage the instant 1:1 Dai/NewStable conversion to provide better UX.</p>\n<p>After an initial transition period (the current estimate is at least 1 year), DSR will begin to be phased out by gradually ramping the rate down over time. Eventually, yield will only be available on NewStable.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"puredai-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#puredai-5\"></a>PureDai</h1>\n<p>Dai users in the future will have the option of upgrading their Dai to PureDai, which is a return to the ideological roots of Dai. PureDai will feature only purely decentralized collateral such as ETH and stETH, free-floating peg like Rai, maximally decentralized oracles and no governance or budgets.</p>\n<p>PureDai will be available after a few years, and will be released in its final, immutable form. From the moment it is released it will require no further upgrades or changes, and will be completely independent from Maker. The launch of PureDai will have similarities with the launch of the Initial SubDAOs, and will leverage tools and experience to help make it as successful as possible, but PureDai will be fundamentally different from a SubDAO as it will have no permanent connection to Maker once launched.</p>\n<p>Once PureDai is released, Dai users will be able to easily upgrade to it from the Maker frontends. PureDai will be deployed only on Ethereum mainnet, but L2’s and bridges may choose to support transporting it to other blockchains.</p>\n<p>PureDai will feature a new brand that is optimized for communicating the specific, unique value proposition of PureDai. Until the rebrand is unveiled in advance of the launch of the finished PureDai system, PureDai is used as a temporary placeholder name.</p>\n<p>A follow-up post that goes into detail about the preliminary specification of PureDai will be posted later this week.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-happens-to-dai-in-the-long-term-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#what-happens-to-dai-in-the-long-term-6\"></a>What happens to Dai in the long term?</h1>\n<p>After the launch of PureDai, Dai users will have two complementary choices available to them: They can upgrade to NewStable and take advantage of its USD peg and yield features, or they can upgrade to PureDai to gain the advantages of its fully decentralized collateral.</p>\n<p>Eventually, after multiple years, it is expected that Dai will be fully deprecated as all users and integrations migrate to either NewStable or PureDai. The timeline for when this happens will depend on how quickly the ecosystem adopts NewStable and PureDai.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"what-happens-to-mkr-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#what-happens-to-mkr-7\"></a>What happens to MKR?</h1>\n<p>As communicated in earlier Endgame Posts, MKR will stay around and be attached to MakerDAO as it rebrands and Launch Season begins. MKR holders will have the option to upgrade to NewGovToken at a ratio of 1:24,000. It will also be possible to convert NewGovToken to MKR, reversing the process.</p>\n<p>MKR holders can choose to keep holding their MKR, as the new features of NewGovToken also apply to MKR. It will be possible to use the LockStake Engine directly with MKR without having to upgrade to NewGovToken.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"upcoming-explainers-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#upcoming-explainers-8\"></a>Upcoming explainers</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Thursday there will be a follow-up post containing a deep dive on PureDai, with its current specification. The specification is relatively simple, and of course will be subject to change, but will still provide a good overview of the principles at this stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Friday there will be a follow-up post providing more context about the principles and ideas for how decentralized governance and the advanced governance capabilities of Maker Endgame can be leveraged to make a more transparent and more fair stablecoin freeze function process.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>21 posts - 10 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/reconciling-the-two-opposing-paths-for-decentralized-stablecoins/24280\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/reconciling-the-two-opposing-paths-for-decentralized-stablecoins/24280","pubDate":"Wed, 15 May 2024 16:09:49 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24280"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/reconciling-the-two-opposing-paths-for-decentralized-stablecoins/24280.rss","#text":"Reconciling the two opposing paths for Decentralized Stablecoins"},"filter":false},{"title":"April 2024 Aligned Delegate Compensation","dc:creator":"JanSky","category":"Alignment Conservers","description":"<h1><a name=\"april-2024-aligned-delegate-compensation-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#april-2024-aligned-delegate-compensation-1\"></a>April 2024 Aligned Delegate Compensation</h1>\n<p>This forum post is the official record of Aligned Delegate compensation for April 2024.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"april-compensation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#april-compensation-2\"></a>April Compensation</h2>\n<p>The total payment amount is defined in the Atlas and Governance Scope as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NewGovToken amount being distributed to PDs and RDs are 60 million and 20 million respectively.</li>\n<li>Ratio of MKR:NewGovToken is 1:24,000.</li>\n<li>The number of slots for each type of delegate is 4.</li>\n<li>A temporary reduction in payment amounts to Prime and Reserve Delegates of 20%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on this, Prime Delegates may earn up to <strong>41.67</strong> (<code>60,000,000 * 1/12 * 1/4 * 1/24000 * 4/5</code>) MKR per month, and Reserve Delegates up to <strong>13.89</strong> (<code>20,000,000 * 1/12 * 1/4 * 1/24000 * 4/5</code>) MKR per month.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"prime-delegates-throughout-the-month-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#prime-delegates-throughout-the-month-3\"></a>Prime Delegates Throughout the Month</h2>\n<p>The following ADs served as Prime Delegates for the duration of March, and the top 4 PDs by MKR will continue as PDs at the beginning of May:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BLUE</li>\n<li>Cloaky</li>\n<li>JuliaChang</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TRUE NAME held the position of Prime Delegate for the first 5 days of the month, until their derecognition was posted.

In the past weeks since the recent rate cuts, main development is in the external rate environment which has notably dropped, including the defi protocols and cefi funding rates. Main impact on the internal system had thus been an increase in DAI supply and stablecoin reserves which is a product of DSR being very attractive rate and positions being refinanced to cheaper alternatives across defi space.</p>\n<p>On March 8, 2024, article 3.3 in the Stability Scope was enacted by the Stability Facilitators by initiating an accelerated governance cycle to implement non-standard changes to the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), Stability Fees (SFs) of Maker Core Vaults, and the Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY.</p>\n<p>Since then, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> has been following market developments and Maker Protocol dynamics closely. We have provided regular data, analyses, and parameter change proposals, with the main goal of aiding Maker Governance in navigating protocol and market changes and managing Stability Scope parameters.</p>\n<p>For an overview of <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> work regarding Stability Scope parameter change proposals and protocol dynamic analyses since the March 8 Accelerated Proposal, refer to the links below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-8-accelerated-proposal/23909\">Impact Analysis: March 8 Accelerated Proposal (March 20, 2024)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-11-under-sta-article-3-3/23910\">Stability Scope Parameter Changes #11; Under STA Article 3.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-20-parameter-change-proposal/24131\">Impact Analysis: March 20 Parameter Change Proposal (April 19, 2024)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-12-under-sta-article-3-3/24132\">Stability Scope Parameter Changes #12; Under STA Article 3.3</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"maker-exposure-trends-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#maker-exposure-trends-2\"></a>Maker Exposure Trends</h2>\n<p>The area chart below measures DAI debt exposure distribution over time.

This, in turn, resulted in more capital being deployed to Cash RWA since the target Cash Stablecoin exposure has exceeded the 30% threshold.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e272166d12b48f6273185fda53ba732e67f43bca.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wjel4vb7ePqN7vXFjaWtfHHZmMG.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e272166d12b48f6273185fda53ba732e67f43bca_2_624x267.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"wjel4vb7ePqN7vXFjaWtfHHZmMG\" width=\"624\" height=\"267\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e272166d12b48f6273185fda53ba732e67f43bca_2_624x267.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/e/2/e272166d12b48f6273185fda53ba732e67f43bca_2_936x400.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/2/e272166d12b48f6273185fda53ba732e67f43bca.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DFC9DF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/\">Makerburn</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"dsr-changes-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dsr-changes-3\"></a>DSR Changes</h2>\n<p>As seen in the chart below, over the last few months, there has been an upward trend of DAI in the DSR. The DSR utilization is currently at 38.1%. Since the main source of new DAI is from PSM, which is then deposited into the DSR, the protocol profit generation has been decreasing. This will likely change assuming this proposal is implemented, since crypto lending will become more attractive which will likely result in increased exposure, which yields more compared to Coinbase Custody and Cash RWA.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/9/190c7845166e7b36c78dc67d4502de140f5a7851.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3zAEuSizj0OnOikZ69lpryXh0BP.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/190c7845166e7b36c78dc67d4502de140f5a7851_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"3zAEuSizj0OnOikZ69lpryXh0BP\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/190c7845166e7b36c78dc67d4502de140f5a7851_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/9/190c7845166e7b36c78dc67d4502de140f5a7851_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/1/9/190c7845166e7b36c78dc67d4502de140f5a7851.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/\">Makerburn</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"external-rates-environment-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#external-rates-environment-4\"></a>External Rates Environment</h2>\n<p>As seen on the charts below, the cefi funding rates and defi borrowing rates are in a downward trend which will likely remain until market sentiment changes and price dynamic starts to increase.

Until then, the rates will be managed out-of-scope under the Stability Scope article 3.3.</p>\n<p>Additionally the latest <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-spxx-mip-amendment-subproposal/23971\">MIP102-SP proposal</a> which was formally submitted attempts to allow the rate changes to be proposed by the Stability Facilitator based on the recommendation of the Advisory Council without the need of using article 3.3., until the aforementioned rate system is implemented.</p>\n<p>Given that the current DSR is very attractive and that borrowing rates across crypto lending engines are above the external rate environment, BA Labs believes that a general rate cut is necessary.</p>\n<p>BA Labs recommends the Stability Facilitator to perform the following parameter changes to the Maker rate system, which can go directly to the upcoming executive vote according to the language of the Stability Scope article 3.3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ETH-A: Decrease the Stability Fee by 2 percentage points from 10.25% to 8.25%</li>\n<li>ETH-B: Decrease the Stability Fee by 2 percentage points from 10.75% to 8.75%</li>\n<li>ETH-C: Decrease the Stability Fee by 2 percentage points from 10.00% to 8.00%</li>\n<li>WSTETH-A: Decrease the Stability Fee by 2 percentage points from 11.25% to 9.25%</li>\n<li>WSTETH-B: Decrease the Stability Fee by 2 percentage points from 11.00% to 9.00%</li>\n<li>WBTC-A: Decrease the Stability Fee by 2 percentage points from 11.75% to 9.75%</li>\n<li>WBTC-B: Decrease the Stability Fee by 2 percentage points from 12.25% to 10.25%</li>\n<li>WBTC-C: Decrease the Stability Fee by 2 percentage points from 11.50% to 9.50%</li>\n<li>Spark: Decrease the Effective DAI Borrow Rate by 2 percentage points from 11.00% to 9.00%</li>\n<li>DSR: Decrease the Dai Savings Rate by 2 percentage points from 10.00% to 8.00%</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/3/935e3ac2c4270be39b58c8939f06d3c3acfd8975.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/l1G4AsPR5iQjC82sGRIa32mIDXf.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/3/935e3ac2c4270be39b58c8939f06d3c3acfd8975_2_624x397.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"l1G4AsPR5iQjC82sGRIa32mIDXf\" width=\"624\" height=\"397\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/3/935e3ac2c4270be39b58c8939f06d3c3acfd8975_2_624x397.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/3/935e3ac2c4270be39b58c8939f06d3c3acfd8975_2_936x595.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/3/935e3ac2c4270be39b58c8939f06d3c3acfd8975_2_1248x794.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D9D6D6\"></a></div><p></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-13-under-sta-article-3-3/24250\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-13-under-sta-article-3-3/24250","pubDate":"Fri, 10 May 2024 13:18:46 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24250"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-13-under-sta-article-3-3/24250.rss","#text":"Stability Scope Parameter Changes #13;

The whitehat hacker demonstrated it was possible to force a blank page to be stored into the CDN cache for a given URL in the Governance Portal, which could lead to some or all of the Governance Portal pages being inaccessible by the users, depending of the extent to which the vulnerability could have been exploited.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"actions-taken-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#actions-taken-2\"></a>Actions taken</h2>\n<p>Upon receiving the report we started a root cause analysis between TechOps and Jetstream, with the goal of better understanding the attack vector and potential mitigation steps.</p>\n<p>During the investigation phase we found that the vulnerability was unusual in nature, given that we were unable to find documentation on similar cases. It also proved difficult to assess whether the root cause was related to the frontend application code or its hosting infrastructure configuration such as CDN provider. As a result it took us longer than usual to identify a root cause, despite back-and-forth with the whitehat hacker. Given that no user and protocol funds were at risk and the whitehat hacker was willing to collaborate, we took over a week to find consensus on mitigation steps and implement them accordingly. The process involved multiple internal escalations, outreach to various software/infra vendors, testing various fixes and discussion with the whitehat hacker.</p>\n<p>On April 19th we marked the vulnerability report as valid, but did contest the ‘critical severity’ label. Immunefi’s mediation team ended up investigating the report and related discourse, with the outcome of the report being indeed of critical severity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"improvements-implemented-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#improvements-implemented-3\"></a>Improvements implemented</h2>\n<p>Jetstream implemented several improvements to enhance application (Governance Portal) security, particularly related to headers. One enhancement involved modifying the middleware to ensure that only request headers are returned in the NextResponse.next.request object. This adjustment streamlines header management, improving efficiency and reducing potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, Jetstream refined the response headers by removing request headers from them entirely. Now, the response headers solely contain the Content Security Policy (CSP).</p>\n<p>TechOps implemented a worker (specific software) for the infrastructure that rewrites and removes unnecessary headers from all requests coming to specific endpoints thus making it impossible to bring down the Governance Portal sending corrupted requests.</p>\n<p>This change has been implemented for all MakerDAO websites and subdomains that are managed and controlled by TechOps Services EA.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"planned-improvements-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#planned-improvements-4\"></a>Planned improvements</h2>\n<p>In addition to the fixes that have already been implemented, there are a couple of improvements that we agreed to make. They are mainly related to the process of reporting, escalating and trying to avoid bottlenecks whenever high priority bug issues are reported:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve the inbound process of the bug bounty program through a more granular definition of system component stewards.</li>\n<li>Automate notification and alerting process, facilitating fast response.</li>\n<li>Narrow the scope of ‘critical’ web application bugs by improving its definition as part of the bug bounty program terms.</li>\n<li>More granularly define what’s considered out-of-scope for the bug bounty program.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"closing-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#closing-5\"></a>Closing</h2>\n<p>Based on the above we authorize <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/psychonaut\">@psychonaut</a> (as steward of the bug bounty program) to proceed with the bounty payout.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/jetstream-ea\">@jetstream-ea</a> and <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/techops-services-ea\">@techops-services-ea</a> teams for collaborating on the issues and making it possible to resolve it in a proper manner.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/post-mortem-for-immunefi-bug-report-29806/24239\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/post-mortem-for-immunefi-bug-report-29806/24239","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 10:09:25 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"Yes","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24239"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/post-mortem-for-immunefi-bug-report-29806/24239.rss","#text":"Post-Mortem for Immunefi bug report #29806"},"filter":false},{"title":"BlockTower Credit - Monthly Report (04/1/24 - 04/30/24)","dc:creator":"BlockTower","category":"General Discussion","description":"<h3><a name=\"preamble-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#preamble-1\"></a>Preamble</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">Title: BlockTower Credit Monthly Arranger Report\nPeriod: 03/31/2024- 04/30/2024\nPosted: 05/07/2024\nAuthor: @BlockTower\nTags: @Recognized-Delegates @Aes @roo\nIlks: RWA012-A, RWA013-A\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a name=\"references-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#references-2\"></a>References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-collateral-onboarding-application-blocktower-credit-arranger/16900/1\">BlockTower Credit (Arranger) Collateral Onboarding Application</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocktower-credit-commercial-and-legal-risk-assessment-part-i/18790\">BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part I</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocktower-credit-commercial-and-legal-risk-assessment-part-ii/18791\">BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part II</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-blocktower-credit-transaction-documents/19019\">BlockTower Credit Legal Transaction Documents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"executive-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#executive-summary-3\"></a>Executive Summary</h3>\n<p>During this reporting period, we sourced and settled 3 new assets.

Cohort Analysis</h1>\n<p>In the following analysis, we classify wallets by their cohort month, which groups those who first interacted with the protocol in the same month. The Cohort tenure metric is defined as the number of months since a wallet’s cohort month (1 represents the first month, 2 the second, and so forth). It is important to consider that all the cohorts from May 2023 to November 2023 have been grouped together in the November Cohort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conservative-growth-patterns-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conservative-growth-patterns-3\"></a>Conservative growth patterns</h2>\n<p>After reaching the peak of supplied amounts in February 2024 (~$4.1B), the total supply has been falling since then to reach ~$2.8B in April 2024 (Chart 1). The main reason why the total supply has been dropping is the down market we are currently witnessing, with BTC price falling by ~14% from its peak and ETH falling by ~20% from its peak. The pattern is slightly different from total borrows (Chart 4), that have reached their peak in March 2024 (~$1.65B) and plunged to ~$1.2B in April 2024.</p>\n<p>While this metric alone is not enough to provide an overall assessment of the protocol’s growth, the remaining ones give a clearer picture of SparkLend’s status. Since January 2024, the new cohorts have been supplying less amounts as percentage of total supplies (Chart 2). This is due to two main factors, (i) the positive retention patterns of the May-November cohort and (ii) the decreasing number of new wallets opening positions on SparkLend (Chart 7).</p>\n<p>In contrast with the previous analysis, we can see that the number of new wallets is decreasing steadily since January. This may be due to (i) the down market not attracting new users to DeFi protocols or (ii) SparkLend being less attractive compared to other Blue-Chip lending markets. We can see that up to date, supplied and borrowed amounts have been dropping in the range of 40% - 60% for new cohorts (Charts 3 and 6).</p>\n<p>With the exception of the February cohort, the Large wallets dominance per cohort tenure has been steady for each individual cohort (Chart 8).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"supplied-and-borrowed-amounts-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#supplied-and-borrowed-amounts-4\"></a>Supplied and borrowed amounts</h2>\n<p>Regarding total amounts supplied in April 2024, $423M (or 15.2%) came from the February cohort, followed by the March (7.9%) and the January ones (7.4%), with respectively $219M and $206M. Except for the May-November cohort (+26%) all new cohorts’ supplied amounts have been dropping, such as January (-63%), February (-46%) and March (-42%).</p>\n<p>The largest cohorts by amount supplied are the same cohorts dominating borrowing, with March borrowing $125M (10.3%), February borrowing $109M (9%) and January still borrowing $87M (7.3%). The January and February cohorts are the ones that dropped the most, both down 60% since they started using SparkLend.</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the cohorts.</p>\n\nChart 1.

Segmentation Analysis</h1>\n<p>The segmentation analysis conducted was primarily focused on assessing what types of positions/strategies SparkLend users are deploying. In order to understand how they were calculated, refer to the previously conducted Segmentation Analysis. To summarize briefly, here are the identified segments:</p>\n\nIdentified Segments <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h2><a name=\"still-bullish-sentiment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#still-bullish-sentiment-6\"></a>(Still) Bullish sentiment</h2>\n<p>In the last analysis, we used individual wallet positions to assess the sentiment of SparkLend users towards the crypto market. It is very interesting to note that most wallets are still exhibiting bullish behavior, with the largest positions being Long ETH LST ($1.5B) and Long Type 1 ($510M), together accounting for ~73% of the total supply in April (Charts 9 and 10). The third-largest position is the Recursive ETH LST (~$495M), roughly ~18% of total. It is also worth noting that the wallets in the highest supply bucket (&gt;$100M) all have long positions (Chart 12).</p>\n<p>Short positions have dropped consistently in March and April (now totaling ~$8.5M) down significantly from February when they were ~$93M. They are now ~0.3% of total supply, consistently dropping from their December 2023 peak, when they were ~4%.</p>\n<p>The wallet count per position strategy (Chart 11) highlights a predominance of ETH and (w)BTC long positions (483) as well as long ETH LST (167). There are only 10 wallets displaying strictly short strategies. On average, wallets in the lower supply amount buckets tend to have long ETH/(w)BTC positions, while those in the higher tend to have larger Long ETH LST positions. The strategies dominated by large wallets (Chart 14) are Short Type 1, Supply Only Stablecoins and recursive ETH LST. This is mainly due to a low number of wallets employing these strategies.</p>\n<p>A comparison between the current state of health rates (Chart 16) and the previous analysis shows Recursive ETH LST having lower debt-weighted health rates (down from 1.09 on 1 March to 1.02 on 1 May). On the other hand, Short strategies have a slightly higher health rate (1.52 vs. 1.42) as well as Long ETH LST (2.15 vs. 2.08).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"behavioral-analysis-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#behavioral-analysis-7\"></a>Behavioral analysis</h2>\n<p>Interesting insights can be drawn from how users are interacting with the protocol. First of all, the need for active management can be predominantly seen in Short Type 1 and Diversified Borrower segments, as well as the Recursive ETH LST (Chart 17), which by definition would need to continuously adjust to market conditions. We can also see that, on average, a high number of events are performed by wallets with lowest and highest health rate (Chart 18), while average health rates on average perform fewer actions. This can indicate that those in these categories must execute more actions to maintain their strategies. There is also a positive relation between how much users supply to the protocol and the number of actions they perform (Chart 19), meaning that the more someone supplies, the more likely they are to execute more actions.</p>\n<p>This distribution highlights a behavioral tendency towards active management in strategies perceived as higher risk, evidenced by the need for more events per month and a lower health rate associated with short positions and recursive ETH LST strategies. Particularly, a wallet in the “Other” category performed the highest amount of actions in a month (39).</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the segments.</p>\n\nChart 9: Supply Amount Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 10: Percentage Supply Amount Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 11: Wallet Count Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 12: Percentage Supply Amount Per Supply Amount Bucket <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 13: Wallet Count Per Supply Amount Bucket <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 14: Top 10 Large Wallet Supply Percentage Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 15: Borrow Per Health Rate <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 16: Debt-Weighted Health Rate Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 17: Events Per Month Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 18: Events Per Month Per Health Rate <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 19: Events Per Month vs Supply Amount <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-external-capital-analysis-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-3-external-capital-analysis-8\"></a>3. External Capital Analysis</h1>\n<p>The aim of this analysis is assessing how SparkLend users are behaving outside SparkLend, through an assessment on the external capital held and their cross-protocol usage. We define as external capital as the assets held outside the protocol that could be used to protect individual positions. External capital can either be passive (idle in the wallet) or active (used in other protocols). The data refers to a snapshot taken on 1 May.</p>\n<p>In total, SparkLend users are holding approximately $5.8B in other protocols (Chart 20), $1.35B of which is in Maker (~24% of total). Looking at other lending protocols, $135M is supplied on Compound v3 and 354M on Aave v3, (30% up from 1 March). Other important protocols used by SparkLend wallets are Lido, Stakefish, and Morpho Aave. Together, Morpho AAVE (v1 and v3) has a supply from SparkLend users of ~$635M across 33 wallets.</p>\n<p>By looking at the passive external capital per asset (Chart 21), we can see that users hold WBTC ($147M), GNO ($143M), WETH ($94M), and MKR ($84M) with sDAI raising its popularity from the previous analysis ($60M from $51M). There are 1063 wallets that hold ETH idle, as well as USDC (303 wallets), and DAI (330 wallets). The other stablecoins are falling behind DAI and USDC, with USDT ($16M, 168 wallets), USDe ($11M, 71 wallets) and sUSDe ($8M, 12 wallets). Next, we assess the passive external capital relative to debt (Chart 22) and we can see that 55.8% of users have enough passive external capital to cover 25% of their debt, while 10.1% have a buffer of more than 500%. In general, 27.5% of wallets have enough external capital to cover the total debt exposure.</p>\n<p>What would require more attention is the current passive external capital as percentage of debt (Chart 23), since 83.6% of total debt (up from 78.6% on 1 March) is covered by only 25% of capital held in wallets, which was previously 66.2% in December and 78.6% in March. In case of price drops or changing market conditions, this might have negative effects over the protocol’s health. On the other hand, 9.8% of total debt is fully collateralized by capital held in wallets (down from 18.8% on 1 March). Looking at the 50 largest wallets (Chart 24), we can see that on average they have less passive external capital compared to their debt positions, with only 12% of them having enough to cover their debt.</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the external dynamics.</p>\n\nChart 20: Wallets' Active External Capital Per Protocol <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 21: Wallets' Passive External Capital Per Asset <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 22: Wallets' Passive External Capital Over SparkLend Borrow (Percentage of Wallets) <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 23: Wallets' Passive External Capital Over SparkLend Borrow (Percentage of Debt) <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 24: Large Wallets' Passive External Capital vs Protocol Borrow <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-9\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The current analysis highlights a more conservative growth pattern for SparkLend during the observed period. While the protocol continues to attract user interaction, the decrease in total supplied and borrowed amounts across the cohorts suggests a cautious approach by users in response to market downturns and/or the protocol’s attractiveness. This shift is marked by a significant reduction in the engagement of new cohorts and a stronger retention within earlier cohorts, indicating a reliance on established users through less favorable market conditions.</p>\n<p>The segmentation analysis reveals that despite a broader market downturn, a significant portion of SparkLend users maintain bullish sentiment, particularly in long positions with substantial investments in ETH LST and Type 1 assets. At the same time, the significant drop in short positions reflects a withdrawal from riskier strategies, aligning with the overall conservative trend observed in the cohort analysis. This behavior suggests that while SparkLend users continue to use the protocol, there is a tangible shift towards safety in response to market volatility.</p>\n<p>In terms of external dynamics, the analysis highlights a robust interaction with other protocols, although there’s an increase in passive external capital relative to debt, which could pose a risk in adverse market shifts. This condition requires a more detailed monitoring of capital buffers to prevent potential liquidations, especially in a volatile market.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"future-work-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#future-work-10\"></a>Future Work</h1>\n<p>BA Labs plans to keep monitoring user metrics to ensure the protocol’s stability, by further providing quarterly analyses on the most important dynamics and suggestions on how to tackle potential issues. At the same time, we plan to automate this kind of analyses in order to get live data on user behavior to promptly respond to changing market conditions.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236","pubDate":"Tue, 07 May 2024 13:56:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24236"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-2/24236.rss","#text":"Sparklend User Metrics & Growth Analysis - Report #2"},"filter":true},{"title":"Update for AVC Members Regarding Governance Proposal","dc:creator":"votewizard","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>Hello Maker community,</p>\n<p>I’d like to provide an update regarding the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-spxx-mip-amendment-subproposal/23971\">governance proposal</a> that may bring changes to the governance structure and impact the AVC members.

Beware!","dc:creator":"Murakami","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Hello everybody!</p>\n<p>I’m a contributor that was victim of a scam where I lost DAI.</p>\n<p>This post is to inform and warn other community members from doing the same mistake.</p>\n<p>The following is the sequence of events that resulted in the scam:</p>\n<p>I noticed in my MetaMask wallet in the transaction history that there was a ‘Contract Call’ that I didn’t recognize. I checked the transaction on Etherscan and found that it was linked to <a href=\"http://origindollar.net\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">origindollar.net</a>.</p>\n<p>Contract Call: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x91858c18dadab1ea0a8b83b6acd17d558fd7c3716d0e4bc21503722cc891cbea\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://etherscan.io/tx/0x91858c18dadab1ea0a8b83b6acd17d558fd7c3716d0e4bc21503722cc891cbea</a></p>\n<p>I searched the internet for <a href=\"http://origindollar.net\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">origindollar.net</a> to verify if it was a scam or a legit crypto entity and after I read that Origindollar was mentioned in some topics on the forum and I saw the OUSD token on coinmarketcap, I assessed that it was legit.</p>\n<p>On the <a href=\"http://origindollar.net\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">origindollar.net</a>, you can connect your wallet to see if you are eligible for an airdrop. After I approved and connected my wallet to the site, the site stated that I was not eligible for an airdrop and when I went to look at my wallet, all the DAI in my wallet was sent to another address.</p>\n<p>I thought I was approving connectivity between my wallet and <a href=\"http://origindollar.net\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">origindollar.net</a>, but I actually approved an outgoing transaction of all the DAI to another address.</p>\n<p>Transaction of the scam: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1b59d911f9a1b5a59a4d311d12a8ac9167af3ecb504080d0ee70e49fbbdcd01c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1b59d911f9a1b5a59a4d311d12a8ac9167af3ecb504080d0ee70e49fbbdcd01c</a></p>\n<p>On the etherscan, you can see that the recipient has changed its address’s name tag to<br>\n“Maker: Dai Stablecoin” to fool the victim.</p>\n<p>The message with this post is to make community members aware of scams like this. Be absolutely sure of everything you approve of in regards to third-party applications, transactions or entities that can gain access to your wallet.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/losing-dai-to-a-scam-beware/24228\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/losing-dai-to-a-scam-beware/24228","pubDate":"Mon, 06 May 2024 15:08:46 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24228"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/losing-dai-to-a-scam-beware/24228.rss","#text":"Losing DAI to a scam.
