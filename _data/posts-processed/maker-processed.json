Following LB’s transition to his new EA role at Atlas Axis, where he has been doing an excellent job, I, along with blimpa, have assumed his responsibilities. Although finding a suitable replacement proved challenging, I am now thrilled to announce the onboarding of two dedicated full-time contributors, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/civicsage\">@CivicSage</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/boet\">@boet</a>, who have been training with us over the past two months.</p>\n<p>CivicSage will be undertaking responsibilities similar to those previously held by LB. He will enhance the redundancy within EE, ensuring continuity of service even in my absence. His role will encompass coordination and drafting of polls and executive votes, emergency management, governance administration (including ADs and AVCs onboarding/offboarding and compensation calculations), interpretation of the Atlas, arbitration of conflicts within the Dao, and enforcement of alignment.</p>\n<p>boet and their team will be providing technical services, which include automating workflows, calculating compensation, conducting operational security and on-chain investigations, reviewing spells code, and monitoring and updating governance metrics. They will also assist in general support tasks across the team.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/blimpa\">@blimpa</a> has been assisting me with the drafting of Exec Copy and Exec polls and will continue to contribute significantly in these areas. He will also manage community requests, oversee the MIP process, handle ratification polls and related GitHub PRs, and support the team in various capacities. His efforts are truly appreciated, and I’m grateful for his dedication.</p>\n<p>Both <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/civicsage\">@CivicSage</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/boet\">@boet</a> are currently in a testing period. Their performance has been promising, and we expect it to enhance further as they gain more experience and continue to demonstrate their proficiency and commitment.</p>\n<p>For transparency, I also wish to inform you that I will be transferring compensation to cover their training period.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I want to publicly thank <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/navigator\">@Navigator</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/0xdefensor\">@0xDefensor</a> for their prompt responses, assistance, and participation in last month’s <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/accelerated-proposal-rate-system-gsm-delay-psm-usdc-a-ttl-changes/23824\">Accelerated Proposal</a>.

The debt ceiling for this vault is at zero, Drop redemptions have been submitted, and there are no additional actions for Maker to take at this time.</p>\n<p>This loan remains backed by a portfolio of Revenue Based Financing assets, in which each asset is a loan to a business (typically a small business or SaaS company), itself collateralized by a percentage of that business’s gross revenues.</p>\n<p>Fortunafi is failing a number of covenants: the co-investor ratio (now almost at zero), the YoY growth rate, and the minimum Fortunafi Tin investment (however, there are two additional affiliated entities which own Tin tokens, and if included, these would increase the ownership percentage above that covenant’s threshold). As mentioned above, the minimum tin percentage is also failing.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"harbor-trade-rwa-004-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#harbor-trade-rwa-004-9\"></a>Harbor Trade (RWA-004)</h2>\n<p>The Harbor Trade transaction still has 1.5mm Dai outstanding from the vault as of the end of September, and the workout process for the portfolio is ongoing.

It features novel technological features built into its blockchain. Namely, Twin-Turbo Consensus and transaction parallelization, which increase transaction efficiency and throughput. Since launching its mainnet in August 2023, Sei has seen an ecosystem of native projects launch and a community emerge. To maintain momentum, Sei must successfully deploy the features planned for the Sei V2 upgrade. EVM compatibility could unlock new opportunities by expanding Sei’s developer ecosystem and enabling established EVM protocols to deploy on Sei. Optimistic transaction parallelization will ease the developer experience, while SeiDB improves the network’s performance across the board. Post-V2, sights can be set on the Parallel Stack. The stack could enable further growth in Sei’s ecosystem and validator usage as Layer-2 EVM rollups are launched by developers seeking an improved user experience and novel design space. All these planned features could lead to more activity on the network as it continues to mature and differentiate itself from other competing Layer-1 networks.</p>\n<p><strong>Optimistic Parallelization.</strong></p>\n<p>To further elaborate on the execution environment, we must highlight Sei’s rollout of optimistic parallelization. By enabling transactions to be processed in parallel rather than sequentially, Sei v2 enables significantly increased throughput and reduced transactions fees. This architecture diverges from traditional, sequential blockchain processing seen traditionally with the EVM, where transactions are confirmed one after another, leading to potential bottlenecks as the network’s usage grows. Sequential transactions therefore present anti-network effects–parallelization alleviates such growing pains.</p>\n<p><em>Key Numbers</em>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork/status/1770159112866963540?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork/status/1770159112866963540?s=20</a></p>\n<p>Sei v2 utilizes optimistic parallelization, where transactions are processed in parallel under the assumption that they will not conflict or interfere with each other’s state changes. This approach optimistically assumes that concurrent transactions can access and modify the blockchain state without creating inconsistencies. If conflict arises, then sequential re-execution of the transactions is needed. Deterministic execution requires developers to assign the parts of state that can be accessed, but these assignments require more developer overhead.</p>\n<p><em>To learn more about it</em>: <a href=\"https://forum.sei.io/t/optimistic-concurrency-control/28?ref=blog.sei.io\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimistic Concurrency Control - Standards and RFCs - Sei Developer Forum</a></p>\n<p><strong>What is SeiDB?</strong></p>\n<p>More transactions also means more problems, specifically around state management. If a blockchain cannot effectively manage high throughput at the state/storage level, it encounters another bottleneck. This undermines the advantages initially gained from employing a parallel execution environment.</p>\n<p>That’s where SeiDB comes in.</p>\n<p>Sei Labs has redesigned their database for high-performance storage, making sure that information is organized, stored, and accessed efficiently.</p>\n<p>Operationally, efficiency and performance is achieved by separating state store (SS) and state commit (SC). This bifurcation is designed to optimize Sei for two requirements: handling vast historical data and processing new transactions efficiently.</p>\n<p>SS pertains to historical data. By organizing data as raw key values while minimizing unnecessary metadata, SeiDB ensures that historical records–encompassing transactions, state changes, and other relevant data–are stored in a compact and accessible manner. This makes it easier to conduct auditing, transaction verification, and node synchronization. Such storage efficiency helps mitigate potential issues related to state bloat, ensuring that Sei remains scalable and efficient as it grows, not falling subject to diminishing performance from scale.</p>\n<p>SC deals with the processing and validating of new transactions by performing state changes in-memory and streamlining access to the most recent state information. This way, SeiDB reduces the need for intensive Input/Output operations, enabling faster transaction validation and commitment.</p>\n<p>The above architecture positions Sei in a place to aptly deal with high-volume applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>The heightened activity in the prior bull market exposed some limitations in blockchain technology as networks experienced high gas fees and slow transaction speeds. However, in the recent bear market, Sei emerged with technological innovations that hoped to address these limitations. Sei Labs created a Layer-1 network with the goal of becoming the fastest network for exchanging digital assets. Sei’s built-in blockchain technologies, such as Twin-Turbo Consensus and transaction parallelization, enable reduced transaction latency and increased transaction throughput.</p>\n<p>Sei v2’s efficient design is meant to introduce an influx of applications that have not been previously possible due to the limited EVM design space. SVM and MoveVM chains will act as the direct architectural competitors to Sei going forward since they’ve been able to introduce unique applications like onchain order books. More parallelized EVMs will invariably be introduced in the coming months as well. Solana also has a parallelized EVM L2 called Neon, which has so far gained very little traction. This puts Sei in a strong position because it, ideally, enables high-throughput applications while simultaneously bringing forward a familiar developer environment.</p>\n<p><strong>SEI V2 (EVM Compatible) is set to go live on mainnet before the end of this Q2. (Before the end of June). And Sei V2 Code is COMPLETE! We are closer than ever to the V2 update!</strong></p>\n<p>Dear Maker Community!

Latest dynamics suggest that highly bullish sentiment subsided in the light of an uncertain geopolitics and macro environment among other factors. The relative demand for long leverage decreased in the recent weeks, resulting in a drop in borrowing and funding rates in various onchain and cefi crypto markets.</p>\n<p>Maker position in terms of peg stability and stablecoin reserves improved substantially and is currently very strong. Given that Ethena exposure is unlikely to be increased in the short term period, and that crypto rates decreased noticeably, we believe it is time to start lowering the rates and increasing competitiveness and crypto exposure.</p>\n<p>We are continuing the work on updating the rate system language and corresponding interest rate model in the Stability Scope, where good progress has been made. The development on this front will be revealed and shared for feedback with the community in the coming weeks followed by a proposal to include it into the Stability Scope. Hopefully this new interest rate model and Stability Scope rate system will be able to replace and improve what currently exists, resulting in a very predictable methodology for rate setting going forward.

The main goal of this work is to provide useful data and input that can help safely navigate the Maker Protocol during the period in which SFs, the DSR, and the Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY are subject to out-of-scope decision making processes under article 3.3.</p>\n<p>For example, on March 20, we posted <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-8-accelerated-proposal/23909\">Impact Analysis: March 8 Accelerated Proposal</a>. Based on the findings of this analysis, <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-11-under-sta-article-3-3/23910\">we proposed</a> an overall decrease of SFs, the DSR, and the Spark Effective DAI Borrow Rate by 2 percentage points.</p>\n<p>Article 3.3 in the Stability Scope states that once market risks have subsided, the Dai Savings Rate and Base Rate should be reverted to their ordinary values. However, since March 8, wider market changes, as well as changes to internal Maker governance procedures and Scope related language, have resulted in previous Stability Scope parameters becoming relatively outdated. Before returning to a more normal Stability Scope procedure for determining rates, we believe that MakerDAO first needs to define and implement new ways to adapt to increased market volatility in order to minimize the risk of additional Out-of-Schedule Executive Votes.</p>\n<p>We are currently working on updating the rate system language in the Stability Scope, including a new iteration of the Exposure Model. Our objective is to make sure that the system as a whole will be able to adjust rates more gradually and effectively in the future. However, this will require some more research and development time.</p>\n<p>Until the new rate system language has been ratified by Maker governance, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> will continue to provide regular updates on Maker Protocol dynamics and provide parameter change proposals if we believe that any additional changes need to be made.</p>\n<p>With this post, we aim to review competitive rates in DeFi as well as the resulting protocol dynamics following the most recent parameter change proposal from March 20, 2024.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"impact-analysis-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#impact-analysis-2\"></a>Impact Analysis</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"exposure-over-time-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#exposure-over-time-3\"></a>Exposure Over Time</h2>\n<p>The chart below shows the change in DAI supply from March 20 (time of most recent parameter change proposal) to April 18 (time of writing).

On the other hand, both Maker Core Vaults and the Spark DAI Market have experienced negative flows, bringing crypto collateral exposure down to ~43.37%.</p>\n<p>As it relates to Ethena exposure benchmarks, in the current market environment, it seems as if the weighted average borrow rate of the Morpho Spark DAI Market will not exceed the “max borrow rate” of 38.07% in the near future. In fact, at the time of the analysis, the weighted average borrow rate is slightly below the “min borrow rate”, which should justify an exposure reduction if we do not see any changes soon. Note, however, that since this framework is relatively new, we expect to make iterative changes to the target rate benchmark formula over time, and as such, these requirements may change. Nevertheless, based on the broad heuristics of the new Allocation Benchmark, we can conclude that additional Morpho Spark DAI Vault allocations may not happen within the shorter term.</p>\n<p>To incentivise inflows to Maker Core Vaults and the Spark DAI market, an additional reduction in Stability Fees (SFs) and the Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY may at this point in time be justifiable. From a liquidity perspective, and considering that is unlikely that Ethena exposure will increase in the near future, lowering rates at this point in time seems more sustainable.</p>\n<p>Despite the most recent DSR rate reduction, we have seen DSR utilization increase over time. At the time of the analysis, DAI in the DSR measured ~1.68 billion, with a DSR utilization rate of 33.59%. If Maker governance decides to lower SFs and the Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY, it may therefore be prudent to also lower the DSR.</p>\n<p>Finally, comparing Maker rates with competitors in the DeFi Ecosystem, it is clear that Maker is currently more expensive, which can be seen as another relevant reason for an additional rate reduction.</p>\n<p>Based on the findings of this analysis, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> will soon propose parameter changes in accordance with article 3.3 in the Stability Scope. In a separate forum post, we will propose a decrease in the Stability Fees, Spark DAI Effective Borrow APY, and the DSR.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-20-parameter-change-proposal/24131\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-20-parameter-change-proposal/24131","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Apr 2024 12:16:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24131"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/impact-analysis-march-20-parameter-change-proposal/24131.rss","#text":"Impact Analysis: March 20 Parameter Change Proposal"},"filter":false},{"title":"Atlas Axis Update | Monday April 22 - 8 pm CET (6pm UTC)","dc:creator":"Le_Bateleur","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p><strong>Zoom link</strong>: <a href=\"https://zoom.us/j/93540012501?pwd=Y21rK0syZnF2RUJFaVZtMWVBaWdKQT09\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Launch Meeting - Zoom</a></p>\n<p>Hello everyone! <img src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/images/emoji/twitter/wave.png?v=12\" title=\":wave:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wave:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>It’s been a while since our last workshop!

The AVCs successfully proved it was possible to use small-scale incentives of MKR tokens to draw active community members into deep governance involvement. Now that the community has progressed closer to Launch Season, and there is increasingly a need for more practical and flexible execution of Endgame concepts, the AVCs are starting to be less effective in producing useful results that help move the project forward.</p>\n<p>I believe a major reason is that the concept was based on AVCs getting significant amounts of support and having functional AI governance tools available to them. In practice it has not been possible yet to provide this level of support.</p>\n<p>The most important results from AVCs have already been delivered. Ultimately, we can consider the initiative a success, and then use what we learned from it to create new replacement structures that synergize better with Launch Season.</p>\n<p>An evolution of the concept of should be reintroduced in the future when it is possible to provide the necessary level of support to fully realize the vision of comprehensive and knowledgeable community oversight by non-expert volunteer participants. More on this at the end of this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"atlas-community-committee-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#atlas-community-committee-2\"></a>Atlas Community Committee</h1>\n<p>The first replacement to the AVC is the Atlas Community Contributors, which will be based on the successful effort that is now being led by Atlas Axis and a small group of delegates to build out the Atlas v2. The Atlas Community Contributors will be a way for current AVC members, or new community contributors, to get compensated for delivering useful work that supports the work being done by the Atlas v2 effort on a part time basis.</p>\n<p>Depending on the availability of appropriate candidates, the Community workstream may be composed of different groups (ie, Drafters, Reviewers and Researchers), each with different levels of compensation commensurate with the required skill level.

This incorporates elements from our risk analysis posts, as well as additional mechanisms for rate targeting to ensure the vault achieves an adequate risk adjusted return.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"exposure-limits-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#exposure-limits-1\"></a>Exposure Limits</h3>\n<p>From our previous reports, we recommended to limit exposure to Ethena according to the following heuristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10% of perpetual futures open interest</li>\n<li>20% of DAI circulating supply</li>\n<li>30% of total USDe supply</li>\n<li>Maintaining tail risk exposure within acceptable limits</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that Ethena recently added Bitcoin as a collateral asset for delta neutral strategies, the constraint on total share of open interest has become less prominent. DAI supply is just below 5 billion, indicating a limit of roughly 1 billion DAI exposure to USDe. Similarly, with 200 million DAI current exposure and 2.3 billion USDe supply, the USDe supply constraint also yields a maximum limit of roughly 1 billion DAI exposure. This makes tail risk mitigation the primary constraint for Maker’s USDe exposure growth.</p>\n<p>The recently posted <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/susde-usde-exposure-increase-analysis/24074\">exposure increase analysis</a> provides data on the levels of bad debt incurred at various USDe haircuts, depending on how much additional capital is deployed to the vault. Generally speaking, bad debt is minimal unless USDe falls at least 10%, and with moderately higher haircuts of 20-30% bad debt remains manageable even as exposure grows significantly. Higher USDe loss rates begin to present a more serious problem with high exposure; for example Maker could incur roughly 200-250 million of bad debt with a 50% USDe haircut at 600 million DAI total exposure. For now, we believe the 600 million DAI maximum deployment remains appropriate to balance revenue growth vs resilience, with actual amounts deployed dependent on market conditions and continued improvements in Ethena fundamental risks.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"vault-return-benchmarks-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#vault-return-benchmarks-2\"></a>Vault Return Benchmarks</h3>\n<p>We can judge the risk/reward of supplying to the Morpho vault by comparing the weighted average borrow rate of the vault’s supplied assets to Maker’s marginal cost of capital (DSR). The spread between these values should be sufficiently large to justify the tail risk exposure of Ethena exposure.</p>\n<p>We consider borrow rates rather than the vault supply yield because only funds that are actively borrowed enter circulation and impact Maker’s cost of capital. Additionally, fluctuations in liquidity utilization ratio on Morpho can introduce unnecessary noise into risk/return calculations, and lead to a negative feedback loop where the vault continuously withdraws funds keeping utilization artificially elevated and preventing the pools from achieving rate equilibrium.</p>\n<p>The below chart shows our initial recommended rate benchmarking strategy for managing allocations to the Spark DAI vault. We derive a target borrow rate based on a spread vs the DSR, with the spread increasing as a function of exposure. The equation for calculating target borrow rate is implemented twice, with one version using fixed values for base and slope while the other uses proportional values referencing the DSR. This should ensure that the spread between DSR and target rates is sufficiently large even in low DSR environments, and scales up when the DSR is elevated. We expect to make iterative changes to the target rate benchmark formula over time: changing base and slope parameters, adding other input variables, and potentially changing the reference rate from DSR to value.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/7/977106c5affdce4348527e3abe41f93804ad69f0.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lBIfSrtfEIqbBpEfGpXNSfe1B9S.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/7/977106c5affdce4348527e3abe41f93804ad69f0_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"lBIfSrtfEIqbBpEfGpXNSfe1B9S\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/7/977106c5affdce4348527e3abe41f93804ad69f0_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/7/977106c5affdce4348527e3abe41f93804ad69f0_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/7/977106c5affdce4348527e3abe41f93804ad69f0.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pz7ugki9pD_ITHdRgF258VvXEGYg20gGG9m-5OVzKqI/edit?usp=sharing\">USDe Morpho Benchmarks</a></p>\n<p>Target borrow rate increases as exposure grows; this ensures that Maker gains increasing levels of risk compensation with higher Ethena exposure, which places a larger burden on Maker’s capital reserves. If exposure weighted average borrow rates consistently exceed the “max borrow rate” target for a multi-day period, this justifies increasing the amount of DAI deployed to the vault (within relevant maximum exposure limits). On the other hand, rates falling below the “min borrow rate” target would justify a reduction in exposure. Our current implementation of rate benchmarking targets a base of 120% higher than the DSR at 0 exposure, and roughly 1% borrow rate increase per 50 million DAI allocated.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pool-selection-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#pool-selection-3\"></a>Pool Selection</h3>\n<p>Borrowers’ willingness to pay for leverage, and by extension individual pools’ equilibrium borrow rates, should depend primarily on their expected all-in returns from the leveraged position.

The optimal rate is slowly adjusted when utilization is above or below the 90% target, so it effectively integrates average borrowing demand over time. The only exception where an asset has a higher optimal rate for a lower LLTV pool is the sUSDe 91.5% pool having higher rate than 94.5% pool. This may be driven by market inefficiency from the much smaller portion of funds deployed to the 94.5% LLTV pool.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/a/8a7657da9cc87743c15d95fd83cd14eb21e949dd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/jKTrhpPhGAhjTbleEkhteEfhhpz.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/a/8a7657da9cc87743c15d95fd83cd14eb21e949dd_2_624x137.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"jKTrhpPhGAhjTbleEkhteEfhhpz\" width=\"624\" height=\"137\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/8/a/8a7657da9cc87743c15d95fd83cd14eb21e949dd_2_624x137.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/a/8a7657da9cc87743c15d95fd83cd14eb21e949dd.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/8/a/8a7657da9cc87743c15d95fd83cd14eb21e949dd.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEEEEE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pz7ugki9pD_ITHdRgF258VvXEGYg20gGG9m-5OVzKqI/edit?usp=sharing\">USDe Morpho Benchmarks</a></p>\n<p>While higher LLTVs offer a higher yield as expected, we continue to believe that moderate LLTVs of 86% and 91.5% offer the best risk adjusted return, and offer better scalability due to having less tail risk exposure. 77% LLTV pools offer even greater safety against losses, but borrowers’ willingness to pay seems to drop off significantly at this level so the tradeoff of risk vs reward is a bit less favorable. This is demonstrated in the above data for optimal borrow rate divided by LLTV, with the 91.5% and 86% pools showing strong efficiency (sometimes even exceeding 94.5% LLTV pools) while the 77% pools drop off a bit. We recommend the majority of additional funds should be allocated into the moderate 86% and 91.5% LLTVs.</p>\n<p>Based on a review of borrow rates across pools, and assuming borrowers are targeting roughly 100-200% APY equivalent total return regardless of the pool LLTV or collateral asset (USDe vs sUSDe), we find that the market seems to be valuing sats at around 2-4% APY per sat per day (eg. 10 sats per day is equivalent to earning 20-40% APY). This means that sUSDe would need to earn between 30-60% in cash yield to deliver an equivalent total return to USDe in current conditions. This level of funding yield seems unlikely to be sustained over significant periods. For this reason, along with current user preferences for USDe collateral as demonstrated by higher borrowing rates, we recommend to focus new allocations solely into the USDe pools. However, we will reevaluate this relative split regularly, as users’ return expectations from the sats campaign may shift quickly depending on ENA token price and other factors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#next-steps-4\"></a>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>We expect to make improvements to the overall vault rate benchmarking methodology over time to account for additional relevant variables. Additionally, as we continue to gain more data on relative pool rates and performance, we will implement some intra-vault optimization heuristics to ensure the Spark DAI vault is achieving optimal risk/reward (eg. methods to judge when the vault should reallocate funds between pools). We also plan to define milestone based framework linking increases in exposure beyond certain total capital thresholds to improvements in Ethena transparency, resilience, and fundamental risk factors.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/usde-and-susde-allocation-benchmarks/24076\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/usde-and-susde-allocation-benchmarks/24076","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Apr 2024 13:29:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24076"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/usde-and-susde-allocation-benchmarks/24076.rss","#text":"USDe and sUSDe Allocation Benchmarks"},"filter":true},{"title":"RWA Foundation/HVB - Monthly Reporting (March 2024)","dc:creator":"InfoAgent","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>Please find the Monthly Summary Cash Report for the period ending March 31, 2024 below:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/c/3cc93d59ed375fd976f63c3e06bba285e1ae9152.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8FJNJDKIjwgA6jN8xG1TQEk97YS.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/c/3cc93d59ed375fd976f63c3e06bba285e1ae9152_2_390x800.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"8FJNJDKIjwgA6jN8xG1TQEk97YS\" width=\"390\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/c/3cc93d59ed375fd976f63c3e06bba285e1ae9152_2_390x800.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/c/3cc93d59ed375fd976f63c3e06bba285e1ae9152_2_585x1200.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/c/3cc93d59ed375fd976f63c3e06bba285e1ae9152_2_780x1600.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EFEFEF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The report is also available on Pinata in both PDF and Excel formats <a href=\"https://app.pinata.cloud/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.pinata.cloud/</a></p>\n<p>CIDs on Pinata are:<br>\nQmQh5reLMR6qNkW9VfJVJgiVbBcU5dNjh1sjoep5qauksb<br>\nQmXBJhzWBPgzqrP6KfHXoEiMDda9ydM6nf1GFLHfa7crCD</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-foundation-hvb-monthly-reporting-march-2024/24075\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-foundation-hvb-monthly-reporting-march-2024/24075","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Apr 2024 11:19:56 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24075"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-foundation-hvb-monthly-reporting-march-2024/24075.rss","#text":"RWA Foundation/HVB - Monthly Reporting (March 2024)"},"filter":false},{"title":"sUSDe & USDe Exposure Increase Analysis","dc:creator":"DeFlamiingo","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In March, article <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104#5-3-2-morpho-overcollateralized-susde-or-usde-ddm\">5.3.2: Morpho overcollateralized sUSDe or USDe DDM</a> was <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmbndmkr#poll-detail\">ratified for inclusion</a> in the Stability Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact.

In the analysis section below, we cover (i) an overview of markets in the Spark DAI Vault, (ii) an analysis of users, their position preferences, and position health, and (iii) a scenario analysis focusing on simulated liquidation curves for current state and potential new deposits.</p>\n<p>Finally, we provide some insight into our plans going forward, and what we aim to achieve in the coming weeks.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"analysis-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#analysis-overview-2\"></a>Analysis Overview</h1>\n<p>The data in the analysis section below is updated through 9 April, 2024. The total debt exposure at the time of the analysis measured ~185 million DAI. Also note that users with less than 1,000 DAI debt have been omitted from the reviewed data. These users make up a significantly smaller share of the sample size (10M USD worth of collateral deposited by borrowers borrowing less than 1,000 DAI) and were excluded for the sake of analysis simplicity.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"markets-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#markets-3\"></a>Markets</h1>\n<p>The Morpho Spark DAI Vault currently consists of eight markets, split into two collateral asset categories (USDe and sUSDe) across four different “liquidation loan-to-value” (LLTV) parameter values, respectively.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows the total borrowed USD per market as of April 9, 2024. DAI debt exposure from USDe markets was ~122M, while sUSDe debt exposure measured ~63M Dai. This discrepancy is mainly driven by Maker’s current strategy of allocating a greater share of DAI towards USDe pools. However, by reviewing pool utilization levels, the USDe pools seem to attract more borrowing, which further supports our previous <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/morpho-spark-dai-vault-update-1-april-2024/24006\">speculation</a> – that users’ are currently prioritizing Ethena points and ENA tokens, and therefore opting for USDe pools with higher incentives.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/6/46f2b86f20e11458b1bab27ae632bf6c3510c04d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/a7DrQieSBO09ayoQZKvuxFkCTlH.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/6/46f2b86f20e11458b1bab27ae632bf6c3510c04d_2_624x435.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"a7DrQieSBO09ayoQZKvuxFkCTlH\" width=\"624\" height=\"435\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/6/46f2b86f20e11458b1bab27ae632bf6c3510c04d_2_624x435.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/6/46f2b86f20e11458b1bab27ae632bf6c3510c04d.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/6/46f2b86f20e11458b1bab27ae632bf6c3510c04d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D3DAED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>When looking at how median health rates differ across markets, we can see that the sUSDe 0.77 is the one exhibiting the highest health rate across its positions (1.26), while the USDe 0.945 is the one with the lowest health rate (1.03). It is interesting to point out that while the LLTV might play a role in determining the health factors (e.g. both health rates for 0.77 LLTV markets are above 1.15) it is important to monitor the variability of users’ positions across markets. Specifically, the health rates for the 0.945 LLTV markets differ significantly, since the sUSDe market has a health rate of 1.12. While their overall weight is not significant (both around $10M) it is still necessary to closely monitor the active positions in the market. This is also true for the median buffer over health rate, with 0.77 LLTV markets being more-than-well protected versus bad debt. Again, the USDe 0.945 market has a median buffer over bad debt of ~8%, requiring additional monitoring. What is very important to point out is that the largest market (USDe 0.86) is well protected against bad debt (22% buffer) and with relatively safe positions (1.11 health rate).</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/a/cab15e78e354075e9147685d3e3481fc38fd4f72.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sV6sxTdv4MXUD4B9Cpnd1L4Pv5U.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/a/cab15e78e354075e9147685d3e3481fc38fd4f72_2_624x376.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"sV6sxTdv4MXUD4B9Cpnd1L4Pv5U\" width=\"624\" height=\"376\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/a/cab15e78e354075e9147685d3e3481fc38fd4f72_2_624x376.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/a/cab15e78e354075e9147685d3e3481fc38fd4f72_2_936x564.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/a/cab15e78e354075e9147685d3e3481fc38fd4f72.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F5F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"users-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#users-4\"></a>Users</h1>\n<p>USDe currently makes up a larger amount of total debt exposure.

In reality, the primary market (minting/redeeming directly with Ethena) is currently the deepest and most important source of liquidity. Nevertheless, this is an important indicator to assess the rate at which cumulative debt exposures approach liquidation threshold levels.

In reality, certain users would want to maximize their yield and abandon positions by withdrawing available collateral up to the LLTV threshold. This holds true whenever the haircut is larger than 1 - LLTV.</p>\n<p>This analysis with more likely user behavior shows that at 20% haircut the bad debt would be slightly higher ($96M) while at 30% haircut the bad debt would be equal to $200M for exposures of $1B.

For a $600M overall exposure, bad debt would be covered up to a ~25% haircut.</p>\n<p>However, this scenario is more likely for users in markets with higher LLTVs, but it is not a universal behavior for all users. Since MakerDAO would decrease its position in the market, interest rates would likely skyrocket.

This is likely driven by higher incentives directed towards USDe. However, it may still be too early to definitively judge, since perhaps more time and liquidity is needed before a stable equilibrium can be reached. Furthermore, the analysis may be biased as a result of Maker’s current allocation strategy, which supplies 65% of the total vault target debt to USDe pools. There are some signs pointing towards smaller users preferring sUSDe, but with higher leverage. Finally, this trend might change if Ethena decides to reallocate incentives. USDe markets have a total of 122 million in exposure, versus 63 million for sUSDe, with an almost equal amount of wallets across USDe and sUSDe collateral categories.</p>\n<p>There is a relatively low concentration of borrowers. Furthermore, positions are well collateralized, with a median health factor across all markets of 1.13, and debt weighted protection buffer before bad debt of ~22% across all positions.</p>\n<p>The scenario analysis highlights that Maker is currently able to sustainably cover bad debt up to 20% haircuts for any given exposure level up to $1B through the surplus buffer and protocol owned liquidity. The analysis of the vault’s behavior in case of additional deposits shows how different strategies can be pursued based on the risk tolerance to USDe haircuts.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"future-plans-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#future-plans-11\"></a>Future Plans</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"allocation-framework-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#allocation-framework-12\"></a>Allocation Framework</h2>\n<p>In our opinion, Maker governance should consider the risk related data (covered above) as well as the weighted average borrow rates of the Spark DAI Vault when deciding on what returns justify continued DAI allocation. <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> will only provide additional recommendations if the risk/return is favorable and the overall exposure is sustainable.

This additional safety feature was implemented as part of the SparkLend Proxy Spell (Ethereum) at <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x2f2c514137173bc98B3699A0d291f7593637c596\">0x2f2c514137173bc98B3699A0d291f7593637c596</a>, following an <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-sparklend-changes-compensation-distribution-halting-legacy-streams-offboarded-delegate-buffer-payments-and-update-hvbank-doc-january-12-2024\">executive vote</a> on January 12.</p>\n<p>The implementation details of an External Security Access Multisig (defined in section 10.3.1 in the Governance Scope), on the other hand, have not yet been defined or ratified by Maker Governance.</p>\n<p>Therefore, with this post, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> (i) introduces the practical details regarding the SparkLend External Security Access Multisig, and (ii) recommends to the Governance Facilitators to propose a governance poll regarding the SparkLend External Security Access Multisig is placed into the voting system in the next governance polling cycle.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"sparklend-external-security-access-multisig-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#sparklend-external-security-access-multisig-2\"></a>SparkLend External Security Access Multisig</h2>\n<p>According to section 10.3.1 in the Governance Scope, the Multisig Freeze feature of SparkLend should exist alongside the SparkLend Freezer Mom contract, ensuring that the Maker community can take timely action in case of an emergency which requires immediate intervention. The solution can only be used in cases of extreme emergencies such as potential code exploits which have existential threat potential.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-and-argumentation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#motivation-and-argumentation-3\"></a>Motivation and Argumentation</h2>\n<p>SparkLend is based on Aave v3 code base, which implies that technical exploits or malfunctions can be replicated between the protocols in some cases. SparkLend strategy has been much more risk-averse compared to Aave, since only blue-chip highly liquid asset are considered and non-essential features are disabled, which will likely continue to be the case, as Aave is adding additional features in the upcoming V3.1 while SparkLend is continuing to remove them in addition to development of new safety features. Nevertheless, since Aave governance has the ability to pause the markets in the form of <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/governance/master/aave-guardians\">Aave Guardians</a> while SparkLend is currently subject to governance spell process, the potential exploit time window is much longer in SparkLend. For this reason, we believe it is important to have an emergency access ability to react in a timely manner in the case there is a known exploit identified and prevent potential existential threat to the Maker Ecosystem and users of SparkLend.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"technical-ability-and-maker-governance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#technical-ability-and-maker-governance-4\"></a>Technical Ability and Maker Governance</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x44efFc473e81632B12486866AA1678edbb7BEeC3\">multisig</a> can enable or disable the GSM delay exception <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x237e3985dD7E373F2ec878EC1Ac48A228Cf2e7a3\">SparkLend Freezer Mom</a> without a governance spell while the Maker governance can reverse the action via a spell or entirely remove the multisig access in case there is a suspicion that it could or did act maliciously, which means that governance preserves full control.</p>\n<p>In the case of malicious use of the multisig access, the governance would therefore execute an emergency spell to reverse the action and remove the multisig access, and additionally make the decision of potentially reinstating the multisig and replacing the rogue or compromised signers.</p>\n<p>The multisig at launch would be 2/n, the n being 5 with intention of increasing the amount of signers later in time. Initial list of signers consists of two members from Governance Facilitators, BA Labs as a member of Stability Scope Advisory Council and finally one member from Phoenix Labs, the development team behind SparkLend.

This includes the activate/disable pause or freeze function. Any changes to the signers of the multisig, either addition or removal are subject to the governance poll. Only exception is, when a signer self-reports a loss of access to their private key due to any reason or explicitly expresses their wish to be removed in the form of a comment under this forum post or a separate forum post. In such instances Maker governance should replace this specific signer as soon as possible. Any other changes, which were not executed due to self-reporting by individuals or ratified by the governance should be questioned immediately and likely considered malicious, at which point governance should consider executing a spell to remove access from the multisig.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conditions-and-guidelines-for-activation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conditions-and-guidelines-for-activation-5\"></a>Conditions and Guidelines For Activation</h2>\n<p>Since this access is a great responsibility, it is vital that conditions for activation of the pause and/or freeze are predefined to the extent which is possible.

They claimed to have evidence of an operational security breach involving the Aligned Delegate <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/truename\">@truename</a>.</p>\n<p>Endgame Edge has implemented a protocol to protect the sensitive information of ADs. We requested that the informant and the AD establish a secure communication channel so that the evidence could be presented and discussed privately. After the evidence was sent to True Name, the AD asked us to review the evidence and apply our judgment to evaluate the situation.</p>\n<p>The evidence, sent to me, consisted of on-chain transactions that showed a multisig, set up by True Name, that contained a signer who was also a signer of the multisig of one AVC Member, ACRE DAOs.</p>\n<p>I involved <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/jansky\">@JanSky</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/ldr\">@ldr</a> to assist with the investigation, and we confirmed that the evidence was accurate. We verified that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The multisig was created by True Name’s EA address on 7/4/2023.</li>\n<li>The signers of the multisig were True Name’s EA address and one of the current signers of ACRE DAO’s multisig.</li>\n<li>On the same day, 10 MKR were received from Coinbase and delegated to True Name.</li>\n<li>On 8/16/2023, the MKR were undelegated and transferred to Coinbase.</li>\n<li>The address was removed as a signer of the multisig by True Name’s EA address on the same day the whistleblower sent the evidence to the AD.</li>\n<li>The signer shared by both multisig wallets was recently added to ACRE DAO’s multisig on 2/2/2024.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then asked True Name and ACRE DAOs to provide explanations. The explanations we received indicated that an external entity related to the AVC member, contacted the AD, offering to delegate MKR and asking True Name to set up a multisig where both could be signers. We verified that this multisig was indeed used to receive MKR and self-delegate it to True Name.</p>\n<p>MKR delegation can be done completely anonymously and permissionlessly. There was no need for True Name to set up a multisig and handle MKR from an MKR holder. True Name should have been more cautious, as this is at least an operational security error or a failure to follow best practices. Under <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-operational-security\">MIP101 Section 2.6.6</a>, this situation requires the facilitator to immediately derecognize the AD. We also believe that this behavior could be considered against <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-5-aligned-delegate-alignment-risk-mitigation\">MIP101 Section 2.6.5</a>.</p>\n<p>At the time True Name created the multisig to receive the MKR, the sections of the Atlas were different, but the spirit of the sections was similar. For instance:</p>\n<p><strong>Section 2.6.5:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ADs are generally not allowed to engage directly with Ecosystem Actors and other counterparts to the DAO, or engage in other operational activities. They must remain focused on their job of using their physical voting power over the protocol to safeguard its alignment. Additionally, they must publicly provide governance information and research material to AVCs and can interact with ecosystem participants for this purpose. They are also not allowed to provide ‘kickbacks’ from their compensation to MKR holders that delegate to them. Any violation of these requirements constitutes breaching the Alignment Conserver requirements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Section 2.6.6.1:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>FacilitatorDAOs must err on the side of caution and act in case there is any kind of real possibility that the privacy of an AD is compromised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Section 2.6.5.1:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a FacilitatorDAO finds that an AD has performed a misaligned act or breached their requirements, they can derecognize the AD and confiscate their AD Buffer. The AD Buffer can be used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor provided useful data, information, or evidence that led to the derecognition of the AD. GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of the whistleblower bounty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, as the purpose of these sections is to protect the protocol, we interpret that they must be applied <strong>retroactively in their current status</strong>. This is because if the operational security of the AD was compromised before the introduction of the rule, it creates the same harm as if it were compromised afterward, resulting in an AD with poor operational security.</p>\n<p>After carefully discussing the situation and considering the on-chain evidence and explanations from both parties, we (JanSky, Ldr, and VoteWizard) have unanimously decided that the situation warrants the derecognition of True Name.</p>\n<p>We have also decided to issue an <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-4-1\">official warning</a> to ACRE DAOs, as the address added as a signer to True Name’s multisig was also a signer of ACRE DAOs’ multisig. We have received and understood their explanation, which mentioned that this is a different legal person and not the same entity as ACRE DAOs. However, the address was connected to ACRE DAOs as it was the singer of its multisig, and we do not want to set a precedent in which an AVC member can collaborate with an AD to set up a multisig to handle MKR for them.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"whistleblower-bounty-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#whistleblower-bounty-1\"></a>Whistleblower Bounty</h2>\n<p>As per <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-operational-security\">MIP101 Section 2.6.6</a>, part of the AD’s buffer is designated as a whistleblower bounty to the informant, under specific conditions. We believe that these conditions have been satisfied, but we will provide confirmation in a subsequent post.</p>\n<br>\n<p>To conclude, Endgame Edge extends our deepest gratitude to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/truename\">@truename</a> for their invaluable contributions to MakerDAO</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ad-derecognition-due-to-operational-security-breach-april-5-2024/24043\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ad-derecognition-due-to-operational-security-breach-april-5-2024/24043","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 23:45:04 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24043"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ad-derecognition-due-to-operational-security-breach-april-5-2024/24043.rss","#text":"AD Derecognition due to Operational Security Breach - April 5, 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"BlockTower Credit - Monthly Report (03/01/24 - 03/31/24)","dc:creator":"BlockTower","category":"General Discussion","description":"<h3><a name=\"preamble-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#preamble-1\"></a>Preamble</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">Title: BlockTower Credit Monthly Arranger Report\nPeriod: 02/29/24 - 03/31/24\nPosted: 04/05/24\nAuthor: @BlockTower\nTags: @Recognized-Delegates @Aes @roo\nIlks: RWA012-A, RWA013-A\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a name=\"references-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#references-2\"></a>References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-collateral-onboarding-application-blocktower-credit-arranger/16900/1\">BlockTower Credit (Arranger) Collateral Onboarding Application</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocktower-credit-commercial-and-legal-risk-assessment-part-i/18790\">BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part I</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocktower-credit-commercial-and-legal-risk-assessment-part-ii/18791\">BlockTower Credit - Commercial and Legal Risk Assessment - Part II</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-blocktower-credit-transaction-documents/19019\">BlockTower Credit Legal Transaction Documents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"executive-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#executive-summary-3\"></a>Executive Summary</h3>\n<p>During this reporting period, we sourced and settled 3 new assets.

In this article, let’s look under the hood with a money-view lens.</p>\n<p>Ethena is more or less a tokenized cash-and-carry trade product where they hold a long spot crypto position (e.g. ETH) and short it on the future market. There are a few twists (we are in crypto after all), but it is similar to the <a href=\"https://www.financialresearch.gov/working-papers/files/OFRwp-21-01-hedge-funds-and-the-treasury-cash-futures-disconnect.pdf\">Treasury cash-futures basis trade</a> from TradFi. The crypto cash-future arbitrage isn’t new. It was nicknamed as the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-18/crypto-s-money-printing-machine-has-turned-back-on-for-now?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;sref=QrVPDIHG\">“the closest thing to a risk-free bet”</a> by Bloomberg in 2021, it’s back. I would suggest reading the excellent BIS paper <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1087.pdf\">Crypto-Carry</a> . As we are in the middle of a bull market the yield of such a strategy generally increases with upward volatility and has ranged from <a href=\"https://app.ethena.fi/dashboards/yields\">20-120% APY</a>. This is a significant yield for a “close to risk-free bet” which has attracted significant interest with Ethena growing from $100mm in deposits in early January 2024 to nearly $2B as of this writing (April 3rd, 2024).</p>\n<p>Given the attractive risk/reward, MakerDAO voted to take an indirect exposure to it through collateralized loans backed by sUSDe. What happened is depicted in the diagram below. Starting with assets like T-Bills earning around 5% (as always there are some simplifications), Maker decided to finance crypto-backed loans instead. As you can expect, there were some speculators that wanted more exposure to the 60% organic yield of sUSDe, and were more than happy to use leverage (which even at a funding cost is below the sUSDe yield). The operation didn’t change the balance sheet size of MakerDAO nor its liabilities. It was simply an asset swap. It doesn’t directly impact the DAI holders balance sheet. The US government loses some funding for the benefit of speculators, but I doubt it makes a difference.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptobanking.network/?attachment_id=537\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/4/446462e06f990b6d786a59e03a100e9456cfba6f.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9L1xL6n0t3CyNCVM9oYH2GRneIT\" width=\"690\" height=\"507\" role=\"presentation\"></a></p>\n<p>MakerDAO has been doing crypto-backed loans since its creation, it’s the bread and butter of the Maker Protocol. What is new is that Morpho was used instead of Maker vault or the newest Spark lending protocol. While Morpho is newer, it is considered by some more secure due to its small and immutable codebase.</p>\n<p>Like any highly leveraged loan, the issue is the price feed. Contrary to TradFi, crypto doesn’t wait to liquidate when the collateral is no longer sufficient. Nonetheless, fast liquidations can sometimes be more of a problem than a solution. If there is stress in the market and people start to dump sUSDe, it will quickly depeg from its underlying price (or net asset value), leading to more liquidation and a larger depeg. This could easily lead to liquidation at a price lower than the loaned amount even if there is just a short time of market dislocation. It relates to the very old question about mark-to-model vs mark-to-market.</p>\n<p>High leverage and fixed price is not unprecedented, Maker previously had a <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/collateral/GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A\">loan facility for DAI/USDC liquidity pool</a> which let people take a 50x leverage position. The USDC price was fixed at par with DAI. This means the market price didn’t have any influence on liquidations.</p>\n<p>With a fixed price oracle, liquidation only happens when the interest accrued puts the position as liquidable. It is a slow process. One has then a few days, maybe even weeks, to process the liquidation before incurring bad debt. That is at the fixed price. The actual real price might be another story. This is where it becomes asset transmutation.</p>\n<p>Let assume sUSDe loses 10% of value during a sustained period of negative funding rates. Lets also assume that the loan-to-value was just below 95%, and that a position gets liquidated at 95% and that there is no liquidation penalty (a bounty for people doing liquidation). The speculator is therefore wiped out and loses everything. The position can’t be liquidated because at this stage Morpho still considers that everything is fine due to the fixed price.</p>\n<p>What will happen is that interest will accrue, increasing the size of the crypto-backed loan (both on the liabilities of the speculator and on the asset side of MakerDAO). In the diagram below, the impairment red box represents the difference in sUSDe and for the crypto-backed loan due to the price discrepancy. Notice that as interest accrues, the equity of the speculator shrinks (even with the fixed price) and MakerDAO equity increases (all fictitious in reality). At some point, even with the wrong price, the speculator will be wiped out and liquidation will be possible. One must notice that the liquidation price will still be in a non-impaired position. Therefore, no one will have any economic incentive to liquidate the position. No one but MakerDAO. MakerDAO just has to mint some DAI to repay the crypto-backed loan that it owns (the minted DAI being burned at the end). This is an atomic transaction that will delete the crypto-backed loan and move the collateral (sUSDe) from the speculator to MakerDAO. Assuming sUSDe on the MakerDAO balance sheet is valued at mark-to-market, it will realize the losses on the MakerDAO equity position (and revert all fictitious interest accrued).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptobanking.network/?attachment_id=539\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/2/626fc8a8aa26dc6148150fd7f82038e1d7e27df9.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"e2OhQsHI2YztxRqWgswvyZdeGvf\" width=\"683\" height=\"800\" role=\"presentation\"></a></p>\n<p>As one can see, from a secured lender, MakerDAO is now directly invested in sUSDe. Depending on the loss on sUSDe and the equity buffer of MakerDAO at the time, DAI holders may or may not be impacted.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, what is better a crypto-backed loan or investing directly in sUSDe? It’s actually nuanced. Crypto-backed loans allow to trade a slice of the yield for a junior tranche that will take first losses. In case of some negative funding rates and/or small operational losses, it will protect MakerDAO completely. In case of a more significant loss, this protection will be less effective. One can also consider the evolution of MakerDAO liquidity. Is a crypto-backed loan more or less liquid than a direct position in sUSDe? It is difficult to determine. Crypto-backed loans in DeFi have (for most) no maturity and liquidity is achieved by increasing interest rate, at worst until liquidation. sUSDe liquidity seems to be seven days. Therefore, it is hard to say which one is truly more liquid.</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/money-view-of-the-makerdao-morpho-ethena-drama/24026\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/money-view-of-the-makerdao-morpho-ethena-drama/24026","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Apr 2024 18:36:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24026"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/money-view-of-the-makerdao-morpho-ethena-drama/24026.rss","#text":"Money view of the MakerDAO/Morpho/Ethena drama"},"filter":false},{"title":"Stability.makerendgame.com: Dashboard & Alerts","dc:creator":"ecosystem-team","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Ecosystem acting as the Stability Scope Facilitator has replaced <a href=\"http://psm.makerendgame.com\">psm.makerendgame.com</a> with <a href=\"http://stability.makerendgame.com\">stability.makerendgame.com</a>.
