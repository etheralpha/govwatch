We are inviting qualified entities to submit proposals that address the objectives outlined <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-tokenization-grand-prix-parameters-objectives/24825\">here</a> in preparation for the launch of the SparkDAO.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we are seeking proposals that provide the highest capital efficiency with exposure to three month or lower duration US T-Bills and high liquidity, with liquidity being measured by time to redemption to USDC and the amount of friction/slippage. A sound legal structure with bankruptcy remoteness, clear description of tax implications, and any strategic value the asset manager can add to the Spark &amp; Maker ecosystem will also be key considerations. An initial allocation of up to $1bn is contemplated, with the potential to scale to meet future demand.</p>\n<p>We are requesting that all proposals be submitted by 20 September, 2024 to ensure the initial legal, technical, and operational work required to onboard the assets managers can be completed in a timely manner. After all proposals are submitted, the Grand Prix committee will review the offerings and propose the selections to MKR governance, which will recommend which asset managers will be onboarded. MakerDAO reserves the right to accept or reject any and all proposals for any reason, or for no reason, at any point prior to MakerDAO entering into a written contract with the RFP applicant. This RFP does not constitute an offer by MakerDAO to enter into a contract. No contract or other legally enforceable rights shall exist with respect to the subject of this RFP unless and until a writing is executed by MakerDAO.</p>\n<p>All responses, inquiries, or correspondence submitted in reference to this RFP, as well as any other documentation provided by an RFP applicant, will be the property of MakerDAO and will not be returned to the RFP applicant. MakerDAO reserves the right to request clarification of, or corrections to, RFP responses, and to reject any and all RFP responses, or to cancel the RFP in its entirety at MakerDAO’s sole discretion.</p>\n<p>All persons or firms who respond in any manner to this RFP (including having any contact with MakerDAO), irrespective of whether they submit a proposal, shall be deemed to have agreed to the foregoing terms.</p>\n<p><strong>Please submit the following:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The completed “Grand Prix Application” on the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/c/spark-subdao/spark-tokenization-grand-prix/102\">forum</a> with the tag [Spark Tokenization Grand Prix] with the title in the form of “Tokenization Grand Prix Application - [Applicant Name]”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additional fee concessions, incentives, or other terms to the email address, <a href=\"mailto:GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial\">GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial</a>, which will be kept confidential until the winners are selected.

The final section focuses on MakerDAO’s SubDAO, Spark’s new initiative, The Spark Tokenization Grand Prix. The article is designed to inform and support the community and interested parties in understanding and engaging with this exciting development.</p>\n<p>RWAs refer to physical or traditional financial assets that are brought onto the blockchain through a process called tokenization. This process converts assets into digital tokens that can be represented on-chain. While tokenization offers several advantages, it also presents some challenges. Some of the advantages include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased Liquidity</strong>: Liquidity refers to the efficiency with which an asset can be converted into another form, such as fiat currency or a stablecoin, without a significant loss in value.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, ensuring visibility for all.</li>\n<li><strong>Trustless System</strong>: Smart contracts automate and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Transaction Costs</strong>: Trading on a blockchain can significantly lower costs compared to traditional methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Fractional Ownership:</strong> High-value assets can be divided into smaller portions, making them more accessible to a broader range of investors. This approach has been effectively applied in tokenized real estate, allowing the general public to participate in such investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, the challenges of tokenizing RWAs can also be significant. Sébastien Derivaux, co-founder of Steakhouse Financial, discusses in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEAo2tjEOV8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">podcast</a> the early RWA work at MakerDAO and the challenges associated with investing in RWAs from a decentralized protocol. Some of the challenges highlighted in the podcast are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Requirements</strong>: Compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations is complex.</li>\n<li><strong>Communicating Complex Financial Concepts</strong>: It’s challenging to ensure that non-experts can make informed decisions in a decentralized environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Institutional Adoption</strong>: Integrating RWAs into institutional frameworks faces hurdles due to regulatory uncertainties and infrastructure limitations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"types-of-rwas-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#types-of-rwas-2\"></a>Types of RWAs</h3>\n<p>There are many use cases for RWAs, with stablecoins being one of them. As the market for RWAs continues to grow, we can expect an even broader range of tokenized assets in the future. The following are just a few examples of what kinds of assets can be tokenized on the blockchain, with a lot more expected to emerge in the future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real Estate</strong>: This includes residential, commercial, and industrial properties. Real estate tokenization allows investors to own fractional shares of properties, providing liquidity and diversification.</li>\n<li><strong>Commodities</strong>: Physical commodities such as precious metals (gold, silver), agricultural products (grains, coffee), energy resources (oil, natural gas), and others can be tokenized to facilitate trading and investment.</li>\n<li><strong>Art and Collectibles</strong>: Tokenization of art, rare collectibles, and memorabilia enables fractional ownership and investment opportunities in traditionally illiquid markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Intellectual Property (IP)</strong>: This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other forms of intellectual property rights. Tokenization allows creators to monetize their IP assets and investors to participate in revenue-sharing agreements.</li>\n<li><strong>Equity and Securities</strong>: Shares of private companies, stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments can be tokenized to increase liquidity, streamline transactions, and enable global access to capital markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Revenue-Generating Contracts</strong>: Contracts with predictable revenue streams, such as leases, royalties, and licensing agreements, can be tokenized to provide investors with recurring income opportunities.</li>\n<li><strong>Deeds and Titles</strong>: Tokenization of deeds, titles, and ownership certificates for real estate, vehicles, and other assets can streamline transfer processes and enhance transparency in ownership records.</li>\n<li><strong>Carbon Credits and Renewable Energy Assets</strong>: Environmental assets such as carbon credits, renewable energy certificates (RECs), and carbon offsets can be tokenized to facilitate trading and investment in sustainable initiatives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/Quillhash/Real-World-Assets?tab=readme-ov-file#types-of-rwas-\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Quillhash</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"underlying-asset-us-treasury-bonds-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#underlying-asset-us-treasury-bonds-3\"></a><strong>Underlying asset: U.S. Treasury Bonds</strong></h3>\n<p>RWAs can derive value from yield-bearing assets and can help stabilize protocols through risk diversification. One of the most prominent examples of RWA tokenization in the crypto space is the tokenization of U.S. Treasury Bonds, also known as T-Bills. These government-issued instruments are used to borrow money from individuals, organizations, and institutions to fund various projects, offering lenders a yield in return.

The Grand Prix, which begins today (August 12, 2024), focuses on two key aspects: liquidity and capital efficiency, with an asset focus on short-duration US T-Bills and similar tokenized products.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"liquidity-vs-capital-efficiency-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#liquidity-vs-capital-efficiency-5\"></a><strong>Liquidity vs. Capital Efficiency</strong></h3>\n<p>Spark and MakerDAO are seeking projects that either maximize liquidity for frequent rebalancing or enhance capital efficiency with higher yields and less frequent rebalancing. Although these goals might seem at odds, successful projects will find a balance, ensuring that liquidity-focused products still offer attractive yields and yield-focused products maintain sufficient liquidity. The focus on T-bills and similar tokens highlights the need for assets that can deliver consistent returns while being easily tradable.</p>\n<p>In addition to these two focus areas, other criteria are essential to being competitive in the pool of RWAs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Legal Structure</strong>: Projects should present a solid legal framework that ensures bankruptcy remoteness, compliance with domestic and international regulations, and clarity regarding the jurisdiction and relevant regulatory authorities.</li>\n<li><strong>Cost Structure</strong>: Applicants must detail their fee structures, including management and transaction fees, any potential discounts, guarantees on the fee structure duration, and additional incentives.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: A crucial factor is how quickly and smoothly products can be redeemed for fiat-backed stablecoins.</li>\n<li><strong>Taxation</strong>: Projects need to explain the potential tax implications, ensuring transparency and compliance.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic Considerations</strong>: The competition also evaluates the broader strategic value a project brings to Spark and MakerDAO. This includes how the project aligns with and supports the growth and diversification goals of these platforms, as well as its potential for offering or developing products suitable for Spark or future SubDAOs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"liquidity-in-rwa-tokenization-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#liquidity-in-rwa-tokenization-6\"></a><strong>Liquidity in RWA Tokenization</strong></h3>\n<p>Liquidity is a fundamental concept in financial markets, referring to how easily an asset can be converted into cash or another form of value, such as stablecoins, without a significant loss in value. In the context of RWAs on the blockchain, liquidity is especially crucial. The ability to trade these tokenized assets efficiently and at scale directly impacts their attractiveness and viability within DeFi protocols.</p>\n<p>The focus on tokenizing assets like T-bills in the Spark Tokenization Grand Prix underscores the importance of liquidity. Liquidity enables the rapid rebalancing of portfolios, provides immediate access to funds, and helps stabilize the system during periods of volatility. Without sufficient liquidity, RWAs could become a bottleneck, limiting the protocol’s ability to respond to market conditions and potentially leading to inefficiencies or losses.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-in-liquidity-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#challenges-in-liquidity-7\"></a><strong>Challenges in Liquidity</strong></h3>\n<p>Tokenizing RWAs presents unique liquidity challenges. Unlike purely digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, RWAs are linked to physical or traditional financial assets, which inherently have lower trading volumes and are often subject to complex regulatory requirements. These factors can make it difficult to create a liquid market for RWAs, as the transfer of ownership may involve both on-chain and off-chain processes, increasing friction.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the integration of RWAs into DeFi platforms often leads to a fragmentation of liquidity across different blockchain networks. This fragmentation occurs because various institutional investors might prefer different blockchain platforms based on their specific needs for security, compliance, and transaction efficiency. As a result, assets can become confined to specific networks, creating “liquidity islands” where assets are not easily transferable or utilized across different platforms.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"solutions-in-liquidity-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#solutions-in-liquidity-8\"></a><strong>Solutions in Liquidity</strong></h3>\n<p>To address these liquidity challenges, several strategies can be followed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocols:</strong> Developing robust cross-chain interoperability solutions is essential for enabling the seamless transfer of assets between different blockchain networks. Protocols that facilitate interaction between isolated blockchain ecosystems can help reduce liquidity fragmentation and allow for greater integration and liquidity flow across diverse platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>Standardization of Token Protocols:</strong> Implementing standardized token protocols across different blockchain networks ensures compatibility and interoperability, which enhances liquidity. Existing standards, such as ERC-20 and ERC-721 on Ethereum, provide a foundation that can be extended to other blockchains, promoting harmonized tokenization practices and improving cross-chain operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and Aggregators:</strong> Decentralized exchanges that support multi-chain trading can aggregate liquidity from various blockchain networks, creating a unified marketplace for tokenized RWAs. This approach can help eliminate liquidity islands by enabling the free trade of assets across different chains.</li>\n<li><strong>Regulatory Clarity and Compliance Automation:</strong> Establishing clear regulatory frameworks and embedding automated compliance features within smart contracts are crucial for reducing legal barriers to tokenization and cross-chain asset transfer. Regulatory clarity will encourage more institutional participation, while compliance automation will streamline operations within the DeFi ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity Pools and Incentives:</strong> Creating dedicated liquidity pools for tokenized RWAs and offering incentives for liquidity providers can enhance overall market liquidity. By rewarding liquidity providers, platforms can attract more participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of tokenized RWAs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Spark Tokenization Grand Prix places a strong emphasis on liquidity in its evaluation criteria. Projects that can develop products offering quick and smooth redemption processes for fiat-backed stablecoins, while addressing the aforementioned challenges, are likely to excel in the competition.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"capital-efficiency-in-rwa-tokenization-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#capital-efficiency-in-rwa-tokenization-9\"></a>Capital Efficiency in RWA Tokenization</h3>\n<p>Capital efficiency refers to how effectively an investment can use its capital to generate returns. With the Spark Tokenization Grand Prix looking to invest $1 billion in tokenized T-bills, the focus is not just on whether to invest in T-bills, but rather on which tokenized T-bills to choose and how these choices can overcome capital efficiency challenges. Given that the Grand Prix emphasizes capital efficiency as a key criterion for successful projects, selecting the right tokenized T-bills becomes crucial.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"yield-in-capital-efficiency-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#yield-in-capital-efficiency-10\"></a><strong>Yield in Capital Efficiency</strong></h3>\n<p>For tokenized T-bills, capital efficiency is directly tied to the yield of the underlying T-bill. The yield of the underlying asset depends on several key factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interest Rates</strong>: When interest rates rise, the yield on the underlying T-bill generally increases, enhancing the profitability of the tokenized T-bill. Conversely, when interest rates fall, the yield decreases, potentially reducing returns.</li>\n<li><strong>Supply and Demand Dynamics</strong>: High demand for T-bills, especially during economic uncertainty, can drive yields down, while increased supply from government issuance can push yields up, affecting the capital efficiency of the tokenized version.</li>\n<li><strong>Inflation Expectations</strong>: Higher inflation expectations can lead investors to demand higher yields on T-bills to compensate for the reduced purchasing power, thereby influencing the returns on tokenized T-bills.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Conditions</strong>: Strong economic growth and favorable global economic factors can lead to higher yields, whereas economic slowdowns typically result in lower yields, impacting the efficiency of the capital deployed in tokenized T-bills.</li>\n<li><strong>Monetary Policy Expectations</strong>: Market expectations regarding future Federal Reserve actions can influence the yield on T-bills as investors adjust their strategies, which in turn affects the capital efficiency of the tokenized asset.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While distributors of tokenized RWAs can’t change these factors, there are other factors that can be optimized to make RWA investments more capital-efficient.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cost-management-in-capital-efficiency-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#cost-management-in-capital-efficiency-11\"></a><strong>Cost Management in Capital Efficiency</strong></h3>\n<p>The efficiency of capital deployment in RWAs is also significantly influenced by the costs associated with the investment. These costs include management fees, transaction fees, and other operational expenses incurred throughout the investment process. High fees can erode returns, making the investment less capital-efficient. Therefore, selecting RWA products with competitive fee structures is essential to maximizing net returns. For example, lower management fees can directly increase the overall yield of the tokenized T-bill, while minimizing transaction costs can reduce the friction of buying, selling, or managing these assets.</p>\n<p>The Spark Tokenization Grand Prix places a strong emphasis on capital efficiency as a key criterion for evaluating projects. Projects that can demonstrate the ability to maximize returns while maintaining sufficient liquidity and minimizing risk are likely to be highly competitive. By focusing on capital efficiency, the Grand Prix encourages innovation in the management of RWAs, driving the development of products that are profitable and aligned with MakerDAO’s vision.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"vision-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#vision-12\"></a><strong>Vision</strong></h2>\n<p>In Japanese, the name Akira signifies brightness, clarity, and truth, principles that guide my approach to exploring the complexities of crypto, blockchain, and RWAs.

This will result in custody being split across multiple jurisdictions including Hong Kong and Singapore, compared with current US based custody. Bitgo has disclosed that this change implements a partnership with Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem; as such we can infer that Justin Sun will have significant influence or control over the joint venture managing WBTC. This change in control is expected to take place in 60 days.</p>\n<p>This bears some similarity to the previous situation concerning control of the TUSD stablecoin, which was discussed in the Maker forum <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/tusd-is-undergoing-a-material-change-to-its-ownership-structure-is-there-a-process-for-reducing-exposure-in-the-event-of-a-material-change/5691\">here</a>. Since TUSD was placed into Justin Sun’s control, it has seen market deterioration in operational processes and transparency, including the resignation of the previous management team, suspension of real time proof of reserves, and several significant depegs caused by interruptions in redemption service. We have also seen other Sun affiliated projects show worrying signs of possible misappropriation, such as the substitution of Huobi’s USDT reserves with stUSDT, a Sun controlled RWA project that purports to hold a reserve of US treasury bills but has not provided clear audits or evidence that the backing exists. On the whole, we find that Sun’s involvement as a controlling interest in the new WBTC joint venture presents an unacceptable level of risk.</p>\n<p>We also note that Bitgo itself seems to have had some negative developments recently, including a failed acquisition by Galaxy Digital where Galaxy backed out for undisclosed reasons. This, along with the unexpected decision to divest from the WBTC product, may be indications of financial distress within Bitgo, and reflects negatively on Bitgo’s counterparty risk. While some of the risk factors are somewhat speculative, it makes sense to err on the side of caution given the critical role WBTC collateral plays within defi.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"recommended-actions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#recommended-actions-2\"></a>Recommended Actions</h3>\n<p>Given the upcoming change in control, BA Labs believes WBTC collateral integrations on Maker and SparkLend present an elevated level of risk.

The <code>fill()</code> function doesn’t seem to be the problem. There is still 3M Dai in the litePSM, so the decision is to wait for more devs from Dewiz to confirm the findings and suggest a path forward.</li>\n<li>2024-08-05 8:16AM UTC: 2 Dewiz devs confirm the issue is in the <code>CRON_LITE_PSM_JOB</code>. The issue is not an accounting issue, but a configuration issue in the job, as explained further below. Dewiz confirms <code>litepsm.fill()</code> can be called permissionlessly to fix the issue, as it would mint Dai to MAX DC. The date for deploying a fix is discussed, but no decision is taken at that moment.</li>\n<li>2024-08-05 8:28AM UTC: <code>litepsm.fill()</code> is called by an EA and the issue is solved for now.</li>\n<li>2024-08-05 1:56PM UTC: a logic to define correctly the parameters for the <code>CRON_LITE_PSM_JOB</code> is defined, documented and agreed upon. Redeploying the job with the new parameters will fix the issue fully. It is decided that no code changes in the job are needed and redeploying is not needed before the LitePSM Migration Phase 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"root-cause-analysis-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#root-cause-analysis-3\"></a>Root cause analysis</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>line</code> (max DC): Set to 50M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>gap</code>: Set to 20M</li>\n<li><code>buf</code>: Set to 20M</li>\n<li><code>fill</code>: Set threshold at 15M DAI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The initial migration of 20M + <code>buf</code> set to 20M made the normalized debt (<code>art</code>) for LITE-PSM-USDC-A be 40M. Since DC-IAM <code>line</code> is set to 50M, the value of the target pre-minted amount (<code>rush()</code>) would be <code>50M - 40M = 10M</code>. However, <code>fill</code> threshold is set to <code>15M</code> and therefore the keeper network job would never be executed.</p>\n<p>While the values were defined by BA Labs, Dewiz takes full responsibility for this mishap, because we failed to make ourselves clear regarding how the keeper network job configuration parameters would affect the execution.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#solution-4\"></a>Solution</h2>\n<p>For the reason outlined above, <code>fill()</code> had to be called manually by an EA collaborator, so LITE-PSM-USDC-A could reach the desired target debt of 50M.</p>\n<p>To make it clear, the keeper network job has 3 threshold parameters:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>rushThreshold</code>: the minimum Dai liquidity that is needed (<code>rush()</code>) in order for the job to call <code>fill()</code>.</li>\n<li><code>gushThreshold</code>: the minimum Dai excess liquidity (<code>gush()</code>) in order for the job to call <code>trim()</code>.</li>\n<li><code>cutThreshold</code>: the minimum Dai accumulated as swap fees (<code>cut()</code>) in order for the job to call <code>chug()</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given that DC-IAM is activated for LITE-PSM-USDC-A, moving forward, Dewiz suggests that the values of <code>buf</code> and DC-IAM <code>gap</code> and <code>rushThreshold</code> for the keeper network job such that:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">(gap % rushThreshold) == 0 &amp;&amp; rushThreshold &lt;&lt; gap &lt;= buf\n</code></pre>\n<p>In other words, the value for <code>rushThreshold</code> should be a divisor of and also significantly smaller (i.e. 10x) than <code>gap</code>, which should be less than or equal to <code>buf</code>.</p>\n<p>Also notice that when <code>gap &lt; buf</code>, the following rule must be enforced:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">(buf - gap) % rushThreshold == 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Otherwise the last possible <code>fill()</code> would not be triggered by the job, since <code>rushThreshold</code> would not be met.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"final-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#final-considerations-5\"></a>Final considerations</h2>\n<p>The design of the keeper network job is supposed to prevent calls to the bookkeeping functions of LITE-PSM-USDC-A to be called too frequently, which could cost a lot in terms of gas to the Maker Protocol. Having minimum thresholds for the respective calls to be made means that there could be up to <code>threshold - 1</code> of needed/excess liquidity or non-ingested swap fees at a given time.</p>\n<p>We discussed some possibilities to refactor the job, so the same issue does not happen again:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Change the behaviour of the job if it is too close to the active debt ceiling or to zero, making it ignore the thresholds: this could bring back the keeper network spamming problem when these conditions are met.</li>\n<li>Add a fallback time interval in which the job would be called if required, regardless of the threshold: this would be a significant refactor, increasing the complexity and potentially the gas costs of executing the job.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For now, being mindful of the values set for the parameters seems to be the best way forward. If we have other instances of LitePSM in the future, the keeper network job will have to be reworked to deal with multiple contracts, and we might then consider adding option 2. above.</p>\n<p>We also encourage integrators to bundle the swap with a <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@h3li0s/S1ZnJzFSC#Refill-Dai-Buffer\"><code>fill</code> call</a> if the Dai liquidity available at any given moment is not enough. While this increases the gas costs of the transaction, it will mostly be applicable only to very large swaps.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-job-post-mortem/24841\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-job-post-mortem/24841","pubDate":"Fri, 09 Aug 2024 15:42:23 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24841"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-job-post-mortem/24841.rss","#text":"LitePSM Job Post-Mortem"},"filter":false},{"title":"LITE-PSM-USDC-A Phase 2 (Major Migration): Proposed Parameters","dc:creator":"rema","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h1><a name=\"lite-psm-usdc-a-phase-2-major-migration-proposed-parameters-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#lite-psm-usdc-a-phase-2-major-migration-proposed-parameters-1\"></a>LITE-PSM-USDC-A Phase 2 (Major Migration): Proposed Parameters</h1>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The data and information presented here is provided for informational purposes only, on an “as is” basis, and without warranty of any kind.

With this design, Maker is able to enjoy USDC rewards while funds are self-custodied on-chain without reliance on TradFi banks and RWA trustees, as is the case in the current Coinbase Custody (RWA014-A) setup.</p>\n<p>Since the LitePSM can serve the same function as Coinbase Custody (RWA014-A), in Phase 2, we propose that Monetalis starts migrating USDC from RWA014-A to LITE-PSM-USDC-A based on throughput limits. The Coinbase Custody migration complies with the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/clydesdale-vault-hq/17923/88\">Clydesdale Wind-down process</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"migrate-all-but-200m-usdc-reserves-from-psm-usdc-a-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#migrate-all-but-200m-usdc-reserves-from-psm-usdc-a-7\"></a>Migrate All But 200M USDC Reserves from PSM-USDC-A</h2>\n<p>For Phase 2, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> believes that the LitePSM is ready to absorb the majority of existing stablecoin reserves. However, we recommend keeping 200M USDC reserves in PSM-USDC-A to continue supporting integrations that have not yet migrated to the LitePSM. These PSM-USDC-A reserves will be fully migrated to LITE-PSM-USDC-A in Phase 3, before PSM-USDC-A is offboarded.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"psm-usdc-a-tin-tout-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#psm-usdc-a-tin-tout-8\"></a>PSM-USDC-A tin &amp; tout</h2>\n<p>The main goal of Phase 2 is to absorb the majority of existing stablecoin reserves. The PSM-USDC-A will continue to be maintained only to support integrations that have not yet migrated. To incentivize migrations to the new LitePSM, we propose to introduce tin &amp; tout fees of 0.01%.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"dc-iam-parameters-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dc-iam-parameters-9\"></a>DC-IAM Parameters</h2>\n<p>In order to migrate most of the reserves from PSM-USDC-A to LITE-PSM-USDC-A, we recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decreasing the PSM-USDC-A line from 10B to 2.5B while increasing the line of LITE-PSM-USDC-A by a proportional amount, from 50M to 7.5B.</li>\n<li>Decrease the PSM-USDC-A gap from 380M to 200M, while increasing the gap of LITE-PSM-USDC-A from 20M to 200M.</li>\n<li>Increase the LITE-PSM-USDC-A buf from 20M to 200M.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes aim to migrate the majority of USDC reserves to LITE-PSM-USDC-A while maintaining total PSM exposures at levels similar to those before the LitePSM implementation.

We proposed reducing the delay to 16 hours to be able to assess new parameter changes and react promptly, if needed. Shortly thereafter, we proposed to increase the GSM Pause Delay to 30 hours. This duration aimed to minimize the risk of hostile governance attacks via malicious spells, while still enabling fasted execution compared to the previous 48-hour delay.</p>\n<p><strong>GSM Changes during the LitePSM Migration Plan:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> For the initial phase of the LitePSM migration, we proposed lowering the GSM Pause Delay to 16 hours. This adjustment aimed to provide a good compromise solution between being able to react quickly, while still being able to mitigate any potential malicious spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> As we move to Phase 2 of the LitePSM migration, we believe it is prudent to revert to the 30-hour GSM Pause Delay. This fasted execution delay compared to the original 48-hour delay is reasonable given the importance of PSM modules for the stability of Dai. The LitePSM has undergone sufficient testing, while not many integrations yet integrated with LitePSM, and the parameter changes from the March 8 Accelerated Proposal are now stable.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-scope-language-changes-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposed-scope-language-changes-11\"></a>Proposed Scope Language Changes</h1>\n<p>Assuming that the recommended parameters are approved by Maker Governance, the following values should be updated as illustrated below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"governance-scope-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#governance-scope-12\"></a>Governance Scope</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"governance-scope-1011a-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#governance-scope-1011a-13\"></a>Governance Scope - 10.1.1A</h3>\n<p>¤¤¤</p>\n<p>The GSM Pause Delay is: 30 hours</p>\n<p>¤¤¤</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lite-psm-usdc-a-phase-2-major-migration-proposed-parameters/24839\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lite-psm-usdc-a-phase-2-major-migration-proposed-parameters/24839","pubDate":"Fri, 09 Aug 2024 12:41:33 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24839"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lite-psm-usdc-a-phase-2-major-migration-proposed-parameters/24839.rss","#text":"LITE-PSM-USDC-A Phase 2 (Major Migration): Proposed Parameters"},"filter":false},{"title":"[Temperature check] DAI Teleport Integration Proposal","dc:creator":"Viktor_Symbiosis","category":"Ecosystem Proposals","description":"<h3><a name=\"abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h3>\n<p>As Maker Teleport has not been completed yet and there is no teleport solution for DAI at this moment, Symbiosis.Finance can provide a teleport for DAI across supported networks.

We aim to significantly enhance the value proposition for DAI liquidity providers on Uniswap V4 by using our advanced rehypothecation features to allow DAI LPs to rehypothecate idle funds (outside the current tick) to the DSR. We will also support rehypothecation to SparkLend itself. <a href=\"https://x.com/bunni_xyz/status/1821198979771826506\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Announcement</a></p>\n<p>About Bunni v2</p>\n<p>Bunni v2 builds on the solid foundation of Uniswap v4 by offering several unique features that set it apart in the DeFi space:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shapeshifting Liquidity: Provide liquidity in any shape, allowing for tailored liquidity distributions that optimize fee income and minimize impermanent loss.</li>\n<li>Dynamic Liquidity Shifting: Automatically adjust liquidity positions using TWAP or Chainlink oracles based on market conditions.</li>\n<li>ERC-20 Wrapped LP Tokens: Simplify liquidity management by converting non-fungible Uniswap V3 positions into fungible ERC-20 tokens, which can be easily used as collateral.</li>\n<li>Rehypothecation: Allows idle assets in liquidity positions to be deployed into yield-generating protocols like the DSR, Aave, or Gearbox, maximizing earning potential for liquidity providers.</li>\n<li>am-AMM: Optimizes performance by auctioning the right to set swap fees, minimizing losses from informed trades and maximizing revenue, with proceeds benefiting liquidity providers and pool managers essentially trading for free opening the door for arbitrage opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rehypothecation: A Catalyst for DAI Liquidity</p>\n<p>Our rehypothecation feature is particularly relevant for DAI liquidity providers. Here’s how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Idle Asset Utilization: Idle assets in liquidity positions can be deployed into yield-generating protocols like the DSR, Aave, and Gearbox to maximize liquidity providers’ earning potential.</li>\n<li>Enhanced Yields: DAI liquidity providers can significantly boost their returns by earning additional yield from these external protocols.</li>\n<li>Increased TVL and Protocol Profits: Deploying idle assets into yield-generating activities benefits liquidity providers and increases the total value locked (TVL) and profitability of the protocols involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Collaboration Opportunity</p>\n<p>We understand that AllocatorDAOs must actively engage in market-making against DAI, with at least 10% of their total portfolio. See <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp8-mip-amendment-subproposals/20761/7#h-7212-cash-stablecoin-market-making-requirements-81\">7.2.1.2: Cash Stablecoin Market Making Requirements.</a> Utilizing some of the POL to do this on Bunni v2 seems reasonable, considering our advantages in LP returns. We also have additional features specifically designed for market makers, such as our open-source am-AMM implementation, <a href=\"https://x.com/boredGenius/status/1773029505831174632\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bid Dog</a>. This would benefit AllocatorDAO market-making because, as the pool manager, they can trade without fees.</p>\n<p>Benefits for AllocatorDAOs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Returns: By earning additional yield from the DSR on idle DAI, AllocatorDAOs can significantly boost their overall returns on their holdings.</li>\n<li>Increased Capital Efficiency: The rehypothecation feature ensures that assets not currently used for trading are actively generating yield, improving the capital efficiency of the AllocatorDAOs’ portfolio.</li>\n<li>Automated Management: The process is fully automated, reducing the need for manual management and allowing AllocatorDAOs to benefit from additional yields without extra effort.</li>\n<li>Risk Mitigation: Utilizing the DSR for rehypothecation ensures that idle assets are deployed into a secure and stable yield-generating environment, mitigating risks associated with more volatile yield opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next Steps</p>\n<p>We invite you to try our testnet, which recently went live at Bunni.xyz. There, you can get a hands-on feel for how this would work. We are excited about the potential for this integration and look forward to further discussions on how we can bring these ideas to life. We hope to go live on mainnet the same day as Uniswap v4.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/enhancing-dai-liquidity-provision-with-bunnis-rehypothecation-features/24823\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/enhancing-dai-liquidity-provision-with-bunnis-rehypothecation-features/24823","pubDate":"Wed, 07 Aug 2024 16:45:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24823"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/enhancing-dai-liquidity-provision-with-bunnis-rehypothecation-features/24823.rss","#text":"Enhancing DAI Liquidity Provision with Bunni's Rehypothecation Features"},"filter":false},{"title":"Analysis of Recent Market Downturn and Liquidations in MakerDAO Core System and SparkLend Protocol","dc:creator":"definikola","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Due to the recent substantial market decline, the SparkLend protocol experienced more liquidations in the past few days than it had over the entire previous year, while MakerDAO Core system experienced the most liquidations since April this year.

Additionally, we would need to wait for the ADs to submit their payment requests. However, the spell on August 22nd will likely include elements from the second phase of LitePSM, and we prefer not to overload that spell with more items unless necessary. Therefore, we plan to include these payments in the spell scheduled for August 8th.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we need the ADs to submit their payment requests before August 6th at 18:00 UTC. Payment requests submitted after this deadline will not be considered for the current month and will have to wait for the next one.</p>\n<p>Each payment request should include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Ethereum addresses to which the payments should be sent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The specific amounts of MKR and DAI to be distributed to the address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A description, clarifying the purpose of the payment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cryptographic signatures from their EA addresses for any new addresses to authorize them to receive future payments, including the text “Authorize [address] to receive payments” and a timestamp (this only needs to be done the first time an address is used).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cryptographic signature is not needed if the address is the EA address of the AD.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, at this point in the month, we do not yet have the exact amount of compensation that will be added to the buffer. However, we have performed an initial calculation that can serve as an approximation. Please note that since it has not been reviewed, it may be subject to change in the next two days. You can refer to the <strong>Max Payment Limit</strong> column to determine the maximum amount that can be requested for a payment.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"mkr-buffer-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#mkr-buffer-2\"></a>MKR Buffer</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Delegate</th>\n<th>Amount in Buffer at Month Start (MKR)</th>\n<th>Amount Added to AD Buffer (MKR)</th>\n<th>New Scaled Buffer Contents (MKR)</th>\n<th>Max Payment Limit (MKR)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>BLUE</td>\n<td>13.75</td>\n<td>13.75</td>\n<td>27.5</td>\n<td>13.75</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BONAPUBLICA</td>\n<td>0.25</td>\n<td>0.56</td>\n<td>0.81</td>\n<td>0.25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Byteron</td>\n<td>11.25</td>\n<td>0.93</td>\n<td>12.18</td>\n<td>11.25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cloaky</td>\n<td>26.82</td>\n<td>13.75</td>\n<td>40.57</td>\n<td>26.82</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JuliaChang</td>\n<td>3.75</td>\n<td>13.75</td>\n<td>17.5</td>\n<td>3.75</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PBG</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rocky</td>\n<td>1.13</td>\n<td>1.21</td>\n<td>2.34</td>\n<td>1.13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>vigilant</td>\n<td>0.13</td>\n<td>1.05</td>\n<td>1.18</td>\n<td>0.13</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"dai-buffer-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dai-buffer-3\"></a>DAI Buffer</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Delegate</th>\n<th>Amount in Buffer at Month Start (DAI)</th>\n<th>Amount Added to AD Buffer (DAI)</th>\n<th>New Scaled Buffer Contents (DAI)</th>\n<th>Max Payment Limit (DAI)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>BLUE</td>\n<td>54167</td>\n<td>54167</td>\n<td>108333</td>\n<td>54,167</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BONAPUBLICA</td>\n<td>1667</td>\n<td>3763</td>\n<td>5430</td>\n<td>1,667</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Byteron</td>\n<td>45000</td>\n<td>6183</td>\n<td>51183</td>\n<td>45,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cloaky</td>\n<td>54167</td>\n<td>54167</td>\n<td>108333</td>\n<td>54,167</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JuliaChang</td>\n<td>17500</td>\n<td>54167</td>\n<td>71667</td>\n<td>17,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PBG</td>\n<td>6667</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>6667</td>\n<td>6,667</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rocky</td>\n<td>7500</td>\n<td>8065</td>\n<td>15565</td>\n<td>7,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>vigilant</td>\n<td>833</td>\n<td>6989</td>\n<td>7823</td>\n<td>833</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Calculations can be found here - <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j9IXXCqIMHwHkZJPg8w1FsT4P5auMvHKGE6uFqQlFtM/edit?gid=1441993452#gid=1441993452\" class=\"inline-onebox\">NEW MakerDAO Aligned Delegates Tracker - Google Sheets</a></p>\n<p>You can also use this Dune dashboard to track the changes in the amount of MKR delegated to each AD during the month:<br>\n<a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3951035/6646959/\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://dune.com/queries/3951035/6646959/</a></p>\n<p>If the total compensation requested surpasses the budget after accounting for the required buffer amount, we will contact the AD to review and possibly revise their request.

Given MakerDAO’s significant role in the ecosystem; I wanted to start a discussion on how MakerDAO could contribute to this emerging sector.</p>\n<p>Currently; many users in the DeFi space face risks related to smart contract vulnerabilities; liquidity crises, and even market volatility. While platforms like Nexus Mutual and Cover Protocol offer insurance-like products; there is still a lot of; room for growth and inno;vation.</p>\n<p>This brings me to MakerDAO’s unique position. With its well-established governance framework, a diverse community, and a stablecoin that i;s widely trusted; MakerDAO could potentially offer more robust and accessible insurance solutions.</p>\n<p>One idea I have been contemplating is the creation of a new insurance product or feature within MakerDAO’s ecosystem. T;his could be similar to how DAI provides stability; but focused on providing insurance coverage for various DeFi activities. For example; we ;could explore creating a pooled insurance fund backed by DAI; where users can contribute DAI to earn rewards and simultaneously provide insurance coverage.</p>\n<p>What do you think are the biggest challenges in implementing DeFi insurance through MakerDAO? Are there any existing proposals or projects within the MakerDAO community that are exploring similar ideas? <img src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=12\" title=\":thinking:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":thinking:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>Also, I have gone through this post; <a href=\"https://blog.makerdao.com/nine-most-common-missteps-of-crypto-and-defi-users/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://blog.makerdao.com/nine-most-common-missteps-of-crypto-and-defi-users-</a><a href=\"https://www.igmguru.com/erp-training/sac-analytics-cloud-online-training/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sap/</a> which definitely helped me out a lot.</p>\n<p>How could we leverage MakerDAO’s strengths to offer more secure and user-friendly insurance options?</p>\n<p>Thankyou in advance for your help and assistance. <img src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/images/emoji/twitter/innocent.png?v=12\" title=\":innocent:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":innocent:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/could-someone-give-me-advice-exploring-the-potential-of-defi-insurance-with-makerdao/24764\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/could-someone-give-me-advice-exploring-the-potential-of-defi-insurance-with-makerdao/24764","pubDate":"Mon, 29 Jul 2024 13:51:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24764"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/could-someone-give-me-advice-exploring-the-potential-of-defi-insurance-with-makerdao/24764.rss","#text":"Could Someone Give me Advice Exploring the Potential of DeFi Insurance with MakerDAO?"},"filter":false},{"title":"RWA001 - Trust Sponsor","dc:creator":"mrabino1","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>With this vault scheduled to have its rate increased with the underlying stated intent of unwinding, the previous subsidy that was willing to be extended for the underlying Trust Sponsor (and its corporate services) will now also be coming to an end.</p>\n<p>This component is an important aspect to the overall structure.</p>\n<p>As 6s is exclusively a borrower, this lender related expense will need to be carried by another party including the unwinding process and its associated costs.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa001-trust-sponsor/24762\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa001-trust-sponsor/24762","pubDate":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 23:32:49 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24762"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa001-trust-sponsor/24762.rss","#text":"RWA001 - Trust Sponsor"},"filter":false},{"title":"[Jul 27, 2024] Proposed Changes to Spark for Upcoming Spell","dc:creator":"PhoenixLabs","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<h2><a name=\"summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Phoenix Labs proposes the following changes to SparkLend grouped by individual polls:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>[Mainnet] Activate Lido LST Interest Rate Model (IRM)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"rational-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#rational-2\"></a>Rational</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"mainnet-activate-lido-lst-interest-rate-model-irm-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#mainnet-activate-lido-lst-interest-rate-model-irm-3\"></a>[Mainnet] Activate Lido LST Interest Rate Model (IRM)</h3>\n<p>The ETH market in SparkLend has had to be manually updated to keep the kink at some fixed spread below the Lido LST yield.
