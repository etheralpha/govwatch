As a first step to become a truly self-sustainable project, Powerhouse was <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/professional-ecosystem-actor-introduction-powerhouse/21057\">introduced as an independent Ecosystem Actor in June 2023</a> when it spun off from the former <a href=\"https://expenses.makerdao.network/contributors/core-units/SES\">SES Core Unit</a>.

Our scope expanded with Endgame implementation, which demonstrated a broader need for more robust operational software across the ecosystem. This meant the development of a new platform that could create customizable interactions for organizational data input, along with tools and applications that repurposed, visualized and automated organizational data. This led to the development of Powerhouse’s “document models”, the fundamental data unit of the Powerhouse network, a decentralized synchronization protocol (DocSync), and four applications that leverage these technologies and work seamlessly together.</p>\n<p>As part of our work for Endgame, <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ea-status-update-2-3-powerhouse-work-for-makerdao/24712#rwa-reporting-tool-for-ba-labs-2\">Powerhouse built the RWA Reporting Tool</a> and now the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010\">Atlas Explorer pilot</a>, currently hosted at <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/\">https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/</a> .<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zDDaVoShfz21zsLGOzhRZyV9SmS.png?dl=1\" title=\"Atlas Portal displaying Atlas v2\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_345x272.png\" alt=\"Atlas Portal displaying Atlas v2\" data-base62-sha1=\"zDDaVoShfz21zsLGOzhRZyV9SmS\" width=\"345\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_345x272.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_517x408.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/9/f9c6f7b389d7f4791742136cc4adb1888e5db22a_2_690x544.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0EEF4\"></a></div><br>\nBoth of these tools make it easier for the broader community to understand granular details about different aspects of Sky’s operations beyond expense reporting - Powerhouse’s first use case. These two new tools show the flexibility of Powerhouse’s document model architecture and the need for customized operational software that can improve the efficiency and transparency of open organizations.<p></p>\n<p>Building on this experience, Powerhouse has begun to find product-market-fit outside of Sky with the launch of <a href=\"http://Arbgrants.com\">Arbgrants.com</a> (more in next section below). The needs of ArbitrumDAO were similar to the Sky Ecosystem albeit in a different operational domain (grants management). For both, there was a need to upgrade their operations, transparency, and data entry and monitoring. Specifically, moving from forums and spreadsheets to a customized web app with native authentication that does not create lock-in through a centralized data provider.</p>\n<p>Building out the grants management for Arbitrum is the beginning of productizing the Powerhouse platform. Yet, grant programs are only one segment of DAO operations. Powerhouse has found reception from other projects on building customized software to optimize their operations. Financial professionals, in particular, <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/ea-status-update-2-3-powerhouse-work-for-makerdao/24712/2\">have responded positively</a> to the availability of the complete revision history for any file, made possible by Powerhouse’s events-based architecture.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98841-arbgrants-enabling-accountability-for-arbitrum-dao-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98841-arbgrants-enabling-accountability-for-arbitrum-dao-3\"></a><strong>ArbGrants: Enabling accountability for Arbitrum DAO</strong></h2>\n<p>With the experience of building the RWA Reporting Tool for Sky, Powerhouse teamed up with StableLab to launch <a href=\"http://ArbGrants.com\">ArbGrants.com</a> in June to monitor Arbitrum’s Long Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP) and in August added the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). Arbitrum has been a leader in the DAO space in distributing grants to projects to encourage building on the protocol.</p>\n<p>Hoping to spur growth on Arbitrum, the DAO approved almost $100m to be distributed to participating projects through LTIPP and STIP, but did not yet have the necessary operational infrastructure to track how these funds were used and their effectiveness. <a href=\"https://stablelab.xyz/\">StableLab</a>, an active governance participant, was tasked with administering these programs. StableLab sought a solution more robust than spreadsheets and forum posts, and thought Powerhouse was the ideal partner.</p>\n<p>Powerhouse had been building a new set of applications to create process-oriented workflows to gather data in a simple and standardized UX, so this project presented an opportunity to build the second use case on the Powerhouse stack (the first being the RWA Reporting Tool for Sky)</p>\n<p>ArbGrants uses <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/renown\">Powerhouse’s Renown product</a> for authentication to ensure that only authorized users can submit ARB incentive reports. It generates a Decentralised Identifier (DID) based on one’s  Ethereum address and issues a credential on Ceramic. Project teams then submit their reports through <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/connect\">Powerhouse’s Connect product</a>, which uses the DocSync protocol to ensure the latest version of documents are displayed across the network for the grant program manager and community.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/6/a/6a0bfc008b104340fe9d9c3360a3c7a0fb1aacc0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/f88hSbFu0A5cCgJYKqImext4Ep2.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/a/6a0bfc008b104340fe9d9c3360a3c7a0fb1aacc0_2_690x387.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"f88hSbFu0A5cCgJYKqImext4Ep2\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/a/6a0bfc008b104340fe9d9c3360a3c7a0fb1aacc0_2_690x387.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/a/6a0bfc008b104340fe9d9c3360a3c7a0fb1aacc0_2_1035x580.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/6/a/6a0bfc008b104340fe9d9c3360a3c7a0fb1aacc0_2_1380x774.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CBCED4\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<p>Close to 100 projects have used <em>Renown</em> and <em>Connect</em> to submit biweekly reports. The high number of projects submitting reports has been an excellent stress test and proof of concept for Powerhouse’s Document Synchronization Protocol.</p>\n<p>Powerhouse’s work for ArbGrants is ongoing as we enhance user features and continue to improve UX. We believe that grants management tools are a key opportunity to build for other DAOs.  All Powerhouse’s software is open-source, and we are optimistic that we can leverage our experience building ArbGrants to make the tooling available to other projects.

A hackathon request called for greater budget transparency, so Powerhouse formed a group to develop a proposal based around our Fusion dashboard application.

They need legal infrastructure and a business model that can be sustainable for all parts of the ecosystem. We refer to this broader web of legal entities and value flows as a Scalable Network Organization (SNO).</p>\n<p>We have begun validating the SNO model by dogfooding with Powerhouse itself. We have recently set up an Operational Hub for Powerhouse contributors. This legal entity can accept funds from an unincorporated DAO or multisig and pay the service providers of the DAO or SNO. This makes it easy to recruit contributors and easily pay them in crypto or fiat. This new entity is an important first step to demonstrating the SNO model.</p>\n<p>We have also been working on other open-source legal templates to help projects streamline their early operations. We have completed work on an entity with membership conditions tied to a multisig participation agreement (MPA). This means that the members of our Operational Hub can be legally determined by signers of a multisig, an important liability step for an early project wanting to do onchain operations.</p>\n<p>We’ve started initial discussions with potential projects who are interested in applying the SNO model to their organization</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98841-powerhouse-outreach-and-next-opportunities-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98841-powerhouse-outreach-and-next-opportunities-6\"></a><strong>Powerhouse Outreach and Next Opportunities</strong></h2>\n<p>Powerhouse’s broad ambitions make it challenging to hone a message, but we are making progress.</p>\n<p>We have started to spread the Powerhouse message and build a community around optimizing operations and sustainability for open organizations. In May, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GnRqdoXt8o\">we organized Powerbrunch</a>, an event at Full Node in Berlin to showcase our work. And in July, in preparation for ETHCC, we <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/\">updated our website</a> and unveiled individual pages for each of our four products. In the next month, we will publish a series of blog posts on our core technologies (Document Models and our decentralized synchronization protocol, DocSync) and our public legal infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Now our focus is on reaching more builders and those in the trenches of operations for open organizations. On the development side, we are focused on reducing the cost of creating custom solutions for projects by enhancing the builder experience and improving the system’s stability performance.</p>\n<p>We are planning a side event in Bangkok alongside Devcon to provide an opportunity to grow our developer community by helping builders to play around with document models and DocSync.

What type of asset is it? (e.g. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token etc.)</strong></em></p>\n<p>The asset is a USYC - USD Yield-bearing token generating returns from its exposure to the United States Treasury Market. SDYF invests primarily in reverse repo and U.S. Government backed securities.</p>\n<p><em><strong>7. How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights)</strong></em></p>\n<p>Investors holding USYC are shareholders in the SDYF and have redemption rights to the underlying share of SDYF under Cayman’s law. Investors subscribe into the SDYF for participating shares at that day’s current price. Shareholders, including the DAO, would have rights under Cayman’s bankruptcy law to assets of the fund.</p>\n<p><em><strong>8.

Where does exchange for the asset occur?</strong></em></p>\n<p>For USDC and PYUSD one can mint via Hashnote’s “Teller” smart contracts for an atomic on-chain mint of USYC. Burning (redemption) can occur the same way via smart contract back into USDC or PYUSD.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, onboarded users can use a “manual” method of sending Hashnote fiat, USDC, USDT or PYUSD. Hashnote then mints into the investor’s wallet an amount of USYC tokens equivalent to the number of shares the investor has in the SDYF. Again, burning (redemption) occurs through the same path of the customer burning USYC and then being sent back their stablecoin or fiat.</p>\n<p>Instructions for above can be found at: <a href=\"https://usyc.docs.hashnote.com/overview/subscription-and-redemption\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Subscription &amp; Redemption | USYC</a></p>\n<p>The amount of USYC the investor receives is equal to the deposit amount divided by the current Price of USYC.

These sizes are refilled regularly.</p>\n<p>Exchange availability does not necessarily make sense given the fee-free availability through Hashnote vs the bid-offer that one would have to pay on exchange.</p>\n<p><em><strong>10.

If offchain (trusted) settlement: describe what are the involved entities, process and estimated time.</strong></em></p>\n<p>SDYF, backing USYC, holds overnight reverse repos and stablecoins. The nature of overnight reverse repo is that we are in cash 100% every day by about 7am US Eastern Time and thus can liquidate assets for redemptions on any business day without any slippage.

What is/are the expected use case(s) of the Dai generated by the vault?</strong></em></p>\n<p>We would like to move toward getting DAI used as collateral at centralized exchanges, where the majority of trading activity occurs. As USYC is accepted as collateral on exchanges, it will be of interest to be able to instant redeem USYC into stables. If Maker takes USYC as collateral, it gives an avenue for DAI inclusion in CEX market collateral.</p>\n<p><em><strong>15. What is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated?</strong></em></p>\n<p>This is unknown. Many parties will give some inflated estimate of what they will generate, but any answer to this question is either purely speculative or temporarily subsidized.</p>\n<p><em><strong>16. What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral?</strong></em></p>\n<p>USYC is being included in major exchanges. By being able to take USYC into treasury, and being an asset that can mint DAI, there appears additional pressure for exchanges to accept DAI as collateral.</p>\n<p>Hashnote will support Maker’s long-terms goals, as we effectively combine the “real” and “decentralized” worlds as well.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98839-legal-questions-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98839-legal-questions-7\"></a><strong>Legal Questions</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>17.

For redemptions, the Fund will remove USYC tokens corresponding to the number of Shares being redeemed from the investor’s Hashnote client wallet. If an investor holds USYC tokens in a whitelisted address, redemptions must be initiated by transferring the equivalent USYC tokens to a designated Fund redemption wallet.</p>\n<p>Transfers of USYC tokens between Hashnote client wallets and/or whitelisted addresses (whitelisted transfers) will be treated as Share transfers between the respective investors and recorded by the Administrator. The Investment Manager allows whitelisted transfers without prior authorization but may annul transfers violating regulatory obligations.</p>\n<p>The Investment Manager may declare non-whitelisted transfers ineffective, annulling them by burning the transferred USYC tokens and minting new tokens to the sender’s wallet.

Describe the product</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock Short-term Treasury Bill Token (STBT) is designed for accredited investors seeking exposure to US treasury yields. STBT is the first tokenized T-bill token issued in Asia, and currently yields approximately 5.10-5.30% APY on average (gross yield including fees, as of Aug 2024).</p>\n<p>Each STBT is pegged to 1 USD and is collateralized by a combination of the following instruments</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Matrixdock sources from a wide range of independent sources to ensure diversification. Allocations are made dynamically to optimize for stability and liquidity.</p>\n<p>STBT is an ERC-1400 token that distributes yield on a daily basis via re-basing, with T+1 minting and T+0 redemption. T+0 redemption is supported directly by Matrixdock and in secondary venues such as Curve.</p>\n<p>STBT is also the first to accept multiple stablecoins as deposit and redemption options, and <strong>the first to accept minting with DAI directly.</strong></p>\n<p>For STBT, Matrixdock works closely with Chainlink to deliver the best UX on DeFi</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proof of Reserves:</strong> STBT is the market’s first tokenized treasury token adopting Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves, enforcing the number of tokens minted is always less than or equal to the underlying NAV by smart contract, assuring investor confidence on-chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Data feed:</strong> STBT NAV data is recorded publicly on-chain and verified by Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network</li>\n<li><strong>CCIP:</strong> STBT is multi-chain enabled, available on Ethereum and Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>STBT is also committed to driving innovation in token utility. It serves as collateral for borrowing and lending, as well as for leveraging on selected platforms in both DeFi and CeFi, including Term Finance and <a href=\"http://bit.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bit.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the underlying asset</strong></p>\n<p>US Treasuries are considered the safest USD-denominated asset. STBT is built upon a basket of on-chain and off-chain instruments, which include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The inclusion of on-chain assets is designed to enhance liquidity and provide added flexibility to the portfolio, complementing the stability of off-chain assets. Based on Matrixdock’s professional asset management experience, allocations are made dynamically to optimize for product yield, stability and liquidity. A small amount of cash is kept to facilitate basic liquidity needs.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How is yield transferred to the token holder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock distributes yield daily through the rebase of STBT in holders token balances. STBT is pegged to 1 USD, and total STBT supply is increased to reflect increasing NAV.</p>\n<p>Total STBT supply is equivalent to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying asset portfolio, which equates to the sum of the market value of US T-bills, reverse repos, BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and cash.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT adopts a bankruptcy remote SPV structure, where issuer and custodian are separate entities with token holders owning complete legal rights to claim against custodied assets, to ensure 100% fund segregation and investor protection for all token holders.</p>\n<p><strong>Trust:</strong> Prometheus Solutions Purpose Trust (Seychelles)</p>\n<p><strong>Issuer:</strong> Prometheus Solutions Ltd (Seychelles)</p>\n<p><strong>Custodian:</strong> Epimetheus Technologies SPC (Cayman)</p>\n<p><strong>Enforcer/Protector:</strong> Hamilton Services Limited (United Kingdom)</p>\n<p><strong>Brokers:</strong> StoneX (United States), UBS (United Kingdom), Securitize (United States - for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) by BlackRock)</p>\n<p><strong>5. What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock sources T-bills from multiple sources off-chain and on-chain. Based on extensive professional asset management experience, Matrixdock allocates dynamically based on asset characteristics to optimise for yield, stability and liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Asset eligibility:</strong> Only assets that are US Treasuries within 3 month maturities, tokens representing US Treasuries, Repos and Cash are eligible for STBT.</p>\n<p>Currently, STBT accepts the following assets</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6. Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the use of hedging or derivatives is not permitted. The underlying portfolio only accepts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short term US Treasury bills (with maturities of 3 months or less)</li>\n<li>Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries</li>\n<li>BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A small amount of cash is kept to facilitate basic liquidity needs.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency? If so, describe how they work.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, Matrixdock adopts a hybrid allocation approach to optimize for STBT yield, stability and liquidity. Matrixdock has partnered with the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency - supporting T+1 minting and T+0 redemptions.</p>\n<p>For instant redemption, redeemed STBT are swapped into the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on-chain then into USDC (rather than settled off-chain from T-bills).</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary liquidity</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, Matrixdock supports a $3M STBT-3pool on Curve to facilitate immediate swaps.</p>\n<p>One advantage with Matrixdock is its established network of relationships with liquidity providers, market makers and institutions. Matrixdock has a proven track record of supporting significant single day redemptions of up to $50M even outside market hours.</p>\n<p><strong>16. With what product can subscriptions and redemptions be made? (i.e., fiat, Dai, USDC, etc.)</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock supports USDC, USDT and DAI for subscriptions and redemptions. Fiat is also accepted, subject to OTC terms and fees. Matrixdock can also support licensed legally-compliant third party OTCs.</p>\n<p>Matrixdock acknowledges that MakerDao has rebranded into Sky, and will be upgrading DAI to USDS. With a successful DeFi treasury allocation, Matrixdock can accelerate USDS support within the Matrixport ecosystem and directly as a subscription/redemption currency for STBT.</p>\n<p><strong>17. What are your future development plans for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is increasingly being used in treasury management by institutional investors and DAOs.</p>\n<p>For future development, Matrixdock will focus on four fronts</p>\n<p><strong>i. Greater Efficiencies:</strong></p>\n<p>By partnering with top-tier custodians, Matrixdock will enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and mitigate risk. This global approach ensures that our assets are safeguarded across multiple jurisdictions, delivering superior security standards while optimizing asset management processes.</p>\n<p><strong>ii. More Diverse User Base:</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock will grow the STBT user base by forming strategic partnerships with top-tier institutional platforms and digital exchanges. As the user base expands, the whitelist pool will grow, allowing more users to transact with each other. This whitelisting mechanism ensures that only approved users can hold and trade STBT tokens within the secure, compliant ecosystem. By broadening the pool of whitelisted users, we aim to enhance the liquidity and accessibility of STBT, fostering a more dynamic and diverse marketplace. By expanding the network of compliant users, Matrixdock aims to foster collaboration and unlock additional growth potential within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>iii. Deeper Liquidity:</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock is committed to deepening liquidity by increasing partnerships with top liquidity providers and market makers. Additionally, we plan to scale our Curve pool and raise transaction caps, ensuring seamless liquidity, even during periods of heightened demand.</p>\n<p><strong>iv. Greater DeFi Utility:</strong></p>\n<p>To expand DeFi utility, Matrixdock plans to integrate STBT with leading decentralized protocols, positioning it as a strong collateral option for lending and perpetual markets. Additionally, we envision STBT being used as an underlying asset for other innovative products, such as yield-generating strategies and structured financial instruments, further enhancing its versatility and value across the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<h1>IV.

This means that, even in the unlikely event of Matrixdock’s insolvency, the assets held by the STBT entities would remain fully protected and would not be subject to any claims from Matrixdock’s creditors.</p>\n<p>The STBT entities are designed as special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that exclusively manage the STBT program. These entities incur no liabilities other than their obligations to STBT token holders, which are their sole focus. Additionally, the number of STBT tokens issued will always be less than the value of the underlying reserves held by these entities.</p>\n<p>With these safeguards in place, the STBT entities are considered bankruptcy remote, ensuring maximum security for token holders. This legal structure provides a robust level of protection, isolating the assets backing the STBT tokens from any potential risks associated with Matrixdock.</p>\n<p>For further details about these entities, please feel free to request additional information via email.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong></p>\n<p>Holders of STBT tokens have a right to a debt obligation from the token issuer. Each STBT token is redeemable for an amount equivalent to one U.S. dollar, minus any applicable fees, trading losses, or transactional costs. The redemption value reflects the pro rata value of the underlying assets at the time of redemption.</p>\n<p>When you redeem your STBT tokens, the amount you receive will be based on the value of the underlying assets at that time, after accounting for any necessary fees and costs associated with the sale of these assets. Please note that there may be additional redemption restrictions that apply.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No, there are no pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or MakerDAO</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is subject to taxation at the user’s applicable tax rate, which depends on the user’s jurisdiction and legal setup.

Describe the technical implementation of your product</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract Framework</strong></p>\n<p>The permission framework of the STBT contract is broadly classified into three distinct roles: ControllerRole, IssuerRole, ModeratorRole. The proposal is to designate a single smart contract with a timelock function as the controller contract for all three roles. All STBT administrator activities are carried out via this controller contract, with each operation subject to two stages of proposing and executing, and the execution must conform to the delay specified by the timelock. The overall structure is as follows:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uqnHKuANHGaxVE9y1XMcwsk1uRW.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_624x351.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uqnHKuANHGaxVE9y1XMcwsk1uRW\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_624x351.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_936x526.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/5/d53caddb81538a7f51faf7bf07739cd8a4900040_2_1248x702.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F6FC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Timelock contract: There is a single external control smart contract with a timelock function as the controller contract, through which all STBT administrator activities are carried out. Each operation must go through two stages of proposing and executing, with execution conforming to the 4-hour delay specified by the timelock.</p>\n<p>The timelock contract is the only admin, and the security of the STBT contract is normalized to the security of each role involved in the timelock controller: proposer, executor, and canceller. The canceller is one self-hosted hardware wallet that is authorized to cancel an operation scheduled during the timelock period by calling the timelock controller.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Standard</strong></p>\n<p>ERC1400 standard is split into several modular sub-standards：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ERC1410 defines partially fungible tokens where balances of tokens can have an associated metadata</li>\n<li>ERC1594 defines transfer restrictions and core security token functionality</li>\n<li>ERC1643 defines document management functionality.</li>\n<li>ERC1644 defines controller operation functionality</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular, the STBT token contract implements the ERC1594 transfer restrictions specs, and the ERC1644 controller operations specs. STBT utilizes the whitelist mechanism to determine whether transmission and reception of addresses are authorized.</p>\n<p><strong>STBT Risk Mitigation and Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>STBT mitigates contract and operational risks through the implementation of a whitelist mechanism, time-lock contracts, and an independent real-time monitoring system, ensuring the highest level of safety and security.</p>\n<p>In order to further prevent operational and hacking risks, Matrixdock has implemented two separated sets of monitoring systems:</p>\n<p>A. The first system monitors the difference between the business order data and the contract activity data to detect any unauthorized minting of STBT tokens. Any suspicious activity can be immediately canceled, and emergency plans activated.</p>\n<p>B. The second system monitors the difference between the confirmation fiat wiring amount and the contract activity data. This monitoring service is independently maintained and monitored to identify any anomaly.</p>\n<p>The STBT minter contract only allows whitelisted wallets to call this contract directly and mint/redeem STBT. In this way, all key actions initiated through the minter contract, such as Mint, Burn, Settle, will be transparently tracked on-chain, ensuring full transparency and allowing for the tracking of all capital flows and information related to the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What audits have been performed on the smart contracts involved with your product, by whom, and when?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT’s smart contract has been audited by BlockSec (Jan 2023) and <a href=\"http://Zellic.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Zellic.io</a> (Feb 2023).

Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</strong></p>\n<p>While Matrixdock itself has not yet engaged directly with MakerDAO in formal partnerships, our parent company, Matrixport, has a deep-rooted history in the crypto and blockchain space. Matrixport’s extensive experience in managing complex crypto financial products and infrastructure has provided Matrixdock with valuable insights into the operational dynamics of decentralized platforms. Over the years, Matrixport has maintained a positive relationship with MakerDAO, entering exploratory discussions on multiple fronts, including but not limited to Real-World Assets (RWA).</p>\n<p>Recognizing MakerDAO’s significant influence in the DeFi space, we have made the strategic decision to accept DAI as the token for minting STBT. This decision underscores our commitment to aligning with MakerDAO’s ecosystem and catering to its extensive user base.</p>\n<p>With our team’s expertise in navigating both traditional finance and digital assets, we are well-positioned to collaborate with DAOs. Our proven track record with other reputable DAOs demonstrates our ability to navigate DAO governance, meet KYC requirements, and deliver financial products that uphold the high transparency and security standards demanded by decentralized organizations like MakerDAO. Matrixdock also has experience working with a wide range of legal structures, including LLPs, corporations, trusts, and other legal entities, further reinforcing our capability to support MakerDAO’s strategic objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT brings more than just yield to the MakerDAO ecosystem. By integrating STBT into MakerDAO’s treasury, MakerDAO gains access to a robust, real-world asset-backed product that enhances overall treasury stability and liquidity. Our industry-leading transparency practices, including the unique Transparency Panel and Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves, reinforce the trust and reliability that MakerDAO’s stakeholders expect.</p>\n<p>Importantly, STBT can also be minted using DAI, MakerDAO’s stablecoin. This creates a seamless integration that not only strengthens the utility and demand for DAI but also allows MakerDAO to leverage its own stablecoin in acquiring STBT, further solidifying its role in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In addition to STBT, Matrixdock is committed to expanding its portfolio of real-world asset (RWA) products, further deepening our collaboration with MakerDAO in the future. By launching new RWA offerings tailored to the needs of decentralized ecosystems, we aim to provide MakerDAO with a broader range of asset-backed products that enhance stability and liquidity. This evolving suite of RWA solutions will not only support MakerDAO’s treasury diversification goals but also create new opportunities for long-term cooperation and growth within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Integrating STBT can also attract a broader range of institutional and retail participants from Matrixport’s ecosystem, who prioritize the security and stability of RWA-backed assets. Additionally, MakerDAO can leverage Matrixdock’s extensive RWA network in Asia, gaining access to traditional finance resources like Asia OTC, asset sourcing, and community building.</p>\n<p>This broader participation could help to further diversify and strengthen MakerDAO’s treasury, aligning with long-term strategic goals of risk management and capital efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is designed with secure interoperability in mind, and it is already integrated into different DeFi verticals such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DEX for swaps and liquidity provisioning ie Curve</li>\n<li>Collateral for stablecoins ie Verified USD</li>\n<li>Collateral for borrowing/lending ie Term Finance</li>\n<li>Multi-chain mobility ie CCIP including Ethereum and Arbitrum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond DeFi, STBT’s compatibility with traditional financial systems is facilitated through our OTC network and a growing range of RWA products, which is part of our broader strategy to create a seamless interface between fiat and crypto worlds. Matrixdock’s infrastructure is built to support easy integration across multiple platforms, ensuring that STBT remains a versatile and secure asset within both DeFi and traditional finance ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Matrixdock is committed to bringing the best-in-quality real-world assets on-chain, with the T-bill token being just the beginning of our journey in RWAs. We are actively developing a suite of tokenized RWAs designed to meet the specific needs of decentralized ecosystems. Our vision is to expand our offerings with a range of products tailored to the diverse risk preferences of MakerDAO ecosystem participants.</p>\n<p>These upcoming products will provide portfolio managers with a broader spectrum of investment options, making them ideal for SparkDAO and other MakerDAO subDAOs seeking to diversify their treasury assets, optimize returns, and enhance capital efficiency. Our dedication to security, transparency, and seamless integration of real-world assets positions us as a key partner in supporting MakerDAO’s treasury management with the highest standards of innovation and stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Supplementary</strong></p>\n<p>STBT Transparency Panel is the first in the industry to leverage on recognized third-party independent oversight to enhance greater transparency.

name=\"p-98784-introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://x.com/SkyEcosystem/status/1828405625828843710\">Sky Ecosystem Launch Announcement</a> on August 27, 2024, Sky has officially entered Launch Season. As we proceed with the Token and Product Launch, which is the beginning spell of many upcoming upgrades to the protocol, it is essential for the Sky Ecosystem to finalize and agree on a set of key parameters. In this post, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> provides an overview of the initial set of necessary changes and additions to the protocol, specified in the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/endgame-announcing-the-token-and-product-launch/25021/1\">Endgame: Announcing the Token and Product Launch forum post</a>.</p>\n<p>This proposal assumes the ratification of the upcoming <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010\">Atlas V2 Upgrade</a>, which will be polled at the same time as this parameter proposal, meaning that the upgrade is based on the decentralized governance process of the Sky Ecosystem. Assuming the passing of mentioned Atlas V2 Upgrade and this parameter proposal, the parameters will be included in the Out-of-Schedule executive vote on September 13, as requested by the Stability Facilitator, assuming their final confirmation and satisfaction regarding recommended details below. The Executive Vote will utilize the schedule method, which allows for the spell to be executed after a specified time, which still requires the GSM delay passing.</p>\n<p>In summary, this post covers the following items (find attached corresponding GitHub Repos, which include README files that explain all technical details):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Token contracts and corresponding token converters\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sdai/tree/susds\">USDS</a> (Upgraded DAI)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sky\">SKY</a> (Upgraded MKR)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The introduction of the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sdai/tree/snst\">Sky Savings Rate (sUSDS)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-flappers/tree/dev\">Smart Burn Engine</a> upgrade and <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/univ2-pool-migrator\">pool migration</a> to the new tokens</li>\n<li>The introduction of <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/endgame-toolkit/blob/master/README.md#farms\">Sky Token Rewards (STR)</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Use USDS to get SKY</li>\n<li>Use USDS to get 01 rewardsToken</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.8.2_Governance_Security_Delay_Requirements-9349994e-9918-494c-9e9a-e993082ae055%7C0db30758\">GSM Delay</a> Changes</li>\n<li>Corresponding <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/\">Atlas V2</a> Active Data Updates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about Launch Season, refer to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/makerdao-endgame-launch-season-final/24740\">MakerDAO Endgame: Launch Season (final)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959\">Sky has arrived!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010\">Atlas V2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/endgame-announcing-the-token-and-product-launch/25021/1\">Endgame: Announcing the Token and Product Launch forum post</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98784-summary-of-deployments-and-proposed-parameters-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-summary-of-deployments-and-proposed-parameters-2\"></a>Summary of Deployments and Proposed Parameters</h2>\n<p>BA Labs, acting as Stability Scope Advisor, recommends the Stability Facilitator to include the following parameter changes and contract initializations in a Governance Poll.

While DAI will remain active, users will be able to upgrade to USDS if they wish to access all the new features in the Sky Ecosystem. Similarly, users will be able to convert USDS to DAI. The exchange rate for DAI/USDS will be 1:1. It is important to note that USDS is upgradable by the decentralized governance process of the Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Learn more about USDS and its associated contracts in the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/nst?tab=readme-ov-file#nst-token-and-contracts-associated\">USDS Github repository</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>SKY:</strong> SKY is the new governance token associated with the Sky Ecosystem. MKR will remain active and users will be able to upgrade MKR and SKY (and optionally convert back to MKR) using the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/ngt?tab=readme-ov-file#mkrngt\">MkrSky converter</a>. The MKR/SKY exchange rate will be 1:24,000. The SKY token is not upgradable.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the SKY token and its associated contracts in the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/ngt\">SKY Github repository</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>sUSDS:</strong> sUSDS is a tokenized implementation of the Sky Savings Rate (SSR). To access the Sky Savings Rate (SSR) and accumulate additional USDS, users supply USDS and receive sUSDS in return.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.3.2.2.3.1_Sky_Savings_Rate_Formula-82f9fb39-cc69-4bde-bb0f-ec34ca02ad28%7C57eab733e951bb59\">Atlas V2 A.3.2.2.3.1</a>, the Sky Savings Rate (SSR) formula is: Dai Savings Rate (DSR) + <code>USDS Spread</code>. The <code>USDS Spread</code> value is 0.25%. At the time of writing, the DSR is 6%, which means that the initial SSR value will be 6.25%.</p>\n<p>Learn more about sUSDS in the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/sdai/tree/susds\">sUSDS Github repository</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98784-pool-migration-and-flapper-init-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-pool-migration-and-flapper-init-5\"></a>Pool Migration and Flapper Init</h3>\n<p>In order for the Smart Burn Engine to support USDS and SKY, a number of contract deployments and parameter changes are needed. These are outlined below.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98784-pool-migration-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-pool-migration-6\"></a>Pool Migration</h4>\n<p>The pool migration will initiate after the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/univ2-pool-migrator\">univ2-pool-migrator</a> script has been called. It is also worth noting that all funds will be migrated at once without any seed liquidity, since it is not required as was the case when Smart Burn Engine was first initiated.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the pool migration, refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/univ2-pool-migrator\">univ2-pool-migrator Github repository</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98784-flapper-initialization-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-flapper-initialization-7\"></a>Flapper Initialization</h4>\n<p>Similar to the functionality of the existing Smart Burn Engine, Sky’s new Dss Flappers can exchange surplus USDS to SKY, and optionally add both USDS and SKY to a USDS/SKY UniswapV2 pool. With the new implementation, some key changes will be made, outlined below.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"p-98784-splitter-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-splitter-8\"></a>Splitter</h5>\n<p>As opposed to the old SBE design, where a <code>kick</code> operation leads to <code>DAI</code> being withdrawn from the <code>vow</code> and subsequently used to buy <code>gem</code> tokens on Uniswap V2, the new SBE design first goes through the <code>splitter</code>. The <code>splitter</code> exposes a <code>kick</code> operation to be triggered periodically (determined by the <code>hop</code> parameter). When triggered, <code>USDS</code> is withdrawn from the <code>vow</code> and split into two parts: (i) a <code>burn</code> part, which is sent to the underlying <code>flapper</code> contract, and (ii) a <code>WAD - burn</code> part, which can be distributed to a <code>farm</code> contract. The <code>farm</code> is related to Sealed Activation Rewards and is not related to Sky Token Rewards which are part of this spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Splitter Parameters:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>burn</code>: The percentage of the <code>vow.bump</code> to be moved to the underlying <code>flapper</code>. For example, a value of 0.70 * <code>WAD</code> corresponds to funneling 70% of the <code>USDS</code> to the burn engine. Will initially be set to <code>100% (1.0 * WAD)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>hop</code>: Minimum interval in seconds between kicks. Will initially be set to 10,249 seconds.</li>\n<li><code>flapper</code>: The underlying burned strategy. Will initially be set to <code>FlapperUniV2</code>.</li>\n<li><code>farm</code>: The staking rewards contract receiving the rewards, which will be defined in a later phase when Sealed Activation will be implemented.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><a name=\"p-98784-flapper-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-flapper-9\"></a>Flapper</h5>\n<p>The <code>flapper</code> is the underlying burner strategy of the SBE. There are currently two strategies defined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-flappers/tree/dev\">Dss Flappers Github repository</a>. <code>FlapperUniV2</code> will remain the chosen <code>flapper</code> strategy. Furthermore, the <code>receiver</code> address will remain the <code>MCD_PAUSE_PROXY: 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>FlapperUniV2 Parameters:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pip</code>: A reference price oracle, used for bounding the exchange rate of the swap.</li>\n<li><code>want</code>: Relative multiplier of the reference price needed for the swap. For example, 0.98 * WAD allows for a 2% worse price than the oracle price. Will initially be set to <code>0.98</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><a name=\"p-98784-splittermom-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-splittermom-10\"></a>SplitterMom</h5>\n<p>A new Mom contract has been developed for the Smart Burn Engine in the Sky Ecosystem, referred to as <code>SplitterMom</code>. This contract allows bypassing the governance delay when disabling the Splitter in an emergency.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"p-98784-oraclewrapper-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-oraclewrapper-11\"></a>OracleWrapper</h5>\n<p>Allows for scaling down an oracle price by a certain value. This can be useful when the <code>gem</code> is a redenominated version of an existing token, which already has a reliable oracle.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the Flapper initialization, refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-flappers/tree/dev\">Dss Flappers Github repository</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98784-sky-token-rewards-str-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-sky-token-rewards-str-12\"></a>Sky Token Rewards (STR)</h3>\n<p>When USDS is deposited to farm other Sky Ecosystem tokens, it is referred to as “Sky Token Rewards” (STR). For the Token and Product Launch, two Sky Token Reward (STR) contracts will be deployed: (i) STR (SKY) and (ii) STR (01 rewardsToken). These are explained in further detail below.</p>\n<p>To learn about Sky Token Rewards (STR), refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/endgame-toolkit/blob/master/README.md#farms\">Endgame Toolkit GitHub Repository</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98784-sky-token-rewards-sky-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-sky-token-rewards-sky-13\"></a>Sky Token Rewards (SKY)</h4>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.4.5.2_USDS_Rewards-84d14606-b3f3-4dc0-8f75-ca8d7128a391%7Cb3415bc1a125\">Atlas V2 A.4.5.2 - USDS Rewards</a>, the planned Token Rewards rate to participating USDS holders will be 600 million SKY tokens per year.</p>\n<p>The cap parameter is defined as the max rate of spending, or in other words, the maximum value for safety. A case can be made to set the cap parameter higher than the planned 600 million SKY tokens per year. Hence, we believe that a value of 800 million SKY per year is appropriate. Such change is subject to decentralizer process of Sky Governance.</p>\n<p>The start date of STR (SKY) is set to be relevant to the spell cast block timestamp minus 7 days, by configuring DssVest which is minting rewards to the staking contract. The accrued token rewards in the DssVest are distributed to the StakingReward contract by calling a permissionless function. The specific DssVest start time configuration prior to spell cast time is due to the nature of algorithm in the StakingRewards contract and frequency of vested tokens being distributed, with intent to normalize SKY Token Rewards yield as soon as possible.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98784-sky-token-rewards-01-rewards-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98784-sky-token-rewards-01-rewards-14\"></a>Sky Token Rewards (01 Rewards)</h4>\n<p>Similarly to STR (SKY), STR (01 Rewards) will allow USDS holders to deposit USDS to receive 01 rewardsToken over time. On a technical level the rewardsToken is set to <code>address(0)</code>. These Token Rewards will be calculated off-chain and distributed later in time via special contract.

Company Details</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Company description</p>\n<p>Dinari is a tokenized asset issuer providing open access to trusted assets, such as US stocks &amp; ETFs, with fractional shares &amp; dividend distributions. We work with a variety of technology and finance businesses, both web2 and web3 companies, to bring new assets to their customers. Dinari was founded in 2021 and is a registered SEC transfer agent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Key personnel biographies</p>\n<p>Gabriel Otte (CEO): Previously, Gabriel was a biotech founder of Freenome ($10B Biotech), a multi-billion dollar cancer diagnostic developer. He stepped back as CEO in 2021 as the company was preparing to IPO. He has been contemplating the ways in which we can globalize the stock exchange through the blockchain since 2016, working to formulate the idea with Balaji Srinivasan who was a friend building a biotech company next door to Freenome at the time. The establishment of the first version of RWAs (mainly stablecoins) and their high market cap makes Gabriel believe that this is finally the time that a global RWA exchange will take off. His previous dealings with regulators has proven valuable navigating the difficult regulatory challenges of Dinari. Gabriel holds a BA in Computational Biology and Chemistry from Cornell University and attended University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine for graduate studies before withdrawing to start Freenome.</p>\n<p>Jake Timothy (CTO): Jake began his career at Northrop Grumman’s aerospace division, where he led the development of sophisticated data-driven systems. These systems were pivotal in enhancing operational coordination internally and for the warfighter, including significantly increasing production rates for fighter jets amounting to billions of dollars in orders. In the realm of cryptocurrency, Jake was an early adopter, trading Bitcoin in 2011. He re-entered the crypto space in 2017 creating advanced trading algorithms and developing smart contracts. His expertise in decentralized finance led to the creation of a smart contract-based equity protocol, laying the foundation for Dinari’s flagship product, the dShares tokenized stocks platform. Jake holds an MS in spacecraft navigation and control from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.</p>\n<p>Chas Rampenthal (CLO): From 2003 to 2021, Chas served LegalZoom in several roles. Initially, as General Counsel, he managed the Company’s legal functions, including corporate transactions, litigation, regulatory, intellectual property, government relations, employment, legal ethics, and compliance. During his last two years, Chas served as Segment Leader for the Attorney Asist Segment and as Head of Industry Relations. During his time at LegalZoom, Chas wrote a regular column for Inc. Magazine Online, and co-hosted Legally Bound – a live call-in Los Angeles talk radio program on KTLK and KABC. Chas is a member of the CA and MA bars. He earned his bachelor’s degree in economics and math studies summa cum laude from Southern Illinois University and his JD from the University of Southern California. Prior to his legal career, Chas served honorably in the United States Navy as an officer and naval aviator, where he flew multiple Outlaw Hunter combat missions in support of Operation Desert Storm.</p>\n<p>Brandon Ooi (CPO): Previously, Brandon was co-founder and CTO of Crunchyroll ($1B+ exit to Sony) an anime streaming and distribution company. He was instrumental in growing the company from the original 4 people to over 200 managing many aspects of engineering, product and infrastructure. He is a seasoned engineer with leadership roles at a number of startups including HOTorNOT (acquired by AM), Rune (CTO), Sharespace (CTO, acquired by Stripe) and SambaTV (Director of Engineering). With expertise spanning from consumer technology to enterprise fintech/compliance and experience at Stripe (3 years, platform/marketplace experience), he has always had a special interest in building real web3 financial products backed by real world assets. Brandon holds a degree from the UC Berkeley College of Engineering EECS program with a minor in Bioengineering.</p>\n<p>Garrett Wong (CFO): Garrett has held a number of finance leadership and investing roles, primarily in the technology industry. Previously, he was Chief Financial Officer at Teiko Bio. Prior, Garrett was at Shutterfly, where he led corporate development and investor relations and ran strategic finance for one of its business units. While at Shutterfly, Garrett led the company’s $225 million acquisition of Spoonflower and raised over $1 billion financing. Prior to Shutterfly, Garrett was a venture capital investor at Hewlett Packard Pathfinder, investing in and serving on the Boards of growth-stage tech startups.

Product Information</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Describe the product</p>\n<p>USFR.d is a Dinari issued token that is 1:1 backed by the WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund, USFR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Describe the underlying asset</p>\n<p>USFR - WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund<br>\nWisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund seeks to track the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Bond Index.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides cost-effective access to newly issued US government floating rate notes</li>\n<li>Designed to fluctuate with short-term rates and are priced at a spread over 3-mo Treasury Bills</li>\n<li>Short-term government bond solution that fluctuates with most recent 3-mo Treasury Bills</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</p>\n<p>Dividend yield is distributed as soon as it is available. Dinari does not hold back distributions or speculate on future yield. USFR.d yield is accrued from the underlying asset monthly and distributed as soon as it is available.</p>\n<p>Investors have a choice in how their yield is transferred. Yield is distributed by Dinari to USFR.d token holders in one of two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stablecoin distribution: Yield is transferred to the tokenholder by distributions of our USD+ stablecoin to the holding wallet. USD+ can be reinvested, redeemed for USDC, or held to accrue additional interest.</li>\n<li>Token accrual: If USFR.d is wrapped (USFR.dw), the yield will be automatically reinvested and accrued to the vault as additional USFR.d tokens which are reified upon unwrapping. This increases the exchange rate between USFR.d and USFR.dw such that the increase in exchange rate corresponds to the yield accrued.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: Wrapping from USFR.d to USFR.dw increases compatibility and composability with DeFi. Wrapped dShares are able to account for rebasing changes to the underlying stock such as stock splits/reverse splits and continue to provide yield even when staked or otherwise used in DeFi protocols. You are able to wrap and unwrap dShares at <a href=\"http://sbt.dinari.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sbt.dinari.com</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</p>\n<p>The issuer Dinari, Inc is incorporated in the United States.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</p>\n<p>Dinari offers dShares including USFR.d to countries outside the US and excluding regions identified in the unsupported countries list (<a href=\"https://docs.dinari.com/user-guide/unsupported-countries\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.dinari.com/user-guide/unsupported-countries</a>).<br>\nWe currently do not limit investment concentration.

This is primarily due to the slowness of moving fiat USD through the traditional finance system.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/5/55aff640ee2c5745d452253703053269bb0d76be.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ce1A3YOyyL6Q5Dc5X7f385IgdyK.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/5/55aff640ee2c5745d452253703053269bb0d76be_2_294x536.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ce1A3YOyyL6Q5Dc5X7f385IgdyK\" width=\"294\" height=\"536\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/5/55aff640ee2c5745d452253703053269bb0d76be_2_294x536.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/5/55aff640ee2c5745d452253703053269bb0d76be_2_441x804.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/5/5/55aff640ee2c5745d452253703053269bb0d76be_2_588x1072.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6FA\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency?

Dinari Vault Inc. will be an independent but wholly-owned subsidiary of Dinari Ltd. and protected from creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. Dinari Ltd. will operate a segregated account under Bermuda’s Segregated Accounts Companies Act (SAC Act) of 2000, with an independent segregated account representative as required by law. This is a high-priority feature and we expect completion in Q3 of 2024.</p>\n<p>Dinari issues over 40 different asset tokens representing a wide range of US securities from technology companies to commodities ETFs and beyond.

We have added custom logic to manage transfer restrictions of our tokens so we are able to fulfill our AML commitments and regulatory compliance, as well as control minting and burning permissions.</p>\n<p>The Dinari automated fulfillment system listens for new orders from the OrderProcessor smart contract. When a new order is created, the order is validated including checking that the user has passed KYC and AML checks. Then an order for the underlying asset, USFR, is placed with our brokerage. If the order for USFR is filled successfully, the order is filled and closed onchain. Final fees are specified and collected during order fill.</p>\n<p>The backend processes that monitor for orders and complete fulfillment store more detailed information on the state of the order. Dinari provides a REST API that makes order information available for enterprise users. The API is also useful for placing orders programmatically as it provides price quotes, fee quotes, and the token list.

MakerDAO Ecosystem</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Describe any previous relationship with MakerDAO and familiarity working with DAOs</p>\n<p>We actively work with AllianceDAO who are investors in Dinari. We have also previously received grants from the Arbitrum Foundation and are in active discussions with several DAOs to be a yield-bearing provider for their treasury management.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the SparkDAO and/or MakerDAO ecosystem?</p>\n<p>Dinari can offer the SparkDAO/MakerDAO ecosystem a broad range of assets. For treasuries or users who would like exposure to higher levels of yield, we can bring fixed income funds onchain that target other types of bonds. We also provide exposure to commodity funds and index funds, enabling more diverse inflation protection strategies.</p>\n<p>As we launch leveraged trading and staking pools for USDC and other assets, we will offer attractive stablecoin yields fueled by traders borrowing against dShares. These pools may have a more attractive risk profile than other crypto staking pools since the assets are backed by stocks and other highly liquid assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</p>\n<p>USFR.d represents one of our most important asset classes and is the primary treasury component for USD+, Dinari’s yield-bearing stablecoin. It also acts as a “cash-sweep” investment for uninvested currency.</p>\n<p>Selected Dinari dShares are currently traded on the Camelot DEX on Arbitrum One.<br>\ndShares, including USFR.d, are also offered to end users through our distribution and aggregation partners. These partners integrate with our APIs and span a range of financial service providers including neobanks, payroll providers, and trading apps. Examples include Cadana, Offramp, and Kinto.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other SubDAOs?</p>\n<p>DAOs and their treasuries may be interested in diversifying their portfolio beyond T-bills products. We provide access to other fixed income products, REITS, commodity funds, index funds, and more.

We request the Governance Facilitators (<a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ee-gov-facilitator\">@EE-Gov-Facilitator</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/jansky\">@JanSky</a>) to please prepare a Governance Poll for this coming Monday to allow voters to review and approve the next-generation Atlas (”Atlas v2”).</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98719-atlas-v2-structure-whats-new-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98719-atlas-v2-structure-whats-new-1\"></a>Atlas v2 Structure: What’s New</h1>\n<p>The Atlas v2 reflects a significant structural change compared to v1. In the Atlas v1, there was the Atlas Immutable Alignment Artifact; and apart from that, there were five separate Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifacts for each of the Scopes. The Atlas v2 unifies into one artifact the immutable logic of the Atlas and the mutable logic of the five Scopes.</p>\n<p>In the new Atlas v2, documents are the basic units for structuring data. The five Atlas v1 Scopes are each represented in v2 as a set of Articles. Each Article, in turn, has a set of subdocuments, including Sections and Primary Documents. Atlas v2 introduces a new modular structure of Supporting Documents, which help clarify the logic of their Parent Documents.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98719-amending-the-atlas-v2-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98719-amending-the-atlas-v2-2\"></a>Amending the Atlas v2</h1>\n<p>We want to highlight some of the notable avenues for amending the Atlas v2. (This is not an exhaustive list, so we encourage you to hop over to the Atlas Portal, linked below!)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The new Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle</strong> provides a framework for amending the Atlas v2 via an Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal. This new Cycle is implemented via Governance Polls that run for three (3) days. An Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposal can only proceed to a vote if it is triggered by a Prime Delegate whose buffer contains at least one month’s worth of budget.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Atlas Edit Monthly</strong> <strong>Cycle</strong> provides a monthly framework for amending the Atlas v2 via an Atlas Edit Proposal. It is implemented via Ratification Polls that run for two (2) weeks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Active Data Updates</strong> enable Facilitators and other ecosystem actors to directly update Atlas documents containing data that must be frequently modified as part of Sky Ecosystem’s routine operational tasks. These documents are called Active Data in Atlas v2. These Active Data Updates are implemented outside of the standard governance cycles. For instance, Active Data Updates enable Governance Facilitators to maintain, in real time, the list of current Aligned Delegates.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To ensure the stability and security of the Sky Ecosystem throughout the Launch transition, the Atlas v2 also has built-in flexibility to ensure any unintended outcomes can be quickly addressed. This is achieved, for instance, through the Facilitators’ Bootstrapping Poll and also the broad discretionary capacities granted to Facilitators. These elements help ensure that the Ecosystem can promptly adapt to emerging challenges.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98719-meet-the-atlas-v2-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98719-meet-the-atlas-v2-3\"></a>Meet the Atlas v2</h1>\n<p>To prepare the Sky community for this critical vote, we are making the Atlas v2 available in two forms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The official version of the Atlas v2 on Github at <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/next-gen-atlas\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - makerdao/next-gen-atlas</a></li>\n<li>A new Atlas Portal at <a href=\"https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The official version on our Github page is optimized for verifiability. It is a static HTML file that will not change during the review and voting period. This is enforced both by Github’s version control system as well as by Sky Governance, which has a <a href=\"https://maroon-peaceful-lemming-588.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreih7mbj4npqhxeprzk7sahpqjrajmxursaenzqgxdw5uo7sz554os4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">hash</a> of the originally uploaded HTML file. This is similar to the controls that exist around the MIP process.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Github, our friends at <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/powerhouse\">@Powerhouse</a> have built an Atlas Portal that makes it easier for community members to explore the contents of the new Atlas. The Atlas Portal has the advantage of allowing you to start at the highest level of the Scopes and drill down, toggle by toggle, into Sections, Primary Documents, and Supporting Documents to learn more about the content you are interested in.</p>\n<p><em>Please note</em>: there will be differences in the Document Identifiers between the official Github repository and the Atlas Portal. The Document IDs in the Github repo use Atlas Axis’ temporary, pared-down document numbering scheme, which allows us to quickly iterate during this early stage of Atlas development. The Doc IDs in the Atlas Portal are algorithmically generated and closer to the Atlas’ formal document identifier rules. The Atlas v2 content in the Github repo and the Portal is exactly the same.</p>\n<p>If you want to reference a particular Atlas Document, you can either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>go to the Atlas Github, perform a search for the provision and grab the permalink next to it; or,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>go to the Atlas Portal, perform a search in <code>Expand All</code> mode, and copy the url that appears when you hover to the left of the provision.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98719-navigating-the-portal-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98719-navigating-the-portal-4\"></a>Navigating the Portal</h2>\n<p>We recommend you start off by going to the top right-hand corner to <code>Collapse all</code> documents. This will show you the highest level structure of the Atlas v2.</p>\n<p>From there, you can delve into one Scope at a time, toggling deeper into the nested structure.<br>\nArticles that have a large number of Sections have been made more reader-friendly via the tool of <code>Categories</code>.

Where the Atlas v2 document does not have a <code>View Provenance</code> link, it is newly-developed logic.</p>\n<p>Our work in developing Atlas v2 has often been about taking currently operational processes not captured in v1 and codifying them into v2. We have been fortunate to work alongside a wide array of stakeholders who have been generous with their time and expertise, including protocol engineers, Facilitators, subject-matter experts and Aligned Delegates. For instance, we did valuable work in this vein around the Core Stability parameters, with the help of BA Labs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98719-specific-changes-from-atlas-v1-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98719-specific-changes-from-atlas-v1-6\"></a>Specific changes from Atlas v1</h1>\n<p>During the Atlas v2 development work, a number of provisions from Atlas v1 were amended, and some were removed. Generally, the impacted logic was either: 1) placeholder logic, 2) early-stage logic for future Sky developments; or 3) obsolete logic.</p>\n<p><strong>Placeholder logic</strong> includes those provisions in Atlas v1 that set out high-level concepts without corresponding details that would allow for operationalization by actors in the Sky Ecosystem. Particularly where those concepts did not relate to mission-critical or currently active functions in the Sky Ecosystem, we have chosen to streamline Atlas v2 to reflect the current state. Examples of placeholder logic that were deferred include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DAO Toolkit</li>\n<li>New Ecosystem-Agreements Infrastructure</li>\n<li>Budgets, Milestones &amp; Results Reporting Standardization</li>\n<li>Star-related provisions (Frontend Standards, Incubation Communication Channels, etc.)</li>\n<li>Facilitator Scope-Assignment Process</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Early-stage logic for future Sky developments</strong> includes Atlas v1 provisions relating to initiatives in the Sky Ecosystem that have not yet launched. We have largely opted to defer these provisions until after the Sky Launch period, at which point we will revisit them in collaboration with our stakeholders. By focusing Atlas v2 on elements and infrastructure that are currently operational, incubating initiatives can adapt to emerging opportunities without being constrained by Atlas logic that was codified too early. Examples of early-stage logic for future Sky developments that were deferred include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NewChain</li>\n<li>FacilitatorDAOs</li>\n<li>Core Artificial Intelligence System</li>\n<li>New Ecosystem-Actor Incubation Infrastructure</li>\n<li>Accessibility Communication Channels Chat Platform</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Obsolete logic</strong> includes provisions in Atlas v1 that relate to legacy, transitional or other logic that is no longer relevant for the Sky Ecosystem, particularly following the Launch. This category reflects deprecated concepts and structures, such as the Core Units and Special Purpose Fund framework. While the Atlas v1 oversaw a transitional period that required management of legacy provisions and budgets, these are no longer needed. (For instance, all Core Unit budgets have fully expired.) Accordingly, we have removed these provisions from the Atlas v2. Examples of obsolete logic that were deferred include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Core Unit MIPs</li>\n<li>Special Purpose Fund MIP</li>\n<li>Alignment Conserver Bootstrapping Focus</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>To the Sky Ecosystem community: we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the Atlas v2. Many exciting things to come.</p>\n<p>Thanks much to all of our collaborators, and here’s to a fruitful Launch! <img src=\"//forum.makerdao.com/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12\" title=\":rocket:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rocket:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n            <p><small>15 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010","pubDate":"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 17:36:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-25010"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-v2-upgrade-poll-request/25010.rss","#text":"Atlas v2 Upgrade - Poll Request"},"filter":false},{"title":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - moreliquid MMMEUR","dc:creator":"joe_moreliquid","category":"Spark Tokenization Grand Prix","description":"<h3><a name=\"p-98713-grand-prix-application-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98713-grand-prix-application-1\"></a>Grand Prix Application</h3>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98713-i-product-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98713-i-product-summary-2\"></a>I.

The other is the desire to fulfill the original purpose of Dai, by delivering utility and value to real people at scale.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately these two worlds are fundamentally in friction with each other, as noted by the Stablecoin Trilemma, which states that achieving a dollar peg, maintaining pure decentralization, and scaling to large sizes simultaneously is not feasible.</p>\n<p>There are two main options for solving the Stablecoin Trilemma:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Prioritize Utility and Scale by choosing dollar peg + real world asset collateral, which requires integration with traditional finance (TradFi) and alignment with real world entities. Because utility and scalability are so fundamental for growth, it is almost impossible to find a major DeFi project that hasn’t made this tradeoff, or relies on stablecoins that have made this tradeoff. Decentralization is important everywhere it offers the best path towards practical resilience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take the path of pure decentralization and demand complete independence from centralized control and strict reliance on decentralized collateral. While conventional wisdom says that it is a lot harder to achieve significant growth when optimizing for decentralization above all else, the Sky/Maker community has always believed that there is potential in this approach, and that a natural legitimate userbase exists for this kind of stablecoin.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sky will execute simultaneously on both of these visions, without compromise, by doing them separately.</p>\n<p>Eventually, most Dai use cases will be succeeded by USDS, which will focus on mass market adoption and regulatorily compliant Real-World Asset (RWA) backing, with decentralization used as a powerful tool to ensure transparency, resilience, and checks and balances.</p>\n<p>To complement USDS, a second, purely decentralized stablecoin, codenamed PureDai, will also be made available as an option for users who prefer the vision of pure decentralization.</p>\n<p>Holders of Dai will eventually be able to upgrade to either of these options. The upgrade from Dai to USDS will begin in the short term, while the option to upgrade from Dai to PureDai will follow at a later date. Dai will continue to function as today, and if in doubt Dai users can simply keep holding their Dai for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98658-usds-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98658-usds-2\"></a>USDS</h1>\n<p>USDS is the main successor to Dai - focused on the goal of adoption, scale and resilience. It also adds a powerful focus on multiple different types of rewards, including Sky Savings Rate and Sky Token Rewards, available for eligible users (Access to Rewards through Sky.money are restricted in some jurisdictions, such as the US).</p>\n<p>This is a continuation of the trajectory Dai has taken and USDS will have all of its features tailored towards this goal. USDS will be a decentralized stablecoin that uses decentralization as a means to achieve practical ends, by making its governance and infrastructure as resilient and transparent as possible.</p>\n<p>USDS will take over the RWA- and tradfi integrations of Dai, deepening and improving them, and making them more resilient over time through its resilient and decentralized governance processes and transparent infrastructure, based on the Atlas.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98658-future-freeze-function-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98658-future-freeze-function-3\"></a>Future freeze function</h3>\n<p>To ensure USDS can safely reach global scale, it will eventually be upgraded to have a freeze function similar to the industry standard of other major RWA-backed stablecoins. The freeze function will not be implemented in USDS at launch, but the token will have upgradeability so that it can later be implemented by decentralized governance vote.</p>\n<p>Dai will remain as it is today with no possibility of adding a freeze function due to the technical immutability of its ERC-20 implementation.</p>\n<p>The future freeze function is generally expected to follow rule of law from jurisdictions where Sky needs a high level of certainty that the legal system will enforce recourse against RWA collateral. This will result in a much greater level of security, stability and reliability of using large scale RWA collateral for USDS as it scales to global mass market adoption.</p>\n<p>The timeline for when the freeze function is implemented will likely be many months or even years, depending on the growth trajectory of USDS. The future freeze function will be implemented in a way that leverages the decentralized governance and transparent processes of the Sky Atlas, to ensure it will be a risk-minimized process with checks and balances. This could include unique features such as a decentralized appeals process that would ensure all potentially controversial cases of a freeze being done are processed in public, in a fully transparent way.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98658-dai-after-usds-launch-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98658-dai-after-usds-launch-4\"></a>Dai after USDS Launch</h1>\n<p>Dai users will be able to upgrade to USDS during Launch Season as planned, however they can also choose to stay with Dai. Dai will remain as it is today with no possibility of adding a freeze function due to the technical immutability of its ERC-20 implementation.</p>\n<p>Dai will remain pegged to USD and will be upgradeable to USDS any time the user wishes. It will also be possible to instantly reverse the process and convert any amount of USDS to Dai. Dai will be used as a liquidity and integrations backend for USDS, as USDS apps and frontends can leverage the instant 1:1 Dai/USDS conversion to provide better UX.</p>\n<p>After an initial transition period (the current estimate is at least 1 year), DSR will begin to be phased out by gradually ramping the rate down over time. Eventually, rewards will only be available for eligible users on USDS.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98658-puredai-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98658-puredai-5\"></a>PureDai</h1>\n<p>Dai users in the future will have the option of upgrading their Dai to PureDai (temporary codename), which is a return to the ideological roots of Dai. PureDai will feature only purely decentralized collateral such as ETH and stETH, free-floating peg like Rai, maximally decentralized oracles and no governance or budgets.</p>\n<p>It is possible that PureDai will be designed to initially attempt to maintain a 1:1 USD peg for as long as possible, but without RWA collateral it is not possible to guarantee such a peg will hold long term.</p>\n<p>PureDai will be available after a few years, and will be released in its final, immutable form. From the moment it is released it will require no further upgrades or changes, and will be completely independent from Sky. The launch of PureDai will have similarities with the launch of the Initial Stars (formerly known as SubDAOs), and will leverage tools and experience to help make it as successful as possible, but PureDai will be fundamentally different from a Stars as it will have no permanent connection to Maker once launched.</p>\n<p>Once PureDai is released, Dai users will be able to easily upgrade to it from the Sky frontends. PureDai will be deployed only on Ethereum mainnet, but L2’s and bridges may choose to support transporting it to other blockchains.</p>\n<p>PureDai will feature a new brand that is optimized for communicating the specific, unique value proposition of PureDai. Until the rebrand is unveiled in advance of the launch of the finished PureDai system, PureDai is used as a temporary placeholder name.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98658-what-happens-to-dai-in-the-long-term-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98658-what-happens-to-dai-in-the-long-term-6\"></a>What happens to Dai in the long term?</h1>\n<p>After the launch of PureDai, Dai users will have two complementary choices available to them: They can upgrade to USDS and take advantage of its USD peg, reward features and legal resilience, or they can upgrade to PureDai to gain the advantages of its purely decentralized collateral.</p>\n<p>Eventually, after many years, it is expected that Dai will gradually deprecate as all users and integrations migrate to either USDS or PureDai. The timeline for when this happens will depend on how quickly the ecosystem adopts USDS and PureDai.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98658-the-two-best-points-in-the-space-of-tradeoffs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98658-the-two-best-points-in-the-space-of-tradeoffs-7\"></a>The two best points in the space of tradeoffs</h1>\n<p>With USDS and PureDai, current Dai holders will have the optimal choices available to them.

Wondering how it could benefit DAOs, was inevitable with the many challenges that arise while coordinating in such an open organization. But is governance something that we are willing to hand over to AI? If yes, will we be taking any precautions, especially since the decision-making of our financial instruments is dependent? But isn’t that the promise? The integration of AI into DAOs revolutionized how we approach collective decision-making, resource allocation, and community management. But with technologies in their nascent stages, do we want to accelerate it? MakerDAO’s job application got me thinking and reading more about Atlas Axis. Let’s do a short dive into where we are!?</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98644-the-genesis-of-decentralized-governance-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-the-genesis-of-decentralized-governance-1\"></a>The Genesis of Decentralized Governance</h1>\n<p>To appreciate the impact of AI on DAO governance, we must first try to understand the historical context that gave rise to these revolutionary systems. The concept of decentralization has been centuries old even practised in many instances of history, but let’s not go deep into that for now. Modern-day decentralized governance emerged alongside the birth of Bitcoin in 2009. Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation introduced the world to a novel consensus mechanism, where network participants collectively maintained and secured a distributed ledger without central authority. It enabled the technology required to carry it out in the digital era.</p>\n<p>As blockchain technology matured, projects like Ethereum expanded on this foundation, introducing smart contracts that could automate complex interactions between parties. This paved the way for DAOs; now organizations had an option to be governed by code rather than traditional hierarchical structures. The DAO, launched in 2016, marked a significant milestone in this journey despite its unfortunate fate due to a critical vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The DAO ecosystem has flourished, with numerous organizations emerging to tackle various challenges and explore different governance models. Aragon, for instance, pioneered tools for creating and managing DAOs, making it easier for anyone to launch a decentralized organization. Moloch DAO introduced the concept of “rage quitting,” allowing members to exit with their share of assets if they disagree with a decision. GitcoinDAO has been instrumental in supporting public goods funding through quadratic funding mechanisms. They also have constantly experimented with multiple governance processes and collaborated with multiple DAOs like TEC at the same time.</p>\n<p>In the DeFi space, Aave and Compound have shown how protocol governance can be effectively decentralized, with token holders making key decisions about protocol parameters and upgrades. MakerDAO, as mentioned earlier, demonstrated the power of DAOs in managing complex financial systems. The Near Protocol introduced a unique model of sharded blockchain governance, allowing for more scalable decision-making.</p>\n<p>Social and cultural DAOs like Friends with Benefits (FWB) and Bankless DAO have explored how decentralized governance can be applied to community building and media production. IndexCoop showed how DAOs could be used to create and manage decentralized index products, while Rarible DAO governs a decentralized NFT marketplace.</p>\n<p>These diverse examples have provided valuable lessons for the DAO ecosystem:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The importance of aligning incentives between token holders and users of the protocol or platform.</li>\n<li>The need for flexible governance structures that can evolve as the organization grows.</li>\n<li>The challenge of balancing decentralization with efficient decision-making, especially as DAOs scale.</li>\n<li>The power of community-driven innovation and the potential for DAOs to solve complex coordination problems.</li>\n<li>The importance of robust security measures and careful smart contract design to prevent vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Earlier DAOs faced numerous challenges, including low participation rates, inefficient decision-making processes, difficulty achieving consensus on complex issues, etc. These hurdles highlighted the need for more sophisticated governance and operational models that could balance decentralization with efficiency and scalability.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98644-the-present-landscape-daos-stablecoins-and-emerging-ai-applications-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-the-present-landscape-daos-stablecoins-and-emerging-ai-applications-2\"></a>The Present Landscape: DAOs, Stablecoins, and Emerging AI Applications</h1>\n<p>Today, the DAO ecosystem is thriving, with organizations like MakerDAO leading in decentralized finance (DeFi). MakerDAO, the creator of the DAI stablecoin, demonstrates how DAOs can manage complex financial systems through distributed governance. The introduction of stablecoins like DAI has been a game-changer for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing a bridge between volatile crypto assets and the stability needed for everyday financial transactions.</p>\n<p>Stablecoins have become integral to DAO governance in several ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>They provide a stable unit of account for treasury management and project funding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They enable more predictable voting mechanisms, as token values remain consistent over time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They facilitate easier onboarding of new participants who may be hesitant to deal with volatile cryptocurrencies.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Concurrently, AI applications in blockchain are beginning to emerge. Machine learning algorithms are being employed for predictive analytics in trading, fraud detection, and network optimization. However, AI in governance processes is still in its infancy, presenting exciting opportunities and significant challenges.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98644-makerdaos-endgame-and-atlas-axis-a-vision-for-the-future-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-makerdaos-endgame-and-atlas-axis-a-vision-for-the-future-3\"></a>MakerDAO’s Endgame and Atlas Axis: A Vision for the Future</h1>\n<p>MakerDAO’s Endgame project represents a bold step towards reimagining DAO governance for the future. At its core, Endgame aims to create a more resilient, decentralized, and unbiased world currency system. The Atlas, an AI-enhanced governance ruleset, will be the centrepiece of this transformation.</p>\n<p>The Atlas Axis initiative, incubated by MakerDAO, is tasked with developing this next-generation governance system. By leveraging AI, Atlas Axis aims to create a governance framework that is efficient and accessible to a broader range of participants.</p>\n<p>Key components of the Atlas system include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Adaptive System Dataset: A comprehensive repository of all data relevant to MakerDAO governance, including rules, processes, historical data, and precedents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Governance AI Tools (GAITs): AI-powered assistants that help participants navigate the complex governance landscape, automating routine tasks and providing decision support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Knowledge Grounding: Ensuring that information in the Atlas has sufficient context to prevent misinterpretation, even in adversarial scenarios.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multi-lingual Support: AI-powered translation tools to make governance accessible across language barriers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SubDAO Integration: Extending the Atlas framework to smaller, specialized DAOs within the MakerDAO ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98644-the-role-of-ai-in-enhancing-decentralized-governance-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-the-role-of-ai-in-enhancing-decentralized-governance-4\"></a>The Role of AI in Enhancing Decentralized Governance</h1>\n<p>As we look to the future, AI has the potential to address many of the challenges facing current DAO governance models:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improving Participation and Engagement:<br>\nAI-powered interfaces can simplify complex governance processes, making it easier for non-experts to participate meaningfully. For example, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms could summarize lengthy proposals, highlighting key points and potential impacts.</li>\n<li>Enhancing Decision Quality:<br>\nMachine learning models trained on historical governance data could provide decision support, offering insights into the potential outcomes of various proposals. It could help participants make more informed choices, especially on technical or highly specialized issues.</li>\n<li>Streamlining Operations:<br>\nAutomated systems could handle routine governance tasks, such as proposal formatting, stakeholder notifications, and vote tallying, freeing human participants to focus on higher-level strategic decisions.</li>\n<li>Predictive Analytics:<br>\nAI models could analyze on-chain and off-chain data to forecast governance trends, helping DAOs anticipate and prepare for potential challenges or opportunities.</li>\n<li>Fraud Detection and Security:<br>\nMachine learning algorithms could monitor governance activities for unusual patterns, helping to identify and prevent malicious actions such as governance attacks or token manipulation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98644-balancing-decentralization-and-efficiency-in-large-scale-daos-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-balancing-decentralization-and-efficiency-in-large-scale-daos-5\"></a>Balancing decentralization and efficiency in large-scale DAOs</h1>\n<p>The integration of AI into DAO governance is a delicate balancing act between enhancing efficiency and maintaining the core ethos of decentralization. On one hand, AI tools can significantly improve the speed and quality of decision-making processes. On the other hand, over-reliance on AI systems could potentially centralize power in the hands of those who control these tools.</p>\n<p>To navigate this challenge, DAOs like MakerDAO are exploring multi-layered governance models. The Atlas system, for instance, aims to create a framework where AI tools assist and empower human decision-makers rather than replace them. This approach seeks to combine the efficiency of AI with the wisdom and adaptability of human governance.</p>\n<p>Key considerations in this balancing act include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Transparency and Auditability: Ensuring that AI decision support systems are open-source and their decision-making processes are transparent and auditable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Decentralized AI Development: Encouraging community-driven development and improvement of governance AI tools to prevent centralization of power.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Human Oversight: Maintaining clear mechanisms for human participants to override or modify AI-generated recommendations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Diversity and Inclusivity: Designing AI systems that account for diverse perspectives and ensure equitable participation across stakeholder groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scalability: Developing governance models that efficiently handle increased complexity and participant numbers as DAOs grow.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98644-the-impact-of-stablecoins-on-dao-governance-and-the-broader-crypto-ecosystem-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-the-impact-of-stablecoins-on-dao-governance-and-the-broader-crypto-ecosystem-6\"></a>The Impact of Stablecoins on DAO Governance and the Broader Crypto Ecosystem</h1>\n<p>Stablecoins have become a crucial component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly in the context of DAO governance. Their impact extends far beyond providing a stable medium of exchange:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Governance Participation Incentives: Stablecoins can create more predictable and attractive incentive structures for governance participation. For instance, staking stablecoins for voting rights or earning stablecoin rewards for active participation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Treasury Management: Stablecoins allow DAOs to manage their treasuries more effectively, hedging against the volatility of other crypto assets and ensuring consistent funding for long-term projects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cross-Chain Governance: As stablecoins become increasingly interoperable across different blockchain networks, they could facilitate governance actions that span multiple ecosystems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real-World Integration: Stablecoins bridge the gap between the crypto world and traditional finance, allowing DAOs to interact more seamlessly with real-world entities and financial systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Risk Management: In the context of DeFi protocols governed by DAOs, stablecoins provide a crucial tool for managing systemic risk and ensuring protocol solvency.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98644-future-scenarios-the-convergence-of-ai-stablecoins-and-dao-governance-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-future-scenarios-the-convergence-of-ai-stablecoins-and-dao-governance-7\"></a>Future Scenarios: The Convergence of AI, Stablecoins, and DAO Governance</h1>\n<p>As we peek into the future, several potential scenarios emerge for the evolution of DAO governance:</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98644-optimistic-scenario-ai-enhanced-highly-efficient-daos-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-optimistic-scenario-ai-enhanced-highly-efficient-daos-8\"></a>Optimistic Scenario: AI-Enhanced, Highly Efficient DAOs</h2>\n<p>In the future, AI tools will seamlessly integrate into DAO governance, dramatically improving efficiency and participation rates. Natural language interfaces allow anyone to engage with governance processes in their native language. AI-powered analytics provide real-time insights into the potential impacts of governance decisions, leading to more informed voting. Stablecoins facilitate frictionless value transfer within and between DAOs, enabling complex, multi-stakeholder decisions to be executed swiftly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98644-pessimistic-scenario-ai-centralization-and-loss-of-human-agency-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-pessimistic-scenario-ai-centralization-and-loss-of-human-agency-9\"></a>Pessimistic Scenario: AI Centralization and Loss of Human Agency</h2>\n<p>In a less optimistic future, over-reliance on AI leads to a form of soft centralization. Complex AI systems become black boxes, understood only by a small elite. While governance appears decentralized on the surface, AI systems effectively make important decisions, reducing human participants to rubber-stamping AI-generated proposals. The nuanced understanding of human values and ethics is lost while chasing algorithmic efficiency.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98644-balanced-perspective-a-hybrid-model-of-human-ai-governance-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-balanced-perspective-a-hybrid-model-of-human-ai-governance-10\"></a>Balanced Perspective: A Hybrid Model of Human-AI Governance</h2>\n<p>A more realistic future likely lies somewhere between these extremes. AI might become a powerful tool in the DAO governance toolkit, but we maintain clear boundaries for a human agency to interact or override critical decisions. Governance processes evolve to leverage AI for information gathering, scenario modelling, and routine operations while preserving human judgment for high-level strategy and value-aligned decision-making. Stablecoins should continue to play a crucial role in incentivizing participation and managing DAO resources. However, improved mechanisms are required to prevent manipulation and ensure true decentralization.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98644-ethical-and-societal-implications-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-ethical-and-societal-implications-11\"></a>Ethical and societal implications</h1>\n<p>The integration of AI into DAO governance raises profound ethical questions that extend beyond the realm of technology:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Algorithmic Bias: How can we ensure that AI governance tools don’t perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Governance Participation Gap: Will AI-enhanced governance widen the gap between tech-savvy participants and others, or can it be a great equalizer?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accountability: How do we establish clear lines of accountability in a system where AI influences decisions?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Privacy and Data Rights: As AI systems process vast amounts of governance-related data, how do we protect individual privacy and data rights?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Global Impact: As DAOs and their governance models improve, how might they influence traditional governance structures and global power dynamics?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98644-conclusion-the-path-forward-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98644-conclusion-the-path-forward-12\"></a>Conclusion: The Path Forward</h1>\n<p>Projects like MakerDAO’s Endgame and Atlas Axis are at the forefront of this revolution, pioneering new models of decentralized governance that leverage cutting-edge technology while striving to uphold the core values of decentralization and community empowerment.</p>\n<p>As we navigate this uncharted territory, we must approach these developments with a balance of enthusiasm and caution. The promise of more efficient, inclusive, and responsive governance systems is immense, but so are the challenges and potential pitfalls.</p>\n<p>Key areas for future research and development include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Developing robust frameworks for evaluating the performance and impact of AI in governance systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Creating standards for the ethical development and deployment of governance AI tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exploring new models of human-AI collaboration in decision-making processes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Investigating the long-term economic and social impacts of stablecoin-based governance incentives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Designing governance systems that adapt to rapid technological change while maintaining stability and user trust.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The journey toward effective, decentralized, and AI-enhanced governance systems is just the beginning. It will require the collective effort of technologists, economists, ethicists, and governance experts to realize the full potential of these technologies while mitigating their risks.

Product Information</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Describe the product:</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Investment Strategy</strong></em><br>\nUSTB offers Qualified Purchasers access to short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills. USTB’s investment objective is to seek current income as is consistent with liquidity and stability of principal, targeting returns in line with the federal funds rate.</p>\n<p>The Fund is sub-advised by <a href=\"https://www.federatedhermes.com/us/campaigns/site.do\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Federated Hermes</a>, an ~$800B AUM asset manager. The majority of the assets they manage are deployed in Money Market strategies. <a href=\"https://www.federatedhermes.com/us/about/people/susan-hill.do\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Susan Hill, CFA</a> is the Portfolio Manager responsible for executing the Fund’s mandate. She brings decades of investing experience managing assets for institutions and is specifically responsible for overseeing ~$300B in fixed-income assets.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Legal Structure</strong></em><br>\nUSTB is a separate series of Superstate Asset Trust (a Delaware Statutory Trust). USTB is a private fund pursuant to Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. USTB is only available to a limited subset of potential investors that meet the criteria outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum. Investors must undergo AML, KYC, and sanctions compliance checks.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fund Mechanics</strong></em><br>\nInvestors may purchase Shares of USTB via USDC or USD (“cash”) which may be issued in the form of ERC-20 tokens. This tokenized ownership is composable and transferable where one Share is represented by one USTB token on Ethereum. Transferring the USTB token effectively transfers ownership of the underlying share of the Fund. Investors who complete onboarding may identify Ethereum addresses to an AllowList, a smart contract managed by Superstate Inc. that approves KYC’d entities to interact with USTB tokens.</p>\n<p>Daily NAV/S (also available <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x289B5036cd942e619E1Ee48670F98d214E745AAC\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">onchain via Chainlink</a>), transparent holdings, yield, and more are available via the Investor Portal or by visiting: <a href=\"https://superstate.co/ustb\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Superstate - USTB Fund</a></p>\n<p><em><strong>Service Providers Overview</strong></em><br>\nUSTB’s U.S. Treasury Bills are held in custody in a segregated custodial account at an OCC-charted financial institution, <a href=\"https://www.umb.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UMB Bank</a> in the name of USTB.</p>\n<p>USTB is audited annually by Ernst &amp; Young LLP (“EY”), ensuring the accuracy of accounting for investors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navconsulting.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">NAV Fund Services</a> calculates the Fund’s NAV/S daily based on holdings and activity, providing rapid data delivery to Superstate through their API.

Describe the underlying asset:</strong></p>\n<p>USTB’s investment mandate ensures at least 95% of the portfolio is invested in short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills. Up to 5% of the portfolio at any time can be held in cash to facilitate liquidity; however, given the highly liquid nature of the portfolio, cash positions are kept at a minimum at all times. Additionally, USTB’s mandate is to maintain an average portfolio duration of one year or less.</p>\n<p>See below for a table of current holdings sorted by Maturity Date (also on the <a href=\"https://superstate.co/ustb#holdings\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USTB page here</a>).

How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</strong></p>\n<p>USTB shares may be issued as a yield-bearing ERC-20 token, USTB token, or as Book Entry shares. Each USTB token is one share in USTB, and the number of shares issued (USTB tokens minted) is equal to the Purchase Amount ($) divided by the Net Asset Value per share (NAV/S) on a given Market Day. Market Days are when both the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are open.</p>\n<p>USTB token has 6 decimal places, with 1.000000 (1e6 on Ethereum) representing one unit of USTB. The NAV/S started at $10 and increases daily due to the Fund’s investments accruing interest. NAV/S is calculated by a reputable third party, NAV Fund Services, by dividing the total Assets Under Management (AUM) by the total number of shares in the Fund. This calculation occurs once per market day and reflects the price per share of USTB based on its underlying asset prices.</p>\n<p>Investors redeeming USTB may elect to receive USDC or USD equivalent to the number of shares/tokens times the NAV/S on a given Market Day. USTB functions similarly to Lido’s wstETH, where your token balance remains static unless you mint, burn, or transfer. The NAV/S increases over time, allowing investors to redeem a share of USTB for an increasing amount of U.S. Dollars or USDC.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the yield and token mechanics, <a href=\"https://docs.superstate.co/ustb/income-fees-and-yield\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

In the ELA, Superstate Inc. has agreed to waive or pay for certain expenses on behalf of the Fund. Superstate Inc. (not shareholders) shall continue to be responsible for paying new and/or ongoing expenses related to:</p>\n<p>(a) the offering and organization of the Trust and the Series,<br>\n(b) Sub-Advisor fees<br>\n(c) insurance costs and expenses (e.g., for the assets of the Fund, D&amp;O, E&amp;O),<br>\n(d) expenses in connection with tokenization of the Shares.</p>\n<p><strong>10.

How is your product permissioned? (e.g., primary users, secondary users)</strong></p>\n<p>Qualified purchasers seeking to invest must first complete a standard KYC/AML onboarding process administered by a proprietary Investor Portal developed by Superstate Inc. Upon successful onboarding, investors’ Ethereum addresses are added to an AllowList smart contract. The AllowList ensures that only approved addresses can mint, transfer, or receive USTB. This AllowList is administered by a Fireblocks MPC, requiring m of n signatures to add or remove addresses. View the onchain AllowList contract <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x42d75C8FdBBF046DF0Fe1Ff388DA16fF99dE8149\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here.<br>\n</a><br>\nUSTB is freely transferable between shareholders’ Ethereum addresses on the AllowList using transfer or transferFrom functions. Each function checks that the sender and receiver are both on the AllowList and authorized for that specific token. If either address is not on the AllowList, the transaction will fail. In addition to facilitating peer-to-peer secondary market transactions from wallet to wallet, future DeFi integrations will facilitate lending and borrowing or swaps subject to AllowList constraints and enable more onchain USTB utility.</p>\n<p><strong>12. What is the monthly transaction volume for the product?</strong></p>\n<p>The 30-day transaction volume is $84,196,878.83 as of 7/31/2024. This was across 12 transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>13. What is the expected and maximum time for users to subscribe to and redeem from your product? Have you had any interruptions in your ability to process redemptions and subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary Liquidity</strong><br>\nUSTB offers daily liquidity each Market Day and we process purchases/redemptions at 9:00 AM ET. Market Days are when both the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are open.</p>\n<p><strong>Purchases</strong><br>\nInvestors can purchase USTB by either transferring USDC to a client-specific USTB Purchase Address (which is a Circle deposit address) or by initiating a bank wire to USTB’s custodian with a unique memo attributing the purchase to the investor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If funds are received before 9:00 AM ET on a Market Day, the investor will receive USTB at the prior Market Day’s closing NAV/Share, minted shortly after 9:00 AM ET.</li>\n<li>If funds are received after 9:00 AM ET, the investor will receive USTB at the next available NAV/Share, shortly after 9:00 AM ET on the next Market Day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Purchases are viewable in the Investor Portal, and you will receive confirmation emails when a purchase has been initiated and completed. Gas fees to transfer USDC or bank fees to wire U.S. Dollars for purchases are the responsibility of the investor.</p>\n<p><strong>Redemptions</strong><br>\nInvestors can redeem from USTB by either transferring USTB to the token contract or by calling the <code>burn()</code> function on the token.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a redemption request is received before 9:00 AM ET on a Market Day, tokens/shares will be redeemed at that Market Day’s closing NAV/Share. The investor will receive USDC or USD on the same day (T+0).\n<ul>\n<li>For redemptions before the cutoff time (9:00 AM ET), we instruct Federated Hermes, USTB’s sub-advisor, at 9:00 AM ET to sell securities, aiming to settle by 1:00 PM ET.</li>\n<li>This allows UMB Bank to wire USD back to Circle, returning USDC to Spark the same day (T+0).</li>\n<li>We anticipate this will occur the majority of the time, given the assets in the Fund.</li>\n<li>If U.S. Treasury Bills don’t settle before the wire cut-off, USDC will be returned the following Market Day.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If a redemption request is received after 9:00 AM ET on a Market Day, tokens/shares will be redeemed at the next Market Day’s closing NAV/Share.

Gas fees to transfer USTB to the token contract address are the responsibility of the investor.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s PPM and Investment Agreement allow up to T+2 for redemptions as a conservative buffer. However, since inception, over $150M in gross redemptions have been processed, with each one settled to clients either within T+0 or T+1 with no interruptions in our ability to process redemptions.</p>\n<p><strong>14. Provide a description of the subscription and redemption process. Include a diagram of the flow of funds, including each party involved.</strong></p>\n<p>As a convenience to shareholders, purchases and redemptions may be made with USDC or fiat (USD), resulting in two unique, but similar, flows of funds.</p>\n<p>All subsequent responses will focus solely on USDC, as the Sky Ecosystem does not intend to engage with fiat rails.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98628-usdc-flow-of-funds-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98628-usdc-flow-of-funds-4\"></a>USDC Flow of Funds</h4>\n<p><em><strong>AllowList</strong></em><br>\nSpark will undergo Superstate’s KYC/AML onboarding process and once approved may add Ethereum addresses to the AllowList, identifying one address as the Primary AllowList Address where all USTB tokens will be minted. AllowList addresses can be changed at any time via the Superstate Investor Portal.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Purchases</strong></em><br>\nTo initiate a purchase of USTB, Spark will transfer USDC to their USTB Purchase Address, which is a unique Circle deposit address provided after successful onboarding and available in the Superstate Investor Portal at all times.</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of USDC, Circle Financial converts USDC to USD (“cash”) and sends it to the Custodian, UMB Bank. Once the cash has settled, Federated Hermes is instructed to deploy capital per the mandate.</p>\n<p>Tokens are minted shortly after 9:00 AM ET every day, so depending on when purchases are made it will either be T+0 or T+1. Each token is a 1:1 representation of the number of shares resulting from a purchase.</p>\n<p>The quantity of shares issued/tokens minted is calculated by dividing the dollar value of USDC (or cash) by the Market Day’s NAV. Superstate pays gas fees for minting USTB tokens to Spark’s Primary AllowList Address.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Redemptions</strong></em><br>\nRedemptions can be initiated one of two ways: 1) call the token’s <code>burn()</code> function or 2) transfer the tokens to the USTB Contract Address: 0x43415eB6ff9DB7E26A15b704e7A3eDCe97d31C4e. Instructions for redeeming shares from the USTB are available in the Superstate Investor Portal at all times.</p>\n<p>Upon the receipt of a redemption request, Superstate Inc. instructs Federated Hermes to sell U.S. Treasury Bills. The proceeds of this sale are settled in cash at UMB Bank, which then wires to Circle. Circle mints the corresponding amount of USDC and automatically sends it back to the USDC Proceeds Address designated and controlled by the DAO. The USDC Proceeds Address can be updated in the Investor Portal at any time.</p>\n<p>Gas fees to burn or transfer USTB are paid by Spark.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/3/b3f5696c4b8cd770550ba6569891255281f5a01d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pFZg5QvZZDKfNNZQWR5BOqeTbkN.png?dl=1\" title=\"|625.0666666666666x391\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/3/b3f5696c4b8cd770550ba6569891255281f5a01d_2_690x431.png\" alt=\"|625.0666666666666x391\" data-base62-sha1=\"pFZg5QvZZDKfNNZQWR5BOqeTbkN\" width=\"690\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/3/b3f5696c4b8cd770550ba6569891255281f5a01d_2_690x431.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/3/b3f5696c4b8cd770550ba6569891255281f5a01d_2_1035x646.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/3/b3f5696c4b8cd770550ba6569891255281f5a01d_2_1380x862.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDF0EF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>15. Have any liquidity vehicles been established to enhance redemption and subscription efficiency?

Legal Structure</h2>\n<p><strong>1.  Explain the legal structure of the product and the jurisdictions in which it operates</strong><br>\nUSTB is a private fund pursuant to Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. USTB is organized as a Series in a Delaware Statutory Trust (DSTA) and is available to qualified purchasers who meet the criteria outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum. Potential investors must undergo AML, KYC, and sanctions compliance review. The Fund is currently available to Qualified Purchasers in the United States, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and Bermuda as well as jurisdictions that permit reverse inquiry by qualifying investors. Superstate continues to expand access to the USTB in additional jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>Superstate Inc. is a Delaware corporation. Superstate Inc. is currently an Exempt Reporting Adviser (“ERA”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in reliance on the private fund adviser exemption under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Information about Superstate Inc. can be found by visiting the SEC website <a href=\"http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">www.adviserinfo.sec.gov</a> and searching for our firm name.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What regulatory bodies oversee the product?</strong></p>\n<p>USTB is exempt from SEC registration by operating consistent with Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act and is only available to qualified purchasers who meet certain criteria as outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum. USTB is offered pursuant to 506(c) exemption of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 and has filed Form D available <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2004367/000200436724000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here.</a></p>\n<p>Superstate Inc. as an ERA is subject to inspection and examination by the SEC.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, registrations, concessions, approvals, and exemptions does your product or company hold?</strong></p>\n<p>USTB is exempt from registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a private fund per Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act and is only available to qualified purchasers who meet certain criteria as outlined in the Private Placement Memorandum. The Fund is offered pursuant to 506(c) exemption of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 and has filed Form D available <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2004367/000200436724000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here.</a></p>\n<p>USTB is designated by the Bermudian Monetary Authority (“BMA”) as an Overseas fund pursuant to Section 5A of the Investment Funds Act 2006.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is bankruptcy remoteness established for assets of this product? Does the issuer have more than one product? Please provide separately any related legal opinions or supplementary documents regarding bankruptcy remoteness.</strong></p>\n<p>USTB is bankruptcy-remote from Superstate Inc. and is organized as a separate Series of Superstate Asset Trust, a Delaware Statutory Trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (“DSTA”).</p>\n<p>Superstate Asset Trust structure affords each Superstate Fund (USTB and USCC) with limitation on inter-series liability. Each Superstate Fund is established as an independent and separate Series from each other that is bankruptcy remote. This structure ensures that shareholders’ investments are both separate from Superstate Inc.'s balance sheet and are siloed from each other.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What rights do token holders have?</strong><br>\nInvestors in USTB are the owners of USTB and are granted shareholder rights as detailed in the Fund’s offering materials (shared with <a href=\"mailto:GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial\">GrandPrix@steakhouse.financial</a> over email on 08/28/2024). Each shareholder benefits from the inter-series limitation of liability provided by the DSTA, meaning they are siloed from liabilities arising from other series issued by Superstate Asset Trust.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Are there any pending or threatened legal proceedings or investigations against the company or any of its officers?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Describe any conflicts of interest the company or product may have with its officers or Sky</strong></p>\n<p>USTB’s Investment Manager is a fiduciary to USTB and therefore is required to act in its best interests.</p>\n<p>Steakhouse Financial is a member of the <a href=\"https://superstate.co/blog/superstate-industry-council-welcomes-second-cohort\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Superstate Industry Council</a>, collaborating with Superstate and other members to help increase the adoption of tokenized assets across the ecosystem. Their participation in the SIC is non-compensatory and they provide objective feedback to help the entire space grow, not just Superstate’s products/roadmap.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Explain the potential tax implications associated with the product</strong><br>\nOn Market Days, NAV Fund Services will provide the NAV per share, reflecting the valuation of the securities in the portfolio, net of expenses, on a per-share basis. When investors purchase or redeem USTB, the transaction is recorded at the applicable NAV per share for that Market Day.</p>\n<p>Any gain realized between the redemption proceeds and the original purchase amount is subject to taxation at the investor’s applicable tax rate.</p>\n<p>USTB does not distribute dividends or make other distributions, so the primary tax consequence arises from the gain or loss realized on redemption. No taxes are withheld on any transactions within the Fund.</p>\n<p>USTB intends to operate in a manner that allows it to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, USTB is not expected to be subject to federal income tax liability and investors are responsible for fulfilling their tax obligations and are advised to consult with a tax advisor. NAV Fund Services will prepare a Schedule K-1 annually for each investor, detailing their share of the Fund’s gains or losses for the year. Foreign investors will also receive a Form 1042-S reflecting that none of the Fund’s income is considered ECI.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98628-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98628-v-performance-reporting-and-technical-6\"></a>V.

Describe the frequency, content, and process for performance and portfolio transparency reports. Who provides these?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Account Information</strong><br>\nInvestors receive monthly statements prepared by USTB’s NAV Calculation Agent, NAV Fund Services (see example below). In addition, the Investor Portal gives investors transparency into their current balances, historical transactions, fund details, and securities holdings.</p>\n<p>For transparency, members of the Spark Star can share the monthly statements on the public forum. Also, multiple users can be added to the Investor Portal with either Admin or Team (read-only) privileges to get real-time access to all information available related to Spark’s position and underlying exposures.</p>\n<p><strong>Fund Information</strong><br>\nMore helpful fund statistics such as daily NAV/S, AUM, performance, and weekly holdings are publicly available at the following link, which the Sky community can easily access at any time: <a href=\"http://superstate.co/ustb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">superstate.co/ustb</a>. We also provide USTB’s unaudited financials through the Investor Portal.</p>\n<p>We have partnered with Chainlink to bring our <a href=\"https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/ustb-nav\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">NAV/S API onchain</a> and it can easily integrate with tools developed by Powerhouse (such as Connect and the RWA Reporting Tool for BA Labs). Superstate is also working with Chainlink to provide real-time visibility into underlying assets via Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves oracle. This ensures that DAI (or USDS) holders and Sky can always view the collateral backing the stablecoin through USTB, providing real-time transparency to facilitate stability.</p>\n<p>Example Account Statement produced by NAV Fund Services for Spark.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/f/2fe4de30bf0654925417a77a1207fa7de2526e27.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6PGMSA06Y5BrDlaJm6mQ1pAY3LV.png?dl=1\" title=\"|356.2110484671038x462\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/2/f/2fe4de30bf0654925417a77a1207fa7de2526e27_2_617x800.png\" alt=\"|356.2110484671038x462\" data-base62-sha1=\"6PGMSA06Y5BrDlaJm6mQ1pAY3LV\" width=\"617\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/2/f/2fe4de30bf0654925417a77a1207fa7de2526e27_2_617x800.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/f/2fe4de30bf0654925417a77a1207fa7de2526e27.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/f/2fe4de30bf0654925417a77a1207fa7de2526e27.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F2F3F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the accounting and auditing processes for the portfolio and product</strong></p>\n<p>NAV Fund Services performs daily accounting for USTB, valuing the securities in the portfolio and calculating the NAV per share. Each day the NAV per share increases based on the net income of the fund: the excess Treasury Bill interest income over any USTB expenses or the management fee. At the end of the year, NAV prepares the annual financial statements and prepares tax filings for all investors who owned shares during the prior fiscal year. The daily NAV is available per API and is published on our website.</p>\n<p>Ernst &amp; Young LLP, one of the ‘Big Four’ accounting firms, performs annual financial statement audits for USTB. The first audit of USTB will be for FY 2024 and will begin in January 2025. The audit will be conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAS”), as established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”).</p>\n<p>The results of this audit should be completed by March 2025 and will be made available to Spark for review.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

Key functions, like minting tokens and managing the allowlist, are securely controlled by the Superstate Admin Address to ensure proper oversight and compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>b) USTB:</strong></p>\n<p>A standard Upgradable OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation with a few changes:</p>\n<p>USTB verifies that all holders are on the Superstate-controlled AllowList and are authorized for the specific token.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Burn</strong> - Investors can call the burn function or transfer their USTB token to the contract address to initiate a redemption</li>\n<li><strong>Mint</strong> - Superstate can call the mint function to mint new USTB token shares when investors subscribe to USTB</li>\n<li><strong>Encumber functionality</strong> (see our docs: <a href=\"https://docs.superstate.co/superstate/smart-contracts#encumber\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Smart Contracts | Superstate</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>c) Transfers:</strong></p>\n<p>USTB tokens can be freely transferred between Ethereum addresses on the AllowList using <code>transfer</code> or <code>transferFrom</code> functions. Each transaction is verified to ensure both sender and receiver are on the AllowList and authorized for the specific token.</p>\n<p><strong>d) AllowList:</strong></p>\n<p>Adds/Removes Ethereum addresses to/from the AllowList with certain permissions. Right now, only the first two booleans in the <code>Permission</code> struct are used. <code>Permission.disallowed</code> means the entity is onboarded to USTB.</p>\n<p>Ethereum addresses are also grouped by their Entity ID. Entity IDs are how Superstate identifies investors The USTB token contract calls <code>getPermission</code> on the AllowList contract to see if the sender and receiver of USTB token are permitted to hold it.</p>\n<p>Only the Superstate Admin Address can make any changes to the AllowList, using the following functions <code>setEntityIdForAddress</code>, <code>setEntityIdForMultipleAddresses</code>, <code>setPermission</code>, <code>setEntityPermissionAndAddresses</code>, and <code>setNthPermission</code>. We call these functions when onboarding or offboarding an investor.</p>\n<p>We only add Ethereum addresses for investors who have successfully completed our KYC / Investment Agreement processes.</p>\n<p><strong>e) USTB Oracle:</strong></p>\n<p>Chainlink is responsible for putting the USTB NAV/S price onchain. The Oracle contract uses the AggregatorV3Interface:</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#functions-in-aggregatorv3interface\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/a/1/a1ba340d4dcc99d51a3d7351da77583ec4509cf8.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"375BD2\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#functions-in-aggregatorv3interface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chainlink Documentation</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/2/f22b907f3210aad29bf6568772454c87be003e0c_2_690x362.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF2FC\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#functions-in-aggregatorv3interface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockchain Oracles for Connected Smart Contracts | Chainlink Documentation</a></h3>\n\n  <p>API reference for using Chainlink Data Feeds in smart contracts.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>This oracle provides the most up-to-date USTB NAV/S price and functions like other Chainlink oracles.</p>\n<p><strong>f) Additional Technical Products and Services:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Onboarding:</em> We’ve developed a proprietary onboarding tool that simplifies the process of onboarding to USTB, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.</p>\n<p><em>Investor Portal:</em> Superstate’s Investor Portal allows Investors to manage and track their portfolio with ease, offering real-time access to account information.</p>\n<p><em>APIs for Real-Time Data:</em> Our APIs offer instant access to NAV/S, ensuring Investors have the most current information at their fingertips.</p>\n<p><em>Fireblocks:</em> We utilize Fireblocks m/n MPC infrastructure to implement admin controls, requiring approval for minting tokens or adding an address to the AllowList.</p>\n<p><em>Internal Reconciliation:</em> We conduct thorough internal reconciliation reporting, daily, to ensure all token balances and financial metrics are accurate and consistent.</p>\n<p><em>Public Website:</em> Our website provides detailed fund information such as holdings, yield, and NAV and serves as a central resource for investors.</p>\n<p>Superstate’s technical implementation is built to support secure, transparent, and user-friendly investment products, meeting the needs of modern clients.

Beyond yield, how might your product benefit the Spark Star and Sky ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>USTB offers investors stability and peace of mind, delivering uncorrelated returns in a simple ERC-20. Sub-advised by Federated Hermes, USTB brings 50+ years of professional asset management on-chain. USTB’s portfolio manager, Sue Hill, has 30+ years of experience and is directly responsible for managing $300B+ AUM across multiple funds.</p>\n<p>By onboarding to USTB, the Sky ecosystem may easily access other products offered by Superstate Inc., including USCC and future offerings.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, USTB promises supreme transparency. Today, anyone can see USTB’s holdings, daily NAV, yield, and more by visiting: <a href=\"https://superstate.co/ustb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://superstate.co/ustb<br>\n</a>We have partnered with Chainlink to create a Proof Of Reserve oracles on-chain. These transparency features easily integrate into existing and future Sky infrastructure developed by Powerhouse, BA Labs, and Steakhouse Financial.</p>\n<p>Superstate Inc. organizes and manages the Superstate Industry Council (SIC), a collective of leading traditional and digital asset institutions dedicated to advancing tokenization in traditional finance and capital markets. We are proud to welcome 10+ prominent institutions, in our most recent cohort, bringing the total number of members to 35.

Does the product have integrations with any other platforms?</strong></p>\n<p>We are currently exploring integrations with major DeFi protocols including Morpho, Uniswap, Euler, Pendle, and more. USTB is currently integrated with major custodians including Fireblocks, BitGo, Anchorage, and more are on the way.</p>\n<p>Our vision for Superstate is to make our products widely accessible across different ecosystems and protocols to benefit onchain investors. We are actively engaging with lending protocols, DEXs, and various blockchain networks to ensure our products are available where they will provide the most utility possible in a compliant manner.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you offer or plan to offer other products that could be appropriate for Spark or other Stars?</strong></p>\n<p>Superstate recently launched the <a href=\"https://superstate.co/uscc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Superstate Crypto Carry Fund</a> (“USCC”), a private, tokenized fund for qualified purchasers, offering exposure to the crypto “cash-and-carry” trade. USCC provides risk-managed exposure to crypto basis, leveraging price differences between spot and futures markets for Bitcoin and Ether while optimizing yield and risk across basis opportunities, staking, and U.S. Treasury securities.</p>\n<p>USCC is a series of a Delaware Trust, separate from Superstate, ensuring assets are bankruptcy remote. The Fund is opportunistically managed, with a current 30-day yield of 14.13% (as of 08/28/2024) and a legal structure consistent with USTB. It offers daily liquidity, low fees, and subscription and redemption via fiat or USDC. By onboarding to USTB, Spark and future Stars could more seamlessly access USCC and other future products managed by Superstate Inc.</p>\n<p>As shared above, Superstate will be launching additional tokenized financial products in the future and will collaborate with Spark or other Stars to understand what other strategies/exposures might be suitable.</p>\n<p>As we build secondary markets, we’ll also engage Spark and other Stars to understand how they can get better utility and capital efficiency by integrating our products across various protocols or systems, subject to legal and regulatory constraints.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98628-glossary-of-terms-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98628-glossary-of-terms-8\"></a>Glossary of Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AllowList Addresses:</strong> Ethereum addresses that are approved to interact with send / receive USTB tokens, listed by Investors or Superstate Inc.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Primary AllowList Address:</strong> The main address designated by Investors for core receiving and custodying USTB token .</li>\n<li><strong>Secondary AllowList Address:</strong> Additional addresses with specific roles or permissions, often for auxiliary functions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>USTB Purchase Address:</strong> Client-specfic Circle address used specifically for purchasing and subscribing to USTB with USDC.</li>\n<li><strong>USDC Proceeds Address:</strong> Client-specfic Ethereum address where USDC proceeds from redemptions are deposited.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-ustb/24974\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-ustb/24974","pubDate":"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:04:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24974"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/tokenization-grand-prix-application-ustb/24974.rss","#text":"Tokenization Grand Prix Application - USTB"},"filter":false},{"title":"Real-World Asset Report - 2024-07","dc:creator":"steakhouse","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>Below you will find the July 2024 update on Maker’s Real-World Asset exposure.

A separate application for preliminary discovery has been filed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Regarding our argument on “actual or apparent possession” of the goods that the Liquidator sold upon his appointment, we faced some challenges. While we had a strong enough argument to seek preliminary discovery, the Buyer Trade Finance Agreement (BTFA) does not entirely circumvent the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR) requirements in Australia. The PPSR ensures transparency regarding who has a security interest in goods through registration or possession.</em></p>\n<p><em>Despite these challenges, there is still potential for claims against the Liquidator if the documents reveal that he was aware of any wrongdoing by Hanhwa concerning our goods. Similarly, we may have claims against Directed if it is shown that they were aware of the BTFA when acquiring the goods before liquidation.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Court has not yet delivered a judgment, which is an unusual delay. The delay could indicate that the Registrar is carefully considering which documents should be provided, but it is difficult to determine the exact cause. The Registrar may simply have a heavy workload.</em></p>\n<p><em>With Hanhwa director now bankrupted and out of the picture, our straightforward claim has become more complex. Our chances of success against the Liquidator and Directed will largely depend on the Registrar’s decision on our preliminary discovery application and the documents produced. Once we have access to these documents, we will be able to provide a more informed opinion.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your continued patience and support. We will keep you informed of any further developments.</em></p>\n<p>As a reminder, on August 24th of 2023, Steakhouse and ConsolFreight <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/consolfreight-rwa-003-cf4-drop-default/21745\">alerted</a> MakerDAO that the pools largest position, Hanhwa, was expected to default.

Built on the oldest and most profitable decentralized finance protocol. Powering a scalable ecosystem of <strong>Stars</strong>.</h3>\n<p>After more than 2 years of meticulous work by the ecosystem, Sky is here! MakerDAO is now Sky, and the long anticipated upgrades to the protocol and ecosystem - known by the codename Endgame - are now coming to life.</p>\n<p>Decentralized Finance is at an inflection point. The industry has successfully matured and scaled and, with the right push, is poised to begin providing large scale value to regular people. By focusing on delivering innovative ways for everyday users to unlock the inherent benefits of DeFi, Sky will do its part in bringing the benefits of DeFi to the mass market.</p>\n<p>With Sky, the Maker Protocol has used its decentralized governance processes to upgrade and extend itself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Two upgraded tokens: USDS and SKY</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new website and DeFi app: Sky.money (maintained by an independent entity)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Brand new killer feature: Native Token Rewards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ecosystem scalability breakthrough: Stars (Formerly known as SubDAOs) are small, specialized, decentralized ecosystems within the broader Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next chapter of DeFi starts with the introduction of Sky and continues with rapid releases of all of the core features of Sky outlined above. Here’s what’s next for Sky:</p>\n<p><em>All of the features mentioned in this post have been approved by the governance process and specified in the Atlas: <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP107#7-1-1-newgovtoken-newstable-token-rewards\" class=\"inline-onebox\">MIPs Portal</a></em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-token-and-product-launch-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-token-and-product-launch-3\"></a>Token and Product Launch</h1>\n<p>Token and Product Launch is on September 18, and this is the moment everything goes live.</p>\n<p>This release will introduce the foundational elements of Sky.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-usds-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-usds-4\"></a>USDS</h2>\n<p>The upgraded stablecoin of the Sky Ecosystem is USDS.</p>\n<p>USDS can be upgraded from Dai or converted from USDC at a 1:1 ratio, on Sky.money and other frontends. USDS can also be converted back to Dai. Upgrading is optional.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>USDS will have access to SKY Token Rewards from the moment it launches. These rewards are built into the Sky Protocol, which means that the user doesn’t have to get exposed to external protocols with unknown risk. All eligible users are doing is using USDS you own inside the Sky Protocol itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The SKY Token Reward will be distributed at a rate of 600 million SKY per year, across participating USDS holders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>USDS users can also choose to instead get the regular Savings Rate, which has already been successfully used by billions of dollars for several years.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sky Token Rewards and Savings Rate are restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-sky-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-sky-5\"></a>SKY</h2>\n<p>The Governance Token of the Sky Ecosystem is SKY.</p>\n<p>MKR holders can upgrade their MKR to SKY, and SKY can also be converted back to MKR. Upgrading is optional.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Users get 24,000 SKY per MKR when they upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At Launch, the Smart Burn Engine will move to target the SKY/USDS market with all of its current liquidity and all future automatic liquidity acquisition from Protocol Surplus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At later stages of Sky Launch Season, SKY will gain additional features including Sealed Activation and Regular Activation, which gives eligible users USDS and Token Rewards for committed participation in Sky Governance. These functionalities are restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-skymoney-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-skymoney-6\"></a>Sky.money</h2>\n<p>Sky.money is a decentralized gateway to the Sky Ecosystem and provides access to the key features of the Sky Protocol, including upgrading Dai to USDS, and MKR to SKY.</p>\n<p>Sky.money also enables eligible users to access the Sky Protocol to use USDS to earn SKY tokens as Native Token Rewards and to get the Savings Rate on USDS.</p>\n<p>It is designed to be as easy and simple to use as possible and to set a standard for other projects that provide access to the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-early-bird-bonus-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-early-bird-bonus-7\"></a>Early Bird Bonus</h2>\n<p>Until September 18, users can sign up on Sky.money for the Early Bird Bonus. Once SKY tokens become available as Token Rewards, those who signed up in advance for the Early Bird Bonus, and are eligible, will receive double the SKY Token Rewards for a month after September 18. The Early Bird Bonus is restricted in some countries including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-features-coming-shortly-after-september-18-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-features-coming-shortly-after-september-18-8\"></a>Features coming shortly after September 18</h1>\n<p>After the core elements described above go live, Sky will focus on bringing the next round of innovations to market. The following are expected to be live soon after the initial 18 September launch date.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-sealed-activation-launch-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-sealed-activation-launch-9\"></a>Sealed Activation Launch</h1>\n<p>Soon after the launch of USDS, SKY, Sky.money and Token Rewards, the Sealed Activation feature will launch.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation encourages long term governance participation by enabling MKR and SKY holders to Seal their tokens behind an Exit Fee in return for Rewards.</p>\n<p>Both SKY and MKR can be Sealed.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-sealed-activation-rewards-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-sealed-activation-rewards-10\"></a>Sealed Activation Rewards</h2>\n<p>Eligible users that have Sealed their MKR or SKY receive Activation Rewards. Initially, Activation Rewards are only available in the form of USDS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>25% of all protocol stablecoin surplus earned by the Maker Protocol is distributed proportionally as Activation Rewards to Sealed MKR and SKY.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the Spark Star launches, Sealed Activation users will also be able to choose to receive SPK tokens.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15% of all SPK tokens earmarked for Token Rewards are distributed proportionally as Activation Rewards to Sealed Activation users that have chosen to receive SPK yield.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sealed Activation is restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-unsealing-exit-fee-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-unsealing-exit-fee-11\"></a>Unsealing Exit Fee</h2>\n<p>In exchange for the benefits of using Sealed Activation, and to encourage long term commitment and governance participation, Sealed SKY and MKR tokens pay a 5% Exit Fee when they are Unsealed.</p>\n<p>This fee is burned by the protocol, and is subtracted from the principal that was originally Sealed. Token Rewards earned from Sealing are unaffected by the Exit Fee.</p>\n<p>The Exit Fee begins at 5% when Sealed Activation launches, and increases by 1% every 6 months for the next 5 years until it reaches 15%, which is the permanent Exit Fee.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-sky-regular-activation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-sky-regular-activation-12\"></a>SKY Regular Activation</h1>\n<p>A couple of weeks after the launch of Sealed Activation, alongside Skylink and Spark launch, SKY will also get a new feature called Activation. This is a less committed version of Sealed Activation, where SKY holders receive Activation Rewards, but don’t have to Seal their tokens behind and Exit Fee. SKY can be freely Activated and Deactivated instantly, at any time.</p>\n<p>Initially when Activation launches, SKY holders will be eligible to get 15% of the total SPK supply as Activation Rewards.</p>\n<p>SKY Regular Activation is restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-skylink-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-skylink-13\"></a>Skylink</h1>\n<p>Skylink is designed to be the multichain solution of the Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>After the launch of Sealed Activation Skylink will launch and begin connecting USDS, SKY and other Sky Ecosystem tokens from Ethereum Mainnet to major L2s.</p>\n<p>Skylink makes all of the core Sky features available on the L2s and blockchains it is deployed to, including: Native USDS, Native Sky Savings Rate, Native Token Rewards, native 1:1 conversion between USDC and USDS.</p>\n<p>Skylink deployments to additional L2s and L1s will follow later.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-spark-the-first-sky-star-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spark-the-first-sky-star-14\"></a>Spark: the first Sky Star</h1>\n<p>Formerly known as SubDAOs, Stars are smaller, specialized, decentralized ecosystems that exist within the broader Sky Ecosystem and are tied to the Sky Protocol.</p>\n<p>Spark is the first Star. The launch of the Spark Governance Token - the SPK token - and the start of multichain (via Skylink) SPK Token Rewards are hotly anticipated elements of the new system.</p>\n<p>All Star tokens, including the SPK token of Spark, are distributed primarily through the Sky Token Rewards that USDS can access. Only a small amount of SPK will be distributed to contributor teams, enabling a much more decentralized and diverse token distribution.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-sparklend-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-sparklend-15\"></a>SparkLend</h2>\n<p>Spark specializes in providing high quality, easy to use DeFi products backed by the economic scale of the Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The main product of Spark is SparkLend, available on <a href=\"http://spark.fi\">spark.fi</a></p>\n<p>SparkLend is a modern lending engine where users can directly self-generate USDS using crypto as collateral.</p>\n<p>SparkLend launched a year ago, and is already very popular, currently around the 10th biggest DeFi platform by TVL in the world.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98600-spk-airdrop-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spk-airdrop-16\"></a>SPK Airdrop</h3>\n<p>Eligible users of SparkLend are already able to pre-farm the SPK Airdrop today, which will grant them SPK tokens distributed out in a single Airdrop when SPK launches.</p>\n<p>Eligible users of SparkLend can check the SPK tokens they’ve accrued so far on <a href=\"https://spark.blockanalitica.com/v1/ethereum/airdrop/\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Spark | Block Analitica</a></p>\n<p>The SPK Airdrop is separate from the SPK Token Rewards, described below.</p>\n<p>SPK Airdrop will be restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-allocation-system-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-allocation-system-17\"></a>Allocation System</h2>\n<p>In addition to maintaining its own lending protocol, Spark also specializes in allocating capital to the broader DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This is done through the Allocation System, which is an upcoming mechanism in the Sky Protocol that allows Stars to borrow from Sky at a cheaper rate, and then allocate it to the best protocols and platforms in the broader DeFi Ecosystem</p>\n<p>As an example, Spark currently controls a Morpho Lending Market system that is used to allocate hundreds of millions of USD towards the Ethena sUSDe tokenized perpetual swap basis trade.</p>\n<p>Spark has also announced the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/announcement-spark-tokenization-grand-prix-request-for-proposal/24631\">Spark Tokenization Grand Prix</a>, which ultimately will give Spark the ability to deploy billions of MakerDAO collateral into the safest and best developed tokenized RWA assets through the Allocation System. For the time being, the final decisions still require approval by governance.</p>\n<p>MakerDAO has years of experience being the leading RWA protocol, and this expertise and responsibility is being handed over to Spark, in order to make future RWA related innovation move faster.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-spark-tokenomics-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spark-tokenomics-18\"></a>Spark Tokenomics</h2>\n<p>The moment Spark Launches, the SPK token will be available as Token Rewards for eligible USDS users both on Ethereum mainnet and L2s. Token Rewards on L2s will have very low transaction fees. Eligible Sealed Activation users will also be able to get SPK tokens the moment Spark launches.</p>\n<p>SPK Token Rewards are separate from the SPK Airdrop, described above.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-spk-reward-distribution-rates-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spk-reward-distribution-rates-19\"></a>SPK Reward distribution rates</h2>\n<p>As specified by the governance process, the rate of SPK distribution will be 1 billion tokens per year the first 2 years. This will halve every 2 years until a total of 4 billion SPK tokens have been distributed after 10 years.</p>\n<p>This total distribution will be divided as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>USDS users will receive Token Rewards at a rate of 700 million SPK tokens per year</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activated SKY will receive SPK Activation Rewards at a rate of 150 million SPK tokens per year</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sealed SKY or MKR will receive SPK Activation Rewards at a rate of 150 million SPK tokens per year.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This rate will remain in place for the first two years following Spark launch, after which all rates will halve, as described above.</p>\n<p>SPK Token Rewards are restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-spk-activation-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spk-activation-20\"></a>SPK Activation</h2>\n<p>The SPK token will have built in Activation Rewards from the moment it launches. SPK Activation will be available both on Ethereum mainnet and L2s.</p>\n<p>Activated SPK will receive SKY Activation Rewards at a rate of 80 million SKY per year, available for eligible users.</p>\n<p>SPK Token Rewards are restricted in some countries, including the US and UK, and for VPN users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-spark-governance-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-spark-governance-21\"></a>Spark Governance</h2>\n<p>Spark will have a community governance mechanism controlled by SPK token voting. Over time Spark Governance will run all aspects of Spark autonomously, within the framework of the Sky Star ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-legal-structures-in-the-sky-ecosystem-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-legal-structures-in-the-sky-ecosystem-22\"></a>Legal structures in the Sky Ecosystem</h1>\n<p>Proactively and securely dealing with legal and regulatory risks has always been a top priority for the ecosystem, and as the industry keeps growing and the opportunities increase, so does legal and regulatory risk and complexity. The legal structure strategy in the Sky Ecosystem has been intended to ensure Sky Governance maintains the ability to make decentralized decisions without being influenced by leverage from external entities.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-ip-ownership-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-ip-ownership-23\"></a>IP Ownership</h2>\n<p>Key IP of the Sky Ecosystem will be held in a foundation that is still in progress, modelled after the approach used for the Dai Foundation, and expanded to cover the new usecases necessary with Sky.</p>\n<p>Specific information about this foundation will be published later, as some of the legal details still need to be finalized and providing too much information early could just increase confusion. The intention is to ensure that Sky Governance retains critical decision making power over all crucial IP assets relevant to the Sky Ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98600-skymoney-maintenance-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-skymoney-maintenance-24\"></a>Sky.money maintenance</h2>\n<p>The Sky.money domain will be owned by the dedicated IP foundation in time for the September 18 launch, and the Foundation then assigns an entity to operate and maintain a website and DeFi app on the domain.</p>\n<p>The entity currently doing this is Skybase, which is an independent private crypto and fintech company that is owned by companies connected to my own (Rune) holding company. Skybase is designed to be able to handle all of the legal, technical and marketing requirements that is needed to effectively operate Sky.money.</p>\n<p>It does not earn any money directly from these operations, and instead is just set up to be funded through the Launch Project.</p>\n<p>The initial scope of Skybase is very limited to just maintaining Sky.money, but it is set up to be maximally independent, separate, resilient, compliant and above board in how it handles this responsibility.</p>\n<p>I’m currently working on ideas for proposals about how the scope of Skybase, and other similar to entities, can be expanded to improve the ability of the Sky Ecosystem to offer DeFi products that are easy to use, and more smoothly integrated into users existing financial systems and applications while still providing a DeFi experience at their core. However, this will only be relevant if Sky Launch Season is a success.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98600-support-the-sky-launch-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98600-support-the-sky-launch-25\"></a>Support the Sky launch!</h1>\n<p>The potential of DeFi is enormous, and the entire financial system as we know it might be reshaped in the coming decades to be more decentralized, transparent, efficient and fair.</p>\n<p>Sky is here to do its part, and as a decentralized ecosystem there are many ways you can help too.</p>\n<p>If you’re a builder in the DeFi space, you can learn how to integrate and gain benefits and support on the Sky X account: <span class=\"mention\">@SkyEcosystem</span></p>\n<p>If you want to be a part of the launch, go to Sky.money and check out the new brand and sign up for the Early Bird Bonus</p>\n<p>Don’t forget to follow <span class=\"mention\">@SkyEcosystem</span> on X, as there will be a lot of really exciting updates and releases leading up to the full launch of Sky on September 18!</p>\n            <p><small>26 posts - 14 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959","pubDate":"Tue, 27 Aug 2024 12:25:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24959"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sky-has-arrived/24959.rss","#text":"Sky has arrived!"},"filter":false},{"title":"Article on Tokenization Process of RWA","dc:creator":"Akira_Maker","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p><em>Hi everybody!</em></p>\n<p><em>I’ve written an article on the Tokenization Process of RWAs.</em></p>\n<p><em>The article is meant as a learning tool for myself and others that might be interested in the development of RWAs.</em></p>\n<p><em>I am happy to receive critique or remarks on the work and suggestions to further research.</em></p>\n<p><em>The article can also be read on mirror here: <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0xF13166E10e9A4DcD56eBe102789a52e8b58aD1dC/NECseyfkIz2KC3J7kvgdV8vMXQkLz5f4QNo99lfWaX8?referrerAddress=0xF13166E10e9A4DcD56eBe102789a52e8b58aD1dC\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">A Breakdown of RWA Tokenization — Akira</a></em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98587-introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Tokenizing RWAs as a concept is fairly easy to understand at a fundamental level. It is the process of creating a digital token on the blockchain that is linked to a real-world asset off-chain.

If you already know these basic concepts, you can scroll down to the section: Tokenization Process. And for those that could use a recap, here is a quick rundown of the concepts and principles that are needed to understand the tokenization process.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-rwa-categorization-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-rwa-categorization-3\"></a><strong>RWA Categorization</strong></h3>\n<p>We can differentiate between a RWA with these three traits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Asset Location: On-Chain or Off-Chain</li>\n<li>Collateral Location: On-Chain or Off-Chain</li>\n<li>Backing type: Direct or Indirect</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/Quillhash/Real-World-Assets\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">QuillHash</a></p>\n<p><strong>Asset Location</strong></p>\n<p>This refers to whether the asset being tokenized is on-chain or off-chain. Since RWAs are typically off-chain, it generally makes sense to focus on assets with an off-chain location. An example of on-chain assets being tokenized are wrapped tokens like WBTC or WETH, though these are not considered RWAs.</p>\n<p>There are rare cases where an asset’s location is on-chain from the start, such as certain intellectual properties, patents, or copyrights. These assets hold intrinsic value and exist solely on-chain.</p>\n<p><strong>Collateral Location</strong></p>\n<p>Just like the asset location, collateral can also be either on-chain or off-chain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Off-chain collateral</strong>: USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the USD, with each USDT backed by 1 USD held in a collateral reserve, which is off-chain.</li>\n<li><strong>On-chain collateral</strong>: DAI, a stablecoin issued by MakerDAO, is soft-pegged to the USD and uses other cryptocurrencies as collateral, making it on-chain collateral.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, MakerDAO has also invested in RWAs and used these RWAs as collateral, which makes the collateral for DAI a bit meta.

Unlike traditional contracts, smart contracts are written in code, typically using the Solidity programming language. These contracts are stored on the blockchain, ensuring they are secure, transparent, and immutable.</p>\n<p>To create a smart contract, developers often use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Once deployed, a smart contract functions as a set of predefined actions that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. This process eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, making the contract fully transparent and accessible for anyone to verify.</p>\n<p>In short, smart contracts are self-executing agreements where the terms are embedded in code, ensuring that they are enforced and executed automatically without the need for intermediaries.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-token-standards-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-token-standards-5\"></a><strong>Token Standards</strong></h3>\n<p>Token standards are a set of rules or protocols that dictate how tokens are created, issued, and behave on a blockchain. These standards ensure that tokens can interact seamlessly with smart contracts, wallets, and other applications within the same ecosystem. Each blockchain may have its own token standards, but the most well-known ones are from the Ethereum blockchain, where the concept of token standards became widely popular.</p>\n<p>• <strong>ERC-20:</strong> The most widely used standard for fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and support basic functions like transfers and balance checks. For example, each DAI token is identical in value and function to another DAI.</p>\n<p>• <strong>ERC-721:</strong> The standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which represent unique assets like digital art or collectibles. Each token has a distinct value and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis with another token.</p>\n<p>• <strong>ERC-1155:</strong> A versatile standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens within the same contract, commonly used in gaming for managing various token types, such as in-game currency and unique items.</p>\n<p>• <strong>ERC-1400:</strong> A standard designed for security tokens, representing traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds. It includes features for regulatory compliance, such as restricting transfers to authorized users.</p>\n<p>• <strong>ERC-3643:</strong> An evolution of ERC-1400, ERC-3643 is a standard specifically tailored for regulated security tokens. It enhances compliance features, including more sophisticated access controls and automated compliance checks, making it ideal for institutional and regulated markets. This standard is often used for RWAs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-oracles-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-oracles-6\"></a><strong>Oracles</strong></h3>\n<p>Oracles are used to bring real-world information onto the blockchain securely. Since blockchains operate as isolated systems, they can’t access data outside their network on their own. Oracles serve as the bridge between the blockchain and the outside world, enabling smart contracts to interact with external information, such as real-world events, asset prices, or other data feeds.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98587-tokenization-process-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-tokenization-process-7\"></a><strong>Tokenization Process</strong></h2>\n<p>Now that we’ve covered the fundamental concepts, let’s explore the practical steps involved in tokenizing a RWA, using the example of a U.S. Treasury Bond (T-bill). This process will demonstrate how a T-bill can be accurately represented on the blockchain, legally compliant, and ready for trading or investment.</p>\n<p>When tokenizing an RWA, an entity first purchases the asset and holds it in reserve. The entity then develops and issues tokens that represent the RWA. These tokens can be transferred and traded on blockchain platforms. As a result, the tokens not only reflect the value of the underlying RWA but also gain the inherent benefits of blockchain technology, such as transparency, transaction speed, and immutability.</p>\n<p>As I aim to cover the whole process of tokenization, I will not deep dive into each step but rather provide a concise and to-the-point overview of the process. For a more in depth analysis of a specific step, I will publish new articles to cover these areas. If you have any subject recommendation you want me to cover, feel free to write to <a href=\"https://x.com/Akira1924445\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Akira1924445</a> on <a href=\"http://X.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X.com</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-1-asset-identification-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-1-asset-identification-8\"></a>1. Asset Identification</h3>\n<p>The first step in the tokenization process is choosing the right asset, with careful consideration of its asset location. When selecting an asset, it’s important to consider factors such as stability, liquidity, market demand, and the asset’s potential for generating returns. T-bills, with their off-chain location, are often selected for tokenization due to their high security, backed by the U.S. government, and predictable returns.</p>\n<p>Key factors to consider when choosing a T-Bill for tokenization include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maturity Period:</strong> T-Bills come with varying maturities, typically ranging from a few days to one year. Longer maturities generally offer higher returns but may involve greater exposure to interest rate changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Interest Rate Environment:</strong> The current interest rate environment influences the purchase price of T-Bills. An inverse relationship exists where rising interest rates generally lead to lower T-Bill prices. Selecting T-Bills during favorable interest rate conditions can enhance the attractiveness of the tokenized product.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> “On-the-run” T-Bills, which are the most recently issued, tend to be more liquid and are typically preferred for tokenization. Higher liquidity ensures that the tokenized T-Bills are easier to trade on secondary markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Market Demand:</strong> Understanding the demand for T-Bills in the market is crucial. High demand for these secure, short-term investments can make the tokenized product more appealing to investors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-2-legal-and-regulatory-compliance-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-2-legal-and-regulatory-compliance-9\"></a>2. Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h3>\n<p>It’s essential that the tokenization of RWAs adheres to both local and international financial regulations. This requires establishing a legal framework that officially recognizes digital tokens as legitimate representations of the underlying RWA. For T-bills, compliance with SEC regulations, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, is paramount.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-3-choosing-the-blockchain-platform-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-3-choosing-the-blockchain-platform-10\"></a>3. Choosing the Blockchain Platform</h3>\n<p>Selecting the appropriate blockchain platform is crucial for the success of the tokenization project. The chosen platform must support the type of tokens being issued and offer the necessary scalability, security, and community support. Ethereum is often selected due to its extensive support for financial instruments and smart contract functionality, making it a strong choice for tokenizing T-bills, especially in projects requiring a robust ecosystem and liquidity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-4-token-standards-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-4-token-standards-11\"></a>4. Token Standards</h3>\n<p>The next step involves choosing or developing a token standard that best suits the characteristics of the asset being tokenized. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.erc3643.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-3643</a> standard is commonly used for tokenizing assets on the Ethereum blockchain, particularly for RWAs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-5-collateralization-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-5-collateralization-12\"></a>5. Collateralization</h3>\n<p>While T-bills are already considered one of the safest financial instruments due to government backing, understanding the Backing Type is crucial in the tokenization process. In this case, the T-bills provide direct backing for the tokens, meaning each token represents a direct claim on the T-bill’s value. This direct backing type ensures that the tokens maintain their value, as they are directly tied to the government-issued T-bills. For instance, the smart contract might ensure that each token is redeemable for a portion of the T-bill’s face value upon maturity, maintaining a 1:1 ratio.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-6-smart-contract-development-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-6-smart-contract-development-13\"></a>6. Smart Contract Development</h3>\n<p>Smart contract development is the next critical step in the tokenization process. The smart contract governs the creation, transfer, and management of the tokens. It mints digital tokens that represent fractional ownership of the T-bill, allowing multiple investors to hold parts of the same bill. The contract also defines the rules for token transfers, any ownership restrictions, and the distribution of interest payments to token holders. For example, for a T-bill with a $10,000 face value, the smart contract could issue 10,000 tokens, each representing $1 of the T-bill’s value. As the T-bill matures and pays interest, the smart contract automatically distributes payments to token holders.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-7-oracles-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-7-oracles-14\"></a>7. Oracles</h3>\n<p>Oracles play a crucial role in providing the smart contract with real-time data, ensuring that the tokenized T-bill accurately reflects its market value and any interest payments. An oracle service can provide real-time data on the current market value of T-bills, interest rate changes, and other relevant financial information. Continuous data feeds are essential for reflecting any changes in the T-bill’s value or the issuance of interest payments, ensuring transparency and accuracy.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-8-token-distribution-and-sale-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-8-token-distribution-and-sale-15\"></a>8. Token Distribution and Sale</h3>\n<p>Once the tokens are minted, they need to be distributed to investors or sold on a marketplace. Initial distribution might involve a private sale to institutional investors or a public Initial Token Offering (ITO) allowing retail investors to participate. After the initial sale, the tokens can be traded on secondary markets, providing liquidity to token holders. This allows investors to enter and exit positions as needed, without waiting for the T-bill’s maturity. For instance, the tokenized T-bills could be listed on a decentralized exchange (DEX) where they can be traded like any other cryptocurrency, with the smart contract ensuring that the underlying value remains intact.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98587-h-9-security-and-audits-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-h-9-security-and-audits-16\"></a>9. Security and Audits</h3>\n<p>Conducting security audits of smart contracts and the overall system architecture is essential to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors. Implementing best practices for secure smart contract development and deploying contracts on testnets for thorough testing are critical steps in ensuring the security and reliability of the tokenization process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98587-implications-and-future-developments-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-implications-and-future-developments-17\"></a><strong>Implications and Future Developments</strong></h2>\n<p>Tokenizing a T-bill represents just one example of how traditional financial instruments can be brought into the blockchain era. This not only democratizes access to government-backed securities but also opens up new avenues for trading and investment in these traditionally stable assets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Future Trends:</strong> As blockchain technology evolves, we might see the tokenization of a broader range of government securities and even cross-border trading of tokenized assets, creating a global market for T-bills.</li>\n<li><strong>Potential Challenges:</strong> Regulatory compliance remains a significant challenge, particularly as governments and financial institutions adapt to the idea of blockchain-based securities. However, the ongoing development of legal frameworks should help mitigate these challenges over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98587-conclusion-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-conclusion-18\"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Tokenizing RWAs like T-bills is a transformative process that bridges traditional financial instruments with the advantages of blockchain technology. By carefully selecting the right assets, ensuring legal compliance, and utilizing robust blockchain platforms and smart contracts, entities can create digital tokens that represent secure and liquid investments. The tokenization of T-bills not only offers enhanced transparency, speed, and accessibility but also opens up new opportunities for global investors and financial innovation.</p>\n<p>As the tokenization process continues to evolve, the potential for broader adoption of blockchain-based securities is immense. However, navigating regulatory landscapes will be crucial in ensuring the successful integration of these digital assets into the global financial system. The future holds exciting possibilities for expanding the tokenization of government securities, potentially leading to a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98587-vision-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98587-vision-19\"></a><strong>Vision</strong></h2>\n<p>In Japanese, the name Akira signifies brightness, clarity, and truth, principles that guide my approach to exploring the complexities of crypto, blockchain, and RWAs.

During the analyzed period, the normalized ETH borrows across these protocols show a very similar pattern for both Aave v3 and Spark, opposed to the path followed by Aave v2 and Compound v3. It is very interesting to note that both Aave v3 and Spark currently have active Lido rewards, while the other two markets don’t. Even though reward distribution differs between the Aave v3 and Spark, the result is likely similar: Spark directly subsidizes loopers by rewarding WETH borrowing; Aave’s supply rewards lead to higher supply yields, attracting more supply, which lowers borrow utilization and rates, thereby enabling more stETH looping, effectively constituting an ‘indirect subsidy’ for loopers.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/e/beb6fb04dd67aa6222f1be44131f91baf5ad0592.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/rd8KI24TTL8UMPAaP0j1nxDFXuq.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beb6fb04dd67aa6222f1be44131f91baf5ad0592_2_624x248.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"rd8KI24TTL8UMPAaP0j1nxDFXuq\" width=\"624\" height=\"248\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beb6fb04dd67aa6222f1be44131f91baf5ad0592_2_624x248.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beb6fb04dd67aa6222f1be44131f91baf5ad0592_2_936x372.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/beb6fb04dd67aa6222f1be44131f91baf5ad0592_2_1248x496.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"232223\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98555-wsteth-supply-analysis-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98555-wsteth-supply-analysis-8\"></a>wstETH Supply Analysis</h2>\n<p>While reward distribution policies might have a similar impact on loopers, the effect on total stETH supply differs.

At the same time, the USD value of their supply declined during the campaign period, only to sharply increase after they ended.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/7/5/75f15441d16cc39e6b7f37ae6d486a405e005991.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gPmUnpOHpmqwb0Euhwmbik7i3xD.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/5/75f15441d16cc39e6b7f37ae6d486a405e005991_2_624x207.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gPmUnpOHpmqwb0Euhwmbik7i3xD\" width=\"624\" height=\"207\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/5/75f15441d16cc39e6b7f37ae6d486a405e005991_2_624x207.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/5/75f15441d16cc39e6b7f37ae6d486a405e005991_2_936x310.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/7/5/75f15441d16cc39e6b7f37ae6d486a405e005991_2_1248x414.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"212220\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This comparison suggests that the true effects of the reward campaign might have a delayed effect that cannot yet be measured.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-98555-conclusion-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98555-conclusion-11\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The new Lido incentives correspond to larger WETH borrow and larger wstETH supply over Spark, which is especially fueled by the loopers segment. This is especially significant when looking at the other asset classes, which have followed the opposite trend both in supply and borrow.</p>\n<p>Compared to other lending markets, the increase of wstETH supply is significantly larger over the analyzed period, while WETH borrows are in line with leading lending markets that have also implemented Lido Incentives.</p>\n<p>A similar pattern can be observed when comparing the previous incentive campaign and the new one, with a stabilized growth of loopers and slight decline in USD supply. The analysis highlights the possibility that the campaign might have a delayed effect which has not yet taken place.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lido-incentives-analysis/24941\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lido-incentives-analysis/24941","pubDate":"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 15:52:52 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24941"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lido-incentives-analysis/24941.rss","#text":"Lido Incentives Analysis"},"filter":true},{"title":"[Aug 23, 2024] Proposal Changes to Spark for Upcoming Spell","dc:creator":"PhoenixLabs","category":"Spark SubDAO","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-98553-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98553-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Phoenix Labs proposes the following changes to SparkLend grouped by individual polls:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>[Mainnet] Oracle Upgrade to ETH, wstETH, rETH and weETH markets to use Aggor</li>\n<li>[Mainnet] Remove WBTC/BTC from kill switch</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98553-rational-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98553-rational-2\"></a>Rational</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-98553-mainnet-oracle-upgrade-to-eth-wsteth-reth-and-weeth-markets-to-use-aggor-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98553-mainnet-oracle-upgrade-to-eth-wsteth-reth-and-weeth-markets-to-use-aggor-3\"></a>[Mainnet] Oracle Upgrade to ETH, wstETH, rETH and weETH markets to use Aggor</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/aggor\">Repository with 2 audits</a></p>\n<p>Aggor is an oracle aggregator which combines Chronicle and Chainlink price feeds to ensure liveness of the market even in the event of malicious price print by 1 of the 2 providers.

Product Information</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Describe the product</p>\n<p>MYUSD is a multi-chain tokenized note secured by mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), short-term US Treasuries, bank demand deposits, and low risk onchain strategies. The yield is distributed to holders by continuous rebases of the token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Describe the underlying asset</p>\n<p>The underlying assets are a combination of US residential Mortgage Servicing Rights, US 1-Month Treasury Bills, and bank demand deposits. The T-Bills shall be kept in a brokerage account as MSR transactions typically require a 1-month lead time. In-kind subscriptions (USDC, DAI) are kept in low risk on-chain strategies until deployed.</p>\n<p>MYUSD intends to purchase mostly MSRs that are Government-Backed, with certain positions in the U.S. treasuries and low-risk crypto yielding strategies for liquidity management.</p>\n<p>Since market conditions fluctuate suddenly and frequently, the portfolio holdings may change and this list is not indicative of future portfolio composition. These portfolio holdings are not intended to be and do not constitute recommendations that others buy, sell, or hold any of the assets or strategies described.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How is yield transferred to the tokenholder (i.e., via rebasing, distributions, price accrual, etc.) and how often?</p>\n<p>Yield is transferred continuously with a rebasing mechanism. This means an address’ token balance increases with every block. All tokens (on all the various chain deployments) follow the same rebase schedule.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the jurisdiction of the issuer and key entities?</p>\n<p>The Issuer, Onsen MYUSD Limited, is registered in Cayman Islands</p>\n<p>The Offshore Feeder, Onsen Assets Mortgage Servicing Rights Fund Ltd., is registered in the British Virgin Islands. It is recognized by the Financial Services Commission of the British Virgin Islands as a private mutual fund pursuant to the section 55(2) of SIBA. Although the Offshore Feeder is recognised, it is not subject to supervision by the Commission or any regulator outside the BVI.</p>\n<p>The Master Fund, Onsen Assets Mortgage Servicing Rights Fund L.P., is registered in the State of Delaware. The business and purpose of the Master Fund is to acquire, own, hold, finance, refinance, sell, pledge, and otherwise encumber or dispose of, mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) for GSEs on a flow and bulk basis pursuant to one or more Excess Spread Agreements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the asset eligibility criteria and/or concentration limitations for the portfolio as defined by the underlying documents?</p>\n<p>There are no concentration limitations for buying MSR portfolios. MSRs would need to be custodied by U.S. regulated master servicer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are any hedging or derivatives permitted in the underlying portfolio?</p>\n<p>We use forward Swaptions to hedge the outsized interest rate decline risks beyond the rate forward curve. This would allow us to ensure the yields are locked in for the duration of the MSRs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide a list of all counterparties and service providers used by your product (i.e., custodians, trustees, reporting agents, exchange agents, banks, etc).

They are invested in low risk, liquid strategies and are used as a pool from which MYUSD can be redeemed. Incoming deposits are automatically included in these reserves and invested in the same strategies. The protocol maintains a target level for the amount of assets available on-chain. As additional deposits are made, the protocol manually deploys a portion of the capital into select MSR pools. Conversely, as more redemptions occur, the protocol redeems select MSR pools and adds capital back to the reserves. Through this method, most of the incoming deposits and redemptions can be effectively matched against each other on-chain which reduces the amount of MSR pool trades that need to take place.</p>\n<p>MYUSD tokens can be redeemed 1:1 for select stablecoins. Redemptions also work via the TokenGateway contract. Normally, they are a two step process. The first step is the initiation which burns user’s MYUSD tokens. After a timeout period passes the claim is then automatically processed for the user and the stablecoin of their choosing is sent to them. The user can also opt for a “fast” redemption which happens instantly. This will incur a fee. Both the fee and the timeout period length are updatable by the multisig contract which controls the TokenGateway contract. In times of low reserve balances, redemptions can take longer as off-chain assets will need to be unwound.

Technical Description</h1>\n<p>MYUSD is a multi-chain yield-bearing stablecoin backed by a basket of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). The yield is distributed to holders by continuous rebases of the token.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98526-deposits-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-deposits-15\"></a>Deposits</h2>\n<p>Deposits into MYUSD are initiated via a TokenGateway contract which has the ability to mint new MYUSD tokens. The TokenGateway contract accepts select stablecoins (USDC, DAI) and mints new MYUSD tokens to the user at a 1:1 ratio. The tokens immediately start rebasing at the protocol’s ongoing rate. The TokenGateway contract has a limit on how many tokens it can mint. This limit is updatable by the multisig contract which controls it.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98526-contract-calls-to-issue-myusd-with-dai-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-contract-calls-to-issue-myusd-with-dai-16\"></a>Contract calls to issue MYUSD with DAI:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>DAI.approve(TokenGateway, daiAmount)</li>\n<li>TokenGateway.issue(DAI, daiAmount)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98526-reserve-balances-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-reserve-balances-17\"></a>Reserve balances</h2>\n<p>The protocol keeps a portion of its assets on-chain in stablecoins. They are invested in low risk, liquid strategies and are used as a pool from which MYUSD can be redeemed. Incoming deposits are automatically included in these reserves and invested in the same strategies. The protocol maintains a target level for the amount of assets available on-chain.</p>\n<p>As additional deposits are made, the protocol manually deploys a portion of the capital into select MSR pools. Conversely, as more redemptions occur, the protocol redeems select MSR pools and adds capital back to the reserves.</p>\n<p>Through this method, most of the incoming deposits and redemptions can be effectively matched against each other on-chain which reduces the amount of MSR pool trades that need to take place.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98526-redemptions-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-redemptions-18\"></a>Redemptions</h2>\n<p>MYUSD tokens can be redeemed 1:1 for select stablecoins. Redemptions also work via the TokenGateway contract. Normally, they are a two step process. The first step is the initiation which burns user’s MYUSD tokens. After a timeout period passes the claim is then automatically processed for the user and the stablecoin of their choosing is sent to them.</p>\n<p>The user can also opt for a “fast” redemption which happens instantly. This will incur a fee. Both the fee and the timeout period length are updatable by the multisig contract which controls the TokenGateway contract. In times of low reserve balances, redemptions can take longer as off-chain assets will need to be unwound. As new assets become available the existing redemption requests are served on a first come first served basis.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98526-contract-calls-to-redeem-myusd-for-dai-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-contract-calls-to-redeem-myusd-for-dai-19\"></a>Contract calls to redeem MYUSD for DAI:</h4>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>MYUSD.approve(TokenGateway, myUsdAmount)</li>\n<li>TokenGateway.initiateRedeem(myUsdAmount, DAI)</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"p-98526-contract-calls-to-fast-redeem-myusd-for-dai-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-contract-calls-to-fast-redeem-myusd-for-dai-20\"></a>Contract calls to fast redeem MYUSD for DAI:</h4>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>MYUSD.approve(TokenGateway, myUsdAmount)</li>\n<li>TokenGateway.fastRedeem(myUsdAmount, DAI)</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/f/5f1a9705fa8cd27c4ab9b9d5483e34ea8f5872d6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dzkkmeIDodquZqPOdCB3MH05VVI.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/5/f/5f1a9705fa8cd27c4ab9b9d5483e34ea8f5872d6.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"dzkkmeIDodquZqPOdCB3MH05VVI\" width=\"499\" height=\"413\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-98526-makerdao-integration-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#p-98526-makerdao-integration-21\"></a>MakerDao integration</h2>\n<p>MakerDao should also use the TokenGateway contract to enter and exit MYUSD.
