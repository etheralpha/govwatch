SparkLend is uniquely positioned to be the growth engine for stETH adoption. This unique positioning is due to the e-mode “high ltv” looping being exclusive to wstETH, rETH, and ETH.</p>\n<p>SparkLend boasts the second-largest amount of borrowable ETH available with 239k deposited (830m USD) at the time of writing. This ETH market is almost entirely devoted to wstETH looping which means that nearly 100% of rewards expenditures on the ETH market will result in increased market share for Lido.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#background-2\"></a>Background</h2>\n<p>Spark is the first Maker subDAO, with a mission to accelerate the growth and adoption of the DAI by integrating top DeFi solutions. Since its inception, Spark has launched three products: SparkLend, Spark Cash &amp; Savings, and Spark Conduits. SparkLend, in particular, has become one of the top three lending markets in DeFi, with 40,000 ETH available for borrowing.</p>\n<p>Maker has a long-standing partnership with Lido, having been one of the first protocols to onboard wstETH as collateral for DAI loans. SparkLend continues this alignment by being the most compatible lending protocol with Lido for wstETH looping. This is achieved by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>SPK Rewards on ETH Supply Side</strong>: SparkLend offers SPK rewards to those who supply ETH, incentivizing participation and liquidity in the market.</li>\n<li><strong>Restricted Asset Set in ETH e-mode</strong>: SparkLend restricts the set of allowed assets in the ETH e-mode to wstETH, rETH, and ETH. This strategic limitation benefits Lido’s market share by focusing on assets that promote Lido.</li>\n<li><strong>Low ETH Reserve Factor</strong>: SparkLend’s ETH market has the lowest take rate, 5%, improving the rate for suppliers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These measures ensure that SparkLend is closely aligned with Lido, reinforcing the long-standing partnership and supporting the growth of Lido’s ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposal-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposal-3\"></a>Proposal</h2>\n<p>Phoenix Labs has initiated a program of 225 wstETH provided by Lido over 90 days, to be paid as incentives on the SparkLend ETH market borrow side. The trial can be extended if both parties desire.</p>\n<p>Lido has already transferred the rewards to the pre-authorized multisig: <code>0x8076807464DaC94Ac8Aa1f7aF31b58F73bD88A27</code></p>\n<p>Prior approval for reward program management by the above multisig has been made by governance <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/spark-spell-proposed-changes/23298#ethereum-activate-lido-rewards-program-7\">here</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lido-spark-rewards-program/24733\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lido-spark-rewards-program/24733","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jul 2024 16:01:01 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24733"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/lido-spark-rewards-program/24733.rss","#text":"Lido Spark Rewards Program"},"filter":true},{"title":"Technical Overview: Lightweight Peg Stability Module (dss-lite-psm)","dc:creator":"Dewiz","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h2><a name=\"foreword-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#foreword-1\"></a>Foreword</h2>\n<p>LitePSM is the result of 18 months of combined efforts of several Ecosystem Actors.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://dewiz.xyz\">Dewiz</a> signed up for the task of building the new iteration of the PSM, we had only a grasp on the complexity that is involved in building contracts that close to the core. There is no such thing as a module that is easy to build when billions are at stake.</p>\n<p>It was definitely a humbling experience, and we probably would have not seen it through if it were not for the guidance and the patience of some senior members with extensive experience with the Maker Protocol.</p>\n<p>We are proud to present the Maker Community a brand new implementation that will allow for cheaper swaps and also become a source of revenue for the protocol.</p>\n<p>As explained in the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-lite-psm-usdc-a-introduction-and-overview/24512\">introduction post by BA Labs</a>, the migration from the existing PSM to LitePSM will happen in phases. They will co-exist for a while, but we strongly encourage users and integrators to switch to LitePSM as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#overview-2\"></a>Overview</h2>\n<p>A Peg Stability Module (PSM) is a facility through which users can freely swap Dai for stablecoins with no slippage. MakerDAO Governance can enable swap fees, though, which are computed as revenue for the protocol.</p>\n<p>This module is heavily inspired by the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-psm/blob/7d717d88d6b6dfcb346119369647969df6cadad3/src/psm.sol\">current PSM</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-psm/blob/273e4811890fff425b5e3c5f054b2d4d693590fe/src/psm.sol\">PSM v2</a> and some other PSM prototypes within MakerDAO repositories.</p>\n<p>The issue with those implementations is that swapping through them can be quite gas intensive, because they manipulate the <code>Vat</code> (MakerDAO’s main accounting module) directly on every swap.</p>\n<p>To help alleviate this problem, <code>DssLitePsm</code> aims to be more gas efficient. The strategy is to allow users to swap in a <strong>pool</strong> of pre-minted Dai and stablecoins, reducing the swap to 2 ERC-20 token transfers with little overhead.</p>\n<p>The required bookkeeping is done <em>off-band</em> (not to be confused with <em>off-chain</em>), through a set of permissionless functions that aim to keep the pool operating under the predefined constraints, and incorporate the accumulated swap fees into the protocol’s surplus buffer.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is a new requirement – related to MakerDAO Endgame – to allow authorized parties to swap through the PSM without paying any fees, even if they have been activated by Governance. Apart from the existing permissionless <code>buyGem</code> / <code>sellGem</code> functions, this iteration introduces <code>buyGemNoFee</code> / <code>sellGemNoFee</code> permissioned counterparties.</p>\n<p>There is also a new security feature that can be useful in extreme scenarios.  Through an executive spell, MakerDAO Governance can temporarily halt swaps in LitePSM in any direction or in both at the same time. As in other important modules in the Maker Protocol, there is a special Mom contract that can bypass the GSM delay and halt as soon as the corresponding spell obtains enough votes.</p>\n<p>At the same time, in this version <code>gem</code> balance <strong>can</strong> be held in a different address to allow the protocol to receive yield from stablecoins that require the custody of the assets to be segregated. This address can be either an orphaned EOA or a bespoke smart contract. The only constraint is that <code>DssLitePsm</code> <strong>should</strong> be able to freely move any amount of <code>gem</code> on behalf of such address.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, LitePSM fosters Maker Protocol’s operational decentralization, as it reduces the dependency on an arranger with <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/out-of-schedule-executive-to-fortify-elasticity-of-on-chain-1-1-liquidity-of-usdc/21168/58\">manual actions as in Coinbase Custody</a>, while maintaining the ability to obtain yield on holdings.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/dss-lite-psm/tree/2598e2efcb079a27b5580ea416f1c7b27ede4e84\">repository</a> to see it in detail.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"architecture-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#architecture-3\"></a>Architecture</h2>\n<p>A simplified diagram of the <code>DssLitePsm</code> architecture:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">                                                buyGemNoFee /\n                                           ╭────────────────────────  🤴\n ╭─────────╮                               │    sellGemNoFee     Permissioned\n │         │       transferFrom            │                         User\n │   Gem   ◄────────────────────────────╮  │\n │         │                            │  │\n ╰────▲────╯                            │  │\n      │                                 │  │\n      │                                 │  │\n      │ approve ·····╮                  │  │\n      │              ╎                  │  │\n╭─────┴────╮         ╎          ╭───────┴──▼───╮\n│          │         ╎          │              │     buyGem /\n│  Pocket  │         ╰·········&gt;│  DssLitePsm  ◄────────────────────  🧑\n│          │                    │              │     sellGem         User\n╰──────────╯                    ╰─┬──┬──┬──▲─▲─╯\n                                  │  │  │  │ │\n                                  │  │  │  │ │\n                 frob             │  │  │  │ │\n     ╭────────────────────────────╯  │  │  │ │\n     │                               │  │  │ │\n     │                               │  │  │ │\n     │                               │  │  │ │ fill / trim / chug\n     │                   join / exit │  │  │ ╰──────────────────────  👷\n     │                               │  │  │                        Keeper\n     │                               │  │  │\n╭────▼────╮          ╭───────────╮   │  │  │           ╭─────────────────╮   \n│         │   move   │           │   │  │  │   file    │                 │   \n│   Vat   ◄──────────┤  DaiJoin  ◄───╯  │  ╰───────────│  DssLitePsmMom  │   \n│         │          │           │      │     (halt)   │                 │   \n╰─────────╯          ╰─────┬─────╯      │              ╰─────────────────╯   \n                           │            │\n                           │            │\n               mint / burn │            │\n                           │            │ transfer / transferFrom\n                           │            │\n                      ╭────▼────╮       │\n                      │         │       │\n                      │   Dai   ◄───────╯\n                      │         │\n                      ╰─────────╯\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a name=\"design-and-constraints-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#design-and-constraints-4\"></a>Design and constraints</h3>\n<p>These are the main constraints that guided the design of this module:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Seggregated gem holding: the ability to hold gems in a different address to allow the Maker Protocol to receive yield on deposits.</li>\n<li>Gas efficiency: make swaps as cheap in terms of gas as possible, without sacrificing security and readability.</li>\n<li>Backwards compatibility: the new implementation should not break integrations with the current one.</li>\n<li>Permissioned no-fee swaps: specific actors are allowed to use the PSM for swaps without paying any swap fees.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part of the Dai liquidity available in <code>DssLitePsm</code> is technically unbacked Dai.

The main drawback of this approach is that it can be very gas intensive.</p>\n<p><code>DssLitePsm</code> flips this process on its head and allow bookkeeping to be performed outside the main flows. It sets a predefined amount of Dai that can be permissionlessly pre-minted, so swaps can boil down to mostly 2 token transfers.</p>\n<p>The maximum amount of Dai pre-minted at once is defined by the contract parameter dubbed <code>buf</code>. At any point in time, there might be either missing or excess pre-minted Dai in the contract.</p>\n<p>When Dai is missing, users will be interested in the following functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>function rush() external view returns (uint256)</code>: returns the amount of missing Dai. If it returns a value greater than zero, then a call to <code>fill()</code> described below is possible.</li>\n<li><code>function fill() external returns (uint256)</code>: replenishes LitePSM with pre-minted Dai.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, when there is excess of Dai, there are the following functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>function gush() external view returns (uint256)</code>: returns the amount of Dai in excess. If it returns a value greater than zero, then a call to <code>trim()</code> described below is possible.</li>\n<li><code>function trim() external returns (uint256)</code>: burns the excess pre-minted Dai from LitePSM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also at any point in time, users can check how much in swap fees is accumulated in the contract, using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>function cut() external view returns (uint256)</code>: returns the amount of Dai is currently sittig in the contract as collected swap fees.</li>\n<li><code>function chug() external returns (uint256)</code>: incorporates the outstanding swap fees into the Protocol surplus buffer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To keep gas usage as low as possible, the functions for selling gems allow users to take pre-minted Dai up to the whole Dai balance, even if part of it consists of collected fees. This can tempoprarily prevent Maker Protocol from collecting the fees, until more Dai is pre-minted into LitePSM.</p>\n<p>While all bookkeeping functions are permissionless, there is very little incentive for users to call them. For that reason, there is a set of keepers that will do it on a regular basis.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"swap-functions-return-a-value-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#swap-functions-return-a-value-9\"></a>Swap functions return a value</h3>\n<p>The original <code>DssPsm</code> swap functions <code>buyGem</code> and <code>sellGem</code> do not return anything. On <code>DssLitePsm</code> they return <code>daiIn</code> and <code>daiOut</code>, respectively, to indicate the amount of Dai swapped in or out as the result of the call.</p>\n<p>This is especially useful when swap fees are enabled. Since they are always paid in Dai, the caller can know exactly how much Dai was returned/consumed by the transaction without having to query additional data.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"no-gemjoin-adapter-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#no-gemjoin-adapter-10\"></a>No <code>GemJoin</code> adapter</h3>\n<p>The original <code>DssPsm</code> uses a <code>GemJoin</code> adapter, while <code>DssLitePsm</code> has some of its functionalities baked into the same contract.</p>\n<p>Previously, to be able to query the <code>gem</code> address, callers would be required to chain 2 different calls:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">psm.gemJoin().gem()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now it is possible to query <code>gem</code> directly as well:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">litePsm.gem()\n// Alternatively\nlitePsm.gemJoin().gem()\n</code></pre>\n<p>The latter is possible because <code>litePsm.gemJoin()</code> returns the address of the contract itself (<code>address(this)</code>).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"no-emergency-shutdown-support-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#no-emergency-shutdown-support-11\"></a>No Emergency Shutdown support</h3>\n<p>Linked to the point above, <code>DssPsm</code>’s <code>GemJoin</code> has its own <code>live</code> parameter, which can be set to <code>0</code> during Emergency Shutdown. To keep the interface compatibility, <code>DssLitePsm</code> implements a <code>live</code> getter which can be called like:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">litePsm.live()\n// Alternatively\nlitePsm.gemJoin().live()\n</code></pre>\n<p>It returns the value of <code>vat.live</code>, which is expected to be <code>1</code> for the time being, since the Emergency Shutdown threshold will be increased significantly when on-boarding LitePSM.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"token-balances-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#token-balances-12\"></a>Token balances</h3>\n<p>To query the original PSM <code>gem</code> balance, the user needs to call:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">gem.balanceOf(psm.gemJoin())\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is no need to query the Dai balance, since it is minted on-demand into the specified user address.</p>\n<p>For LitePSM, the balance is held in the <code>pocket</code> address and there might be pre-minted Dai sitting in the <code>DssLitePsm</code> contract itself:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">// Gem balance of LitePSM\ngem.balanceOf(litePsm.pocket())\n// Pre-minted Dai balance of LitePSM\ndai.balanceOf(litePsm)\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a name=\"known-limitations-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#known-limitations-13\"></a>Known Limitations</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-potential-front-running-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-1-potential-front-running-14\"></a>1. Potential Front-Running</h3>\n<p><code>DssLitePsm</code> relies on pre-minted Dai. It is designed to keep a fixed-sized amount (<code>buf</code>) of it available most of the time.  However, when users call <code>buyGem</code>, the amount of Dai available will be temporarily larger than <code>buf</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario A:</strong> a user might observe the outstanding amount of Dai and wish to call <code>sellGem</code> to receive the total of Dai in return. In that scenario, there is a possibility of a transaction calling any of the permissionless bookkeeping functions to front-run them, causing the swap to fail, as the Dai liquidity would be lower than the required amount.</p>\n<p>The scenario A above is not possible with the current PSM implementation because each swap is “self-balancing”, so no off-band bookkeeping is required.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario B:</strong> a large swap might front-run another one, even if unintentionally. Imagine there is <code>10M</code> Dai outstanding in <code>DssLitePsm</code>. If Alice – who wants to swap <code>8M</code> – and Bob – who wants to swap <code>3M</code> – submit their transactions at the same time, only the first one will be executed.</p>\n<p>The scenario B above is not possible with the current PSM implementation because <code>sellGem</code> is able to mint Dai on-the-fly to fulfill the swap, given that there is enough room in the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>Notice how the same issue happens in <code>buyGem</code>, however the amount of <code>gem</code> deposited into <code>DssLitePsm</code> is only bounded by the debt ceiling, while the amount of <code>Dai</code> will tend to gravitate towards <code>buf</code>.</p>\n<p>The consequence is that anyone willing to call <code>sellGem</code> with a value larger than <code>buf</code> should take care of potential front-running transactions by bundling it with an optional liquidity increase (<code>fill</code>).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-no-slippage-protection-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-2-no-slippage-protection-15\"></a>2. No Slippage Protection</h3>\n<p>Swaps in <code>DssLitePsm</code> are generally not subject to slippage. The only exception is when there is a MakerDAO Governance proposal to increase the swapping fees <code>tin</code> and/or <code>tout</code>.

As of May 2024, Steakhouse <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/harbor-trade-credit-workout-process/24367\">has requested funding for legal expenses</a> from the DAO to assist Harbor Trade in the recovery as it begins litigation in Germany.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"consolfreight-rwa-003-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#consolfreight-rwa-003-10\"></a>ConsolFreight (RWA-003)</h2>\n<p>The ConsolFreight portfolio currently consists of delinquent and defaulted assets. One delinquent asset remains with a balance of $196k alongside two default assets (Hanhwa) totaling approximately $1.9mm. These $2.1M in assets support 1.9M (market value) in Drop tokens, of which $1.7M belong to Maker’s vault.</p>\n<p>The legal process for the defaulted loans (Hanhwa) is still ongoing. In late May, ConsolFreight provided an update on the recovery process:</p>\n<p><em>We remain optimistic that the Court will grant our request for the Liquidator and Directed to provide many, if not most, of the documents we have sought through our subpoenas and preliminary discovery application. A separate application for preliminary discovery has been filed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Regarding our argument on “actual or apparent possession” of the goods that the Liquidator sold upon his appointment, we faced some challenges. While we had a strong enough argument to seek preliminary discovery, the Buyer Trade Finance Agreement (BTFA) does not entirely circumvent the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR) requirements in Australia. The PPSR ensures transparency regarding who has a security interest in goods through registration or possession.</em></p>\n<p><em>Despite these challenges, there is still potential for claims against the Liquidator if the documents reveal that he was aware of any wrongdoing by Hanhwa concerning our goods. Similarly, we may have claims against Directed if it is shown that they were aware of the BTFA when acquiring the goods before liquidation.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Court has not yet delivered a judgment, which is an unusual delay. The delay could indicate that the Registrar is carefully considering which documents should be provided, but it is difficult to determine the exact cause. The Registrar may simply have a heavy workload.</em></p>\n<p><em>With Hanhwa director now bankrupted and out of the picture, our straightforward claim has become more complex. Our chances of success against the Liquidator and Directed will largely depend on the Registrar’s decision on our preliminary discovery application and the documents produced. Once we have access to these documents, we will be able to provide a more informed opinion.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your continued patience and support. We will keep you informed of any further developments.</em></p>\n<p>As a reminder, on August 24th of 2023, Steakhouse and ConsolFreight <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/consolfreight-rwa-003-cf4-drop-default/21745\">alerted</a> MakerDAO that the pools largest position, Hanhwa, was expected to default. The balance of the affected position is roughly 1.8mm out of the 2.5mm portfolio (as of October 2023 month-end). There is not currently a good estimate for expected recovery, but it is very possible the Drop token is impacted. Please note that the value of the loans in Centrifuge (and in the above dashboard) have not been written down.</p>\n<p>MakerDAO has reduced the debt ceiling to zero as part of its offboarding of Legacy RWAs</p>\n<h4><a name=\"legal-disclaimer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#legal-disclaimer-11\"></a>Legal disclaimer</h4>\n<h6><a name=\"this-communication-is-provided-for-information-purposes-only-this-communication-has-been-prepared-based-upon-information-including-market-prices-data-and-other-information-from-sources-believed-to-be-reliable-but-such-information-has-not-independently-been-verified-and-this-communication-makes-no-representations-about-the-enduring-accuracy-of-the-information-or-its-appropriateness-for-a-given-situation-this-content-is-provided-for-informational-purposes-only-and-should-not-be-relied-upon-as-legal-business-investment-financial-or-tax-advice-you-should-consult-your-own-advisers-as-to-those-matters-references-to-any-digital-assets-and-the-use-of-finance-related-terminology-are-for-illustrative-purposes-only-and-do-not-constitute-any-recommendation-for-any-action-or-an-offer-to-provide-investment-financial-or-other-advisory-services-this-content-is-not-directed-at-nor-intended-for-use-by-the-makerdao-community-makerdao-and-may-not-under-any-circumstances-be-relied-upon-when-making-a-decision-to-purchase-any-digital-asset-referenced-herein-the-digital-assets-referenced-herein-currently-face-an-uncertain-regulatory-landscape-in-not-only-the-united-states-but-also-in-many-foreign-jurisdictions-including-but-not-limited-to-the-united-kingdom-european-union-singapore-korea-japan-and-china-the-legal-and-regulatory-risks-inherent-in-referenced-digital-assets-are-not-the-subject-of-this-content-for-guidance-regarding-the-possibility-of-said-risks-one-should-consult-with-his-or-her-own-appropriate-legal-andor-regulatory-counsel-charts-and-graphs-provided-within-are-for-informational-purposes-solely-and-should-not-be-relied-upon-when-making-any-decision-the-content-speaks-only-as-of-the-date-indicated-any-projections-estimates-forecasts-targets-prospects-andor-opinions-expressed-in-these-materials-are-subject-to-change-without-notice-and-may-differ-or-be-contrary-to-opinions-expressed-by-others-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#this-communication-is-provided-for-information-purposes-only-this-communication-has-been-prepared-based-upon-information-including-market-prices-data-and-other-information-from-sources-believed-to-be-reliable-but-such-information-has-not-independently-been-verified-and-this-communication-makes-no-representations-about-the-enduring-accuracy-of-the-information-or-its-appropriateness-for-a-given-situation-this-content-is-provided-for-informational-purposes-only-and-should-not-be-relied-upon-as-legal-business-investment-financial-or-tax-advice-you-should-consult-your-own-advisers-as-to-those-matters-references-to-any-digital-assets-and-the-use-of-finance-related-terminology-are-for-illustrative-purposes-only-and-do-not-constitute-any-recommendation-for-any-action-or-an-offer-to-provide-investment-financial-or-other-advisory-services-this-content-is-not-directed-at-nor-intended-for-use-by-the-makerdao-community-makerdao-and-may-not-under-any-circumstances-be-relied-upon-when-making-a-decision-to-purchase-any-digital-asset-referenced-herein-the-digital-assets-referenced-herein-currently-face-an-uncertain-regulatory-landscape-in-not-only-the-united-states-but-also-in-many-foreign-jurisdictions-including-but-not-limited-to-the-united-kingdom-european-union-singapore-korea-japan-and-china-the-legal-and-regulatory-risks-inherent-in-referenced-digital-assets-are-not-the-subject-of-this-content-for-guidance-regarding-the-possibility-of-said-risks-one-should-consult-with-his-or-her-own-appropriate-legal-andor-regulatory-counsel-charts-and-graphs-provided-within-are-for-informational-purposes-solely-and-should-not-be-relied-upon-when-making-any-decision-the-content-speaks-only-as-of-the-date-indicated-any-projections-estimates-forecasts-targets-prospects-andor-opinions-expressed-in-these-materials-are-subject-to-change-without-notice-and-may-differ-or-be-contrary-to-opinions-expressed-by-others-12\"></a><em>This communication is provided for information purposes only.

As SES and later Powerhouse, we have focused on providing operational support to MakerDAO, aligning with stakeholders to identify key needs and building open-source software tools to expedite and automate the process.</p>\n<p>Since the passage of the Endgame, Powerhouse is focused on supporting the launch season and building new open-source operational tools for MakerDAO to maintain decentralization while incorporating new governance AI tooling. Powerhouse is developing this Universal DAO Toolkit to be used by all DAOs, but right now our focus is on supporting MakerDAO. This post aims to highlight recent work for MakerDAO and explain how the infrastructure used to build tools for MakerDAO allows for rapid development of additional operational and governance applications. Here’s an outline of what’s to come:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RWA Reporting Tool</li>\n<li>Updated Maker expenses dashboard through Fusion</li>\n<li>Atlas Editor and Governance AI Tools (GAIT)</li>\n<li>Strengths of Using Powerhouse’s Document Models</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"rwa-reporting-tool-for-ba-labs-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#rwa-reporting-tool-for-ba-labs-2\"></a>RWA Reporting Tool for BA Labs</h2>\n<p>As part of the upcoming launch season, BA Labs is building a new risk dashboard.

The RWA Reporting provides this transparency through an end-to-end flow that captures structured data. Every time Arrangers update RWA information, <em>Connect</em> records each edit and ties it to an Ethereum signer. This creates a full and detailed audit history that anybody can use to view and verify the validity of the transactions. The document also has edit permissions set, such that only addresses designated by MakerDAO governance can make changes to a particular RWA document. This identity authentication happens through the <em>Renown</em> app using an Ethereum address. Renown assigns a decentralized identifier (DID) with verifiable credentials that control access to the document through decentralized infrastructure. Powerhouse worked closely with Ceramic to build this feature.</p>\n<p>Powerhouse provided a successful product demo to <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f-h8mPCUw4u5gCFn-TQcTw_XIDN7Ayvs/view\">key stakeholders earlier this month</a>. Arrangers can engage in real-time collaboration in entering data in <em>Connect</em> through Powerhouse’s synchronization protocol. For BA Labs, they can access all of RWA data through <em>Connect</em> or through <em>Switchboard</em>, which provides a GraphQL interface for working with large sets of data.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/7/3740166c038414e5694f8e66844c693b69d60cb4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7SLzcYYoLE3y1QkLhzmCC4QSjEE.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Figure 2: An example of a RWA portfolio report on Connect\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/7/3740166c038414e5694f8e66844c693b69d60cb4_2_690x441.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 2: An example of a RWA portfolio report on Connect\" data-base62-sha1=\"7SLzcYYoLE3y1QkLhzmCC4QSjEE\" width=\"690\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/7/3740166c038414e5694f8e66844c693b69d60cb4_2_690x441.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/7/3740166c038414e5694f8e66844c693b69d60cb4_2_1035x661.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/7/3740166c038414e5694f8e66844c693b69d60cb4_2_1380x882.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F5F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/7/b7a01854b615d08f4f1c23ec6138d78856996f3d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qcqnvprynWCqHyPARNkPpws7GdD.png?dl=1\" title=\"Figure 3: RWA Portfolio Report through Switchboard\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/7/b7a01854b615d08f4f1c23ec6138d78856996f3d_2_690x344.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: RWA Portfolio Report through Switchboard\" data-base62-sha1=\"qcqnvprynWCqHyPARNkPpws7GdD\" width=\"690\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/7/b7a01854b615d08f4f1c23ec6138d78856996f3d_2_690x344.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/7/b7a01854b615d08f4f1c23ec6138d78856996f3d_2_1035x516.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/7/b7a01854b615d08f4f1c23ec6138d78856996f3d_2_1380x688.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"202C35\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In addition to viewing the RWA information, Powerhouse’s events-based architecture also enables a detailed revision history of what changes and who made them to the document.

This data structure undergirds Powerhouse’s core products, making it seamlessly integrated. The RWA Reporting Tool and soon the Atlas Editor are just the first tools that could be built using this architecture. Any business process can be built on top of this architecture, from grants programs to payroll to proposal collaboration.</p>\n<p>Powerhouse’s architecture comes with five strengths:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decentralization and Web 3</strong> - identity and reputation are achieved through Ethereum addresses, while the storage adapters enable any decentralized data storage protocol to plug directly into Powerhouse.</li>\n<li><strong>Massive Scalability</strong> - Powerhouse uses the same design that enables Web2 scalability with built-in micro-services compatibility (SaaS), event-sourcing and utilizes a CQRS design pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>State of the Art UX Practices</strong> - Document model reducers enable user interaction modeling beyond state schemas and a Flux-like design pattern saves front-end developers time with easy integration with React.js.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Collaboration Primitives</strong> - Powerhouse achieves the best of Google Docs and Github with the centralization with document commit histories with branching and merging similar to git, and a distributed data ownership structure with real-time collaboration.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduction of cost and shorter time-to-market</strong> - Powerhouse is open-source and optimized for automation and AI. Reusable components allow developers to build applications quickly, while our Model-Driven Development approach enables low-code development.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These strengths will allow developers to build customized applications to streamline operations across DAOs and other open organizations.

In this post I will describe several related changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new feature: <strong>NewGovToken Activation</strong></li>\n<li>Changes to LockStaking, including renaming it to <strong>Sealed Activation</strong></li>\n<li>Renaming of SPK Staking to <strong>SPK Activation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below represents my current thinking about the topic and the final design will be subject to the community’s feedback and approval.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"new-feature-newgovtoken-activation-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#new-feature-newgovtoken-activation-1\"></a>New Feature: NewGovToken Activation</h1>\n<p>Activation is a new feature that will be available to NewGovToken holders. It is designed to incentivize governance participation in the long term among NewGovToken holders who do not wish to lock up their tokens long term with Sealed Activation (formerly LockStaking).</p>\n<p>NewGovToken holders can Activate or Deactivate their NewGovToken at any time, with no restrictions, cost, or additional risk. Later on it will be possible to delegate while Activating, with additional incentives to reward governance participation.</p>\n<p>When NewGovToken is Activated, the user chooses a reward to receive. The rewards available will be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10% of total Protocol Stablecoin Surplus</li>\n<li>15% of the Token Reward supply for each SubDAO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NewGovToken Activation will become available at Spark launch.</p>\n<p>At first only SPK rewards will be supported for users who Activate (at a rate of 150 million SPK per year distributed across all Activated NewGovToken). Some time after Spark launch, Protocol Stablecoin Surplus will become available, and other SubDAO tokens will be available as Activation Rewards as soon as they launch.</p>\n<p>In addition to incentivizing governance participation in the long term, NewGovToken Activation will also act as a useful primitive that can power restaking mechanisms built on top of NewGovToken. Restaking protocols will be able to stack the native Activation Rewards with their own Restaking rewards.</p>\n<p>NewGovToken Activation will not be available to US-based and VPN users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"newgovtoken-sealed-activation-formerly-known-as-lockstaking-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#newgovtoken-sealed-activation-formerly-known-as-lockstaking-2\"></a>NewGovToken Sealed Activation (formerly known as LockStaking)</h1>\n<p>LockStaking is being renamed to Sealed Activation, and some of its parameters have changed.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation is designed to incentivize participants to delegate their NewGovToken and MKR and get additional skin in the game, by Sealing the tokens behind an Exit Fee.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation will launch shortly after the launch of NewStable, NewGovToken, and the new Endgame app.</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation is available both to NewGovToken and MKR holders, and provides Activation Rewards. It is possible to delegate while Sealed. When Unsealing, there is an Exit Fee.</p>\n<p>When NewGovToken is Sealed, the user chooses a reward to receive. The rewards available will be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>25% of total Protocol Stablecoin Surplus</li>\n<li>15% of the Token Reward supply emissions for each SubDAO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Sealed Activation launches, only 25% of the Protocol Stablecoin Surplus will be available as an Activation Reward, but SPK Token Reward will become available as an additional choice soon as Spark launches (at a rate of 150 million SPK tokens per year distributed across all Sealed NewGovToken and MKR).</p>\n<p>Sealed Activation has an Exit Fee that is paid on the Sealed principal when the user Unseals. The Exit Fee starts at 5% at the moment Sealed Activation launches, and then increases by 1% every 6 months until it reaches its long term value of 15%. Exit Fee increases are applied retroactively. The Exit Fee is set low initially to encourage a lot of early participation.</p>\n<p>NewGovToken Sealed Activation will not be available to US-based and VPN users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"spk-activation-formerly-known-as-spk-staking-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#spk-activation-formerly-known-as-spk-staking-3\"></a>SPK Activation (Formerly known as SPK Staking)</h1>\n<p>When the Spark SubDAO launches SPK will have the SPK Activation feature available from launch (previously known as SPK Staking).</p>\n<p>Just like NewGovToken Activation, SPK holders can Activate or Deactivate their SPK at any time, with no restrictions, cost, or additional risk. Later on it will be possible to vote while Activating, and there will be additional incentives to reward governance participation.</p>\n<p>When SPK is Activated, the user receives NewGovToken Rewards. The total rewards are 80 million NewGovToken per year distributed across all Activated SPK.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"additional-changes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#additional-changes-4\"></a>Additional changes</h1>\n<p>I will follow up with another post that will detail more changes, both feature changes and terminology changes, which I plan to put into the next MIP edit for community feedback and approval.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/newgovtoken-activation-new-feature-and-other-changes/24688\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/newgovtoken-activation-new-feature-and-other-changes/24688","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 19:08:59 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24688"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/newgovtoken-activation-new-feature-and-other-changes/24688.rss","#text":"NewGovToken Activation: new feature and other changes"},"filter":false},{"title":"Capital Transparency: Endgame Operational Expenses Enabled by the Atlas","dc:creator":"ecosystem-team","category":"Maker Core","description":"<p>The Ecosystem team is providing an update on our progress toward expense transparency, specifically building on the former <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/capital-transparency-2023-overview-of-the-transition-to-endgame/23438\">Capital Transparency: 2023 Overview of the Transition to Endgame</a>.</p>\n<p>In the sections below, we provide an overview of expenses from <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/preparing-to-decentralize-the-launch-project-after-launch-season/24193\">May 2023</a> through July 7, 2024.

Here is a quick overview of EtherMail’s security and important business context to allow one to assess the longevity EtherMail may have.</p>\n<p>Encryption:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emails sent between EtherMail users: Always end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that only the sender and recipient can read the messages.</li>\n<li>Emails from EtherMail users to non-EtherMail users: Encrypted with TLS if the non-EtherMail mail server supports it. While this provides encryption in transit, it is not end-to-end encrypted, meaning providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail can read these messages and hand them over if needed.</li>\n<li>Emails from non-EtherMail users to EtherMail users: Unless PGP is used, the email message is encrypted in transit using TLS and stored on EtherMail’s servers with zero-access encryption. However, it is not end-to-end encrypted and might be accessible to the sender’s email service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Funding:</p>\n<p>EtherMail has secured $7.3M in funding over two rounds from notable investors, including Tim Draper, Draper Associates, MS&amp;AD Ventures, Fabric Ventures, Greenfield, Rene Reinsberg, and w3.fund. This information is sourced from Crunchbase and confirmed in their EMT token launch article.</p>\n<p>Business Model:</p>\n<p>EtherMail recently launched the EMT token, introducing “Consensual Marketing.” In this model, users opt-in to receive promotional content and are compensated with EMT tokens for their engagement. The utility of EMT includes access to premium features and market buybacks equating 50% of all Consensual Marketing advertising revenue.</p>\n<p>For more details, you can read the article on the EMT token here (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@ethermail_io/launching-emt-the-worlds-first-email-token-e2378336de18#:~:text=Consensual%20Marketing%3A%20EtherMail%20introduces%20a,EMT%20tokens%20for%20their%20engagement\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Launching $EMT: The World’s First Email Token | by EtherMail | Jun, 2024 | Medium</a>).</p>\n<p>Best Practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a security precaution, do not use an address already used for handling financial transactions or storing funds for EtherMail. This minimizes the risk of financial loss.</li>\n<li>Inform your contacts about the security practices and limitations of using different email services. Encourage them to adopt secure email practices and consider using EtherMail for secure communications.</li>\n<li>For communications that must extend outside the EtherMail network, using PGP encryption can provide an additional layer of security. Both senders and recipients should be familiar with setting up and using PGP to ensure their messages are protected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This overview should help Alignment Conservers and those committed to high OpSec standards understand EtherMail’s potential as a secure and innovative email solution.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ethermail-email-solution-with-ethereum-sign-in/24670\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ethermail-email-solution-with-ethereum-sign-in/24670","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 14:52:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24670"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/ethermail-email-solution-with-ethereum-sign-in/24670.rss","#text":"EtherMail: Email Solution with Ethereum Sign In"},"filter":false},{"title":"Analysis and Summary of Recent Liquidations in the MakerDAO and SparkLend Ecosystems","dc:creator":"Mezdalug","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In the wake of recent market turbulence, the DeFi ecosystem has experienced liquidation events affecting positions across both the MakerDAO Core and SparkLend lending engines. This report will analyze the liquidations from 2 July 2024 to 8 July 2024, highlighting affected vaults, collateral types, and the financial implications in both DAI repayment and collateral liquidation. By understanding these market dynamics, we aim to underline the DeFi sector’s resilience and areas for potential enhancement.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"market-conditions-leading-to-liquidations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#market-conditions-leading-to-liquidations-2\"></a>Market Conditions Leading to Liquidations</h1>\n<p>There had been a significant bearish movement in the BTC and ETH prices in the first week of July. The BTC price plummeted by ~16% from 1 July to 5 July. Similarly, the price of ETH has decreased by ~20% in the same period - yet both assets have gained some value since. The recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market was, among others, also instigated by the large-scale movement of assets by Mt Gox, which started to repay users, triggering a significant supply shock. This had the effect on Thursday when its BTC movement (together with other market conditions) moved the price on Thursday evening, 4 July, to Friday morning, 5 July, ~8.8% lower.</p>\n<p>With previous bearish pressure on BTC and ETH prices, this rapid asset devaluation cascaded through the DeFi space, prompting a series of liquidations.</p>\n<p>For why exactly the Mt Gox movement had such an effect, refer to the following sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/303586/mt-gox-moves-nearly-47229-btc-ahead-of-9-billion-payout\">Mt Gox moves nearly 47,229 BTC</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/05/mt-gox-begins-repaying-bitcoin-to-creditors-a-decade-on-from-collapse.html\">Mt.

Although the total number of liquidations is only seven, the value of those liquidations is far from negligible.

Liquidators repaid $3.26M of debt, accounting for a 13% penalty fee, resulting in a $423K penalty collected by Maker protocol. While the movement of MtGox had an effect on the liquidations happening on 5 July, the liquidation on 3 July had to be due to some other reasons for not adjusting the position to the bearish market conditions. The recent liquidation data suggests the critical need for maintaining appropriate collateralization ratios in such volatile conditions.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"sparklend-liquidations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#sparklend-liquidations-4\"></a>SparkLend Liquidations</h1>\n<p>Similarly, SparkLend also faced the brunt of this market crash, resulting in numerous forced liquidations of various borrower positions. A lot more liquidations have been executed here, however the total value is significantly lower compared to Maker. While the Maker has seen the liquidations also before the MtGox effect, the SparkLend had more liquidation in number, but the majority of positions were very small, resulting in $892.7K collateral being liquidated and $853.4K debt being repaid.</p>\n<p>The total number of liquidations on Spark was 30, the vast majority on 5 July due to the explained market effect. There were 12 liquidations cumulatively on 6, 7, and 8 July; however, these positions were minimal in value, while 2 liquidations happened on 4 July, also extremely small.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/raFIAhmoosoTA3NtyJbD5avwPca.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e_2_690x510.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"raFIAhmoosoTA3NtyJbD5avwPca\" width=\"690\" height=\"510\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e_2_690x510.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e_2_1035x765.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/e/be6f8d6470eccca371e22cabfb5914b112eb7f2e.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"212027\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://spark.blockanalitica.com/v1/ethereum/liquidations/?days_ago=7\">Block Analitica Spark Liquidations</a></p>\n<p>The most liquidated collateral was WETH, which represented 92.43% ($661K) of all the collateral; the rest was WSTETH with 4.09% ($29K), WBTC with 3.21% ($23K), and sDAI with 0.27% ($2K).

We also initiate phase 1 of a three-step migration process intended to gradually migrate USDC from <code>USDC-PSM-A</code> and <code>RWA014-A</code>, to <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>. The first migration phase is estimated to last for 4 weeks, but can be changed depending on how many users and integrations managed to migrate, which will be communicated on this forum via new parameter proposal recommendation. To learn more about the proposed migration process and its respective phases, refer to <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/litepsm-lite-psm-usdc-a-introduction-and-overview/24512\">LitePSM (LITE-PSM-USDC-A): Introduction and Overview</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that the recommended parameter values covered in this post are intended to change as the <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code> migration initiative reaches phase 2, and then again, as we reach phase 3. <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> will provide two additional forum posts with recommended parameter changes for the remaining steps of the migration process.</p>\n<p>As we explain in the LitePSM introduction post, the LitePSM contract had already been deployed at <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xf6e72Db5454dd049d0788e411b06CfAF16853042\">0xf6e72Db5454dd049d0788e411b06CfAF16853042</a>, the upcoming spell will finalize all required parameter configurations and execute the initial migration of reserves from PSM-USDC-A to LitePSM.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-parameters-for-phase-1-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposed-parameters-for-phase-1-3\"></a>Proposed Parameters for Phase 1</h1>\n<p>BA Labs recommends the Stability Facilitator to poll the following parameter changes and deployments in next available cycle and include them in the next available executive vote assuming positive poll outcome:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploy <code>PSM_MOM</code> GSM Delay Exception</li>\n<li>Migrate initial USDC (20M) reserves from PSM-USDC-A to LitePSM with a script executed in the spell, while leaving at least 200M USDC reserves in PSM-USDC-A</li>\n<li>The current DC-IAM available DAI liquidity is distributed between the two PSMs\n<ul>\n<li><code>PSM-USDC-A</code>\n<ul>\n<li><code>tin</code> &amp; <code>tout</code>: 0 (remains unchanged)</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>line</code> (max DC): 10B (remains unchanged)</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>gap</code>: Decrease for 20M from 400M to 380M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>ttl</code>: 12h (remains unchanged)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>\n<ul>\n<li><code>tin</code> &amp; <code>tout</code>: Set to 0</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>line</code> (max DC): Set to 50M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>gap</code>: Set to 20M</li>\n<li>DC-IAM <code>ttl</code>: Set to 12h</li>\n<li><code>buf</code>: Set to 20M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>GSM Delay</code>: Decrease by 14h, from 30h to 16h</li>\n<li><code>ESM</code> (Emergency Shutdown Module) minimum threshold: Increase for 150k from 150k to 300k</li>\n<li>Deploy the keeper network job for calling permissionless LitePSM functions</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"keeper-network-threshold-parameters-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#keeper-network-threshold-parameters-4\"></a>Keeper Network Threshold Parameters</h1>\n<p>This group of parameters is specific to when the keeper network job is deployed and configured to call certain functions related to LitePSM buf.</p>\n<p>These are permissionless functions, but we still want to call them regularly in order to maintain a certain amount of DAI in the buf and transfers accumulated fees to the surplus buffer.</p>\n<p>Fill function mints additional DAI to the buf after a defined threshold had been reached up to the limit. Trim function burns DAI from the buf after a defined threshold had been reached down to the limit. The chug function transfers accumulated fees from the LitePSM to the surplus buffer, note that fees will not be activated for a considerable amount of time and are not planned as part of any migration phase.</p>\n<p>The keeper network job thresholds configuration will likely change in latter migration phases as liquidity and available DAI in buf increases, in the initial phase they are set relatively close to the buf in order to achieve good experience for transactors and integrators.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>fill</code>: Set threshold at 15M DAI</li>\n<li><code>trim</code>: Set threshold at 30M DAI</li>\n<li><code>chug</code>: Set threshold at 300k DAI</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"evaluation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#evaluation-5\"></a>Evaluation</h1>\n<p>The main goal of phase 1 is to have an initial low exposure period that will provide integrators with sufficient time to familiarize themselves with the LitePSM and to start migrating their solutions from PSM-USDC-A to LITE-PSM-USDC-A. The estimated duration of phase 1 is approximately 4 weeks. However, this duration may change depending on multiple factors, including (i) integrations, (ii) legal and technical aspects, (iii) the Maker governance process, and more.</p>\n<p>Below, we provide some additional context for the proposed parameter values for phase 1.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"deploy-psm_mom-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#deploy-psm_mom-6\"></a>Deploy PSM_MOM</h2>\n<p>Due to the fact that the LitePSM will have pre-minted DAI in the <code>buf</code>, the normal <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#10-2-3-debt-ceiling-breaker\">LINE_MOM</a> contract is not sufficient for temporarily disabling <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>. Instead, a new module referred to as <code>PSM_MOM</code> will be deployed. The PSM_MOM will be able to disable the LitePSM contracts by temporarily halting swaps.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"dc-iam-parameters-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dc-iam-parameters-7\"></a>DC-IAM Parameters</h2>\n<p><a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> believes that 20 million USDC serves as an adequate migration amount for the initial testing period. The 20 million USDC will be migrated from <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> to <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code> using a script in the determined Executive Spell.</p>\n<p>In order to counterbalance the increased exposure resulting from a gap and buf value of 20M respectively, we recommend decreasing the gap of <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> by 20M, from 400M to 380M. All other <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> parameters will remain unchanged for phase 1.</p>\n<p>For <code>LITE-PSM-USDC-A</code>, we recommend setting <code>tin</code> &amp; <code>tout</code> to 0, and the <code>ttl</code> to 12h in order to minimize unnecessary changes during the migration process and to reproduce a similar user experience as <code>PSM-USDC-A</code> and finally to achieve same available DAI liquidity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"gsm-delay-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#gsm-delay-8\"></a>GSM Delay</h2>\n<p>During phase 1 of the migration plan, <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/ba-labs\">@BA-Labs</a> believes that it is prudent to apply a lower GSM Delay in case any swift actions or parameter changes become necessary. We believe that a 16h GSM delay is a good compromise solution between being able to react quickly, while still being able to mitigate any potential malicious spells.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"esm-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#esm-9\"></a>ESM</h2>\n<p>The Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) will be increased, as the long-term plan is to remove this feature from the system and the LitePSM module is not supported by the ESM. There is still some value of maintaining the module until the full deployment of the Allocation System as part of the Endgame, but the threshold should be increased in order to prevent hostile activation when the module should not be used.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-scope-language-changes-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#proposed-scope-language-changes-10\"></a>Proposed Scope Language Changes</h1>\n<p>We will provide a more comprehensive language change edit where we define PSM_MOM, the LitePSM, and relevant parameters, in a future proposal. For the time being, the only relevant parameter value that needs to be changed is <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#10-1-1a\">10.1.1A</a> in the <a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#0-the-governance-scope\">Governance Scope</a>.

Below is an update from 6s Capital:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We remain in continual compliance with the revolver’s covenants, and each of the underlying projects remaining in the portfolio is current with rent payments. These underlying projects are, or will shortly be put, on the market for divestiture. As each project is divested, closing funds will be utilized to pay down the revolver directly, to clear the lien.</p>\n<p>6s would again like to express our appreciation and our thanks to the community for the faith they put in us and our plan to deploy capital into senior secured loans.

Cohort Analysis</h1>\n<p>In the analysis we are presenting, we’ve organized wallets into categories based on the month they first used the protocol. Each category is called a “cohort month.” For example, all the wallets that first used the protocol in January are in the January cohort, those that first used the protocol in February are in the February cohort, etc. We measure how long each wallet has been active with a “Cohort tenure” number. This number is just the number of months since the wallet joined its cohort. So, if a wallet’s Cohort tenure is 1, it means it’s the wallet’s first month since joining; if it’s 2, it’s the second month, and so on.</p>\n<p>One important note is that for our analysis, we’ve put all wallets that joined from May 2023 to January 2024 into a single group, which we’re calling the January Cohort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"healthy-growth-patterns-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#healthy-growth-patterns-3\"></a>Healthy growth patterns</h2>\n<p>After reaching the peak of supplied amounts in February 2024 (~$4.1B), the total supply fell until April, reaching a new low of ~$2.8B (Chart 1). The main reason the total supply has been dropping is the down-market we have been witnessing, with BTC price falling by ~14% from its peak and ETH falling by ~20% from its peak. However, since then, we have seen a new supply coming in May and June. While the bullish sentiment has primarily driven the growth in May (ETH Price increased by ~35%); the growth in June was driven by a new supply coming into a protocol. There had been ~$800M of new supply coming in from the new wallets. The pattern is very similar for total borrows (Chart 4), which reached their low in April 2024, increased in May, and reached new highs in June 2024 (~$1.75B).</p>\n<p>While this metric alone is not enough to assess the protocol’s overall growth, the remaining ones give a clearer picture of SparkLend’s status. Since January 2024, the new cohorts have been supplying less as a percentage of total supplies (Chart 2). However, this changed in June 2024, as new entrants supplied 19.8% of the total supply in the protocol. The lower growth during the previous months has been due to two main factors: (i) the positive retention patterns of the May-January cohort and (ii) the decreasing number of new wallets opening positions on SparkLend (Chart 7). Even though the number of new wallets has been the lowest in the analyzing period, these wallets hold a lot of supply. Up to date, supplied and borrowed amounts have been dropping in the range of 10% - 50% for new cohorts (Charts 3 and 6), except for the April cohort, which exhibited a growth in supply and borrowing. Except for the March and May cohorts, the large wallets’ dominance per cohort tenure has been extremely high for each individual cohort (Chart 8). It shows that even though supply increased by $800M in June, 76% of this supply is due to only five big wallets that joined the protocol.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"supplied-and-borrowed-amounts-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#supplied-and-borrowed-amounts-4\"></a>Supplied and borrowed amounts</h2>\n<p>Regarding total amounts supplied in June 2024, $801M (or 19.8%) came from the June cohort, followed by the February (12.4%) and the March (6.3%), with respectively $502M and $253M. Except for the April cohort (+34%), all other cohorts’ supplied amounts have been dropping, such as March (-47%), February (-37%), January (-15%), and May (-12%).</p>\n<p>The largest cohorts by amount supplied are the same cohorts dominating borrowing, with June borrowing $389M (22.2%), March borrowing $141M (8.1%), and February borrowing $125M (7.1%). The February and March cohorts dropped the most, down 55% and 43%, respectively, since they started using SparkLend.</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the cohorts.</p>\n\nChart 1.

Segmentation Analysis</h1>\n<p>The segmentation analysis assessed the types of positions and strategies SparkLend users are deploying. For a detailed understanding of how these were calculated, please refer to the previously conducted Segmentation Analysis. Compared to the previous analyses, this time we have added new positions that segment LRT users. To summarize briefly, here are the identified segments:</p>\n\nIdentified Segments <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h2><a name=\"the-sparklend-sentiment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#the-sparklend-sentiment-6\"></a>The SparkLend Sentiment</h2>\n<p>In the last analysis, we used individual wallet positions to assess the sentiment of SparkLend users towards the crypto market. It is very interesting to note that most wallets are still exhibiting bullish behavior, with the largest positions being <code>Long ETH LST</code> ($1.77B) and <code>Long Type 1</code> ($1.07B), together accounting for ~70% of the total supply in June (Charts 9 and 10). The third-largest position is the <code>Recursive ETH LST</code> (~$735M), roughly ~18% of the total supply. It is also worth noting that the wallets in the highest supply bucket (&gt;$100M) all have long positions, deployed only in three segments mentioned before (<code>Recursive ETH LST</code>, <code>Long Type 1</code>, and <code>Long ETH LST</code>) (Chart 12).</p>\n<p>Short positions are practically non-existent in relative terms compared to long ones. That tells us that the participants have a bullish outlook for the future. Short positions are currently ~0.3% of total supply, which has decreased from the previous month (~0.4%) and has dramatically dropped from its peak in January 2024 (~2.9%).</p>\n<p>The wallet count per position strategy (Chart 11) highlights a high predominance of <code>Long Type 1</code> (516) users, followed by <code>Long ETH LST</code> (191) and <code>Diversified Borrowers</code> (143). Only 12 wallets display strictly short strategies. The large wallets dominate in strategies <code>Long LRT</code>, <code>Short Type 1</code>, and <code>Supply Only Stablecoins</code> (Chart 14). This is mainly due to a low number of wallets employing these strategies.</p>\n<p>A comparison between the current state of health rates (Chart 16) and the previous analysis shows that Recursive ETH LST has lower debt-weighted health rates (up from 1.02 on 1 May to 1.09 on 1 July). Short strategies also have a higher health rate (1.52 vs. 1.81), the same as does Long ETH LST (2.15 vs. 2.33).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"behavioral-analysis-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#behavioral-analysis-7\"></a>Behavioral analysis</h2>\n<p>User’s interaction with the protocol can provide valuable insights. The need for active management can be primarily seen in <code>Long LTR</code> followed by less active management in the <code>Long ETH + ETH LST + ETH LRT</code> segment and the <code>Diversified Borrowers</code> (Chart 17). It is evident that, on average, a high number of events are performed by wallets with lower and higher health rates (Chart 18), while average health rates on average perform fewer actions. This can indicate that those in these categories must execute more actions to maintain their strategies. There is also a positive relation between how much users supply to the protocol and the number of actions they perform (Chart 19), meaning that the more someone supplies, the more likely they are to execute more actions.</p>\n<p>This distribution highlights a behavioral tendency towards active management in strategies perceived as higher risk, evidenced by the monthly need for more events and a lower health rate associated with <code>Long LRT</code> and <code>Long ETH + ETH LST + ETH LRT</code> strategies. In particular, Long LRT strategies exhibit the highest median value of events per month (3.5). Also, three wallets in the <code>Recursive ETH LST</code> category performed the highest number of actions in a month (45, 39, 38).</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the segments.</p>\n\nChart 9: Supply Amount Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 10: Percentage Supply Amount Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 11: Wallet Count Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 12: Percentage Supply Amount Per Supply Amount Bucket <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 13: Wallet Count Per Supply Amount Bucket <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 14: Top 10 Large Wallet Supply Percentage Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 15: Borrow Per Health Rate <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 16: Debt-Weighted Health Rate Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 17: Events Per Month Per Position Strategy <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 18: Events Per Month Per Health Rate <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 19: Events Per Month vs Supply Amount <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-external-capital-analysis-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-3-external-capital-analysis-8\"></a>3. External Capital Analysis</h1>\n<p>This analysis aims to assess how SparkLend users behave outside SparkLend by assessing their external capital held and cross-protocol usage. We define external capital as assets held outside the protocol that could be used to protect individual positions. External capital can either be passive (idle in the wallet) or active (used in other protocols). The data refers to a snapshot taken on 1 July 2024.</p>\n<p>SparkLend users hold approximately $5.17B in other protocols (Chart 20), $1.62B of which is in Maker (~31% of the total). The supply of other lending protocols equals 454M on Aave v3 and 146M on Ethena. Furthermore, other protocols used by SparkLend wallets are Lido, Stakefish, and Morpho AAVE. Together, Morpho AAVE (v1 and v3) has a supply from SparkLend users of $743M across 37 wallets.</p>\n<p>By looking at the passive external capital per asset (Chart 21), we can see that users hold WBTC ($164M), GNO ($143M), (W)ETH ($97M), and MKR ($81M) primarily. Since the previous analysis, there has been a significant drop in sDAI popularity, which has decreased from $73M to $24M. The majority of the wallets hold idle ETH (1230 wallets), DAI (400 wallets), and USDC (357 wallets). The other stablecoins are falling behind DAI and USDC, such as USDT ($27M, 216 wallets), sDAI ($24M, 143 wallets), and USDe ($13M, 83 wallets).</p>\n<p>Assessing passive external capital relative to debt (Chart 22), it is evident that 56.7% of users have enough passive external capital to cover 25% of their debt, a slight increase of 0.9 percentage points compared to the previous analysis. However, there has also been a slight increase (0.3 percentage points) in users with a buffer of more than 500% to 10.4% of users. In general, 26.6% of wallets have enough external capital to cover the total debt exposure.</p>\n<p>What would require more attention is the current passive external capital as a percentage of debt (Chart 23) since 86.3% of total debt is covered by less or equal to 25% of capital held in wallets, which was previously 66.2% in December, 78.6% in March, and 83.6% in April. In case of price drops or changing market conditions, this might negatively affect the protocol’s health. On the other hand, 6.7% of total debt is fully collateralized by capital held in wallets (down from 18.8% in March and 9.8% in April).</p>\n<p>Refer to the following charts for a deeper understanding of the external dynamics.</p>\n\nChart 20: Wallets' Active External Capital Per Protocol <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 21: Wallets' Passive External Capital Per Asset <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 22: Wallets' Passive External Capital Over SparkLend Borrow (Percentage of Wallets) <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nChart 23: Wallets' Passive External Capital Over SparkLend Borrow (Percentage of Debt) <a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-9\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The analysis highlighted a positive growth pattern for SparkLend during Q2-2024. While the protocol is still struggling to attract new user interaction (as the number of new wallets per month is still decreasing), the increase in total supplied and borrowed amounts in the last cohorts suggests higher popularity among larger users. Yet, it is essential to note that the five biggest wallets drive the most new supply and borrowing in the protocol from the last cohort. This shift is marked by a significant engagement of new cohorts and strong retention within earlier cohorts, indicating a reliance on established users even through less favorable market conditions.</p>\n<p>The segmentation analysis reveals that with the market moving again into a bullish sentiment, many SparkLend users also maintain bullish sentiment, particularly in long positions with substantial investments in Long Type 1 assets. At the same time, the small portion in short positions reflects a withdrawal from riskier strategies, aligning with the overall conservative trend observed in the cohort analysis. This behavior suggests that while SparkLend users continue to use the protocol, there is a tangible shift towards safety in response to market volatility.</p>\n<p>Regarding external dynamics, the analysis highlights a robust interaction with other protocols. However, there’s a decrease in passive external capital relative to debt, which could pose a risk in adverse market shifts. This condition requires more detailed monitoring of capital buffers to prevent potential liquidations, especially in a volatile market.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"future-work-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#future-work-10\"></a>Future Work</h1>\n<p>BA Labs plans to continue monitoring user metrics to ensure the protocol’s stability. We will also continue providing quarterly analyses of the most important dynamics and suggestions for tackling potential issues. At the same time, we plan to automate this kind of analysis to get live data on user behavior and promptly respond to changing market conditions.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 08:20:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24600"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/sparklend-user-metrics-growth-analysis-report-3/24600.rss","#text":"Sparklend User Metrics & Growth Analysis - Report #3"},"filter":true},{"title":"Promoting Blockchain-based finance system to NGO audience","dc:creator":"Liam_Bodin","category":"General Discussion","description":"<p>Hey all.

Accounting for Effective Borrow Rates (since users are able to earn some yield on the collateral they supply), Aave v2 markets (USDC and USDT) have particularly increased, with USDT going from ~9% to ~13% and USDC from ~12% to ~18%. At the same time, other v3 markets on Aave and Compound have witnessed a slight rate decrease. We are far from the mid-march environment where rates skyrocketed, and they have stabilized since then, with some minor peaks in mid-April, end of May and beginning of June. This can also be seen in the DeFi Rate 7-Day Volatility, with Aave v2 markets reaching 11% volatility at the beginning of June, with largest v3 markets being more stable. In the second half of June, the Rate Benchmark’s volatility has not surpassed 2%, implying a more stable situation in the DeFi rate ecosystem.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uiVMrLqj81Ub3dzHcXlqrtVuUBW.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_624x308.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uiVMrLqj81Ub3dzHcXlqrtVuUBW\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_624x308.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_936x462.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/d/4/d46513db355a83790385f7442fcbf74b64ddb7d0_2_1248x616.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F8F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/\">Blockanalitica</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9kZfoOCoQm9qfXPtW7E5QZVtA23.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_624x308.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9kZfoOCoQm9qfXPtW7E5QZVtA23\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_624x308.jpeg, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_936x462.jpeg 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/1/4172eb4348d11031777a9374f450d37d906def97_2_1248x616.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/\">Blockanalitica</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"funding-rates-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#funding-rates-3\"></a>Funding Rates</h2>\n<p>We are far from the March peak, where 7-Day Average funding rates for ETH and BTC have touched 60% APY.

The Stablecoin reserves drop is in line with what was expected after the Accelerated Proposal in March, which substantially increased them to avoid a possible depeg scenario. Following the <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp34-mip-amendment-subproposal/23971\">MIP-102c2-SP34</a>, stablecoin reserves should be equal to 25% of DAI Supply. Even though this is not the case currently, reserves are close to that value and, more importantly, have risen from the 20% registered at the beginning of June. Stablecoin reserves remain critical for the FiRE, since substantial deviations from the 25% threshold can introduce higher rates to incentivize collateral dynamics to go back to the equilibrium value.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9SLpBR55qAUgjWV1NlmzAP5NvnL.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_624x308.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9SLpBR55qAUgjWV1NlmzAP5NvnL\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_624x308.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_936x462.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/4/5/45445cfeb9f2a8c41759f060872905f0b2ffd625_2_1248x616.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/charts\">Makerburn</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"fire-implementation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#fire-implementation-5\"></a>FiRE Implementation</h1>\n<p>We have experimented with the FiRE to suggest optimal Base Rates and adjusted the DeFi Benchmark Rate to account for Effective Borrow Rates, which were at the time ignored. The main issues we encountered were the lagging reactions to rate decreases (since it utilizes EMAs to avoid rate spikes) and the non-feasibility of rate benchmarks. Specifically, the issue with DeFi competitive rates was fixed by implementing an Effective Rate Benchmark, while the issue persists for Funding Rates. For this reason, we have temporarily applied a 200 basis points spread (2%) to the Funding Rate Benchmark.</p>\n<p>The FiRE was run with the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CE: 0.7691</li>\n<li>LR: 0.0534</li>\n<li>BR: 0.0872</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And returned a Base Rate of 9.38%.</p>\n<p>This increase in the Base Rate is mainly due to Stablecoin Reserves being &lt;25%. Since we believe that, even though important, bringing Stablecoin Reserves to the 25% threshold is not trivial, we have re-run the model with TE: 0.80, hence allowing more room for breathing to the Base Rate. Under these conditions, the Base Rate was equal to 8.58%.</p>\n<p>Until the FiRE model is finalized based on research similar to this, we will use it as a reference and not strictly adhere to it when making our rate change recommendations. We will continue to adjust the model’s parameters before they are incorporated into the Stability Scope as determined by governance.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"dsr-changes-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dsr-changes-6\"></a>DSR Changes</h1>\n<p>The DAI in DSR, over the last two months, has been slightly dropping from its peak on 19 May, when it was equal to 2.2B.

Even though it dropped since then, it has stabilized around the 36% level, currently at 36.23%.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/d/9df8a5a9a8231364366a5fa736f9c2cb04442fab.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/mxtGAhxQ5hG1srrW9pCzpdZZLVp.png?dl=1\" title=\"Chart\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/d/9df8a5a9a8231364366a5fa736f9c2cb04442fab_2_624x385.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chart\" data-base62-sha1=\"mxtGAhxQ5hG1srrW9pCzpdZZLVp\" width=\"624\" height=\"385\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/d/9df8a5a9a8231364366a5fa736f9c2cb04442fab_2_624x385.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/9/d/9df8a5a9a8231364366a5fa736f9c2cb04442fab_2_936x577.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/9/d/9df8a5a9a8231364366a5fa736f9c2cb04442fab.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://makerburn.com/#/dsr\">Makerburn</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"feasibility-analysis-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#feasibility-analysis-7\"></a>Feasibility Analysis</h1>\n<p>The Estimates of Annualized Profits from vaults due to a rate change accounts for a 1% reduction in the DSR and a 1% reduction to Crypto Vaults Stability Fees on Maker Core and the Effective DAI borrow rate on SparkLend.
