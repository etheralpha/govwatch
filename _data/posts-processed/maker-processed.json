In addition to the standard features of Aave v3, Spark has a close integration with the core Maker protocol to facilitate deep liquidity and low, stable DAI borrowing rates.</p>\n<p>To date, the Sparklend mainnet deployment has restricted listings to a very limited number of assets including the largest and most lindy liquid staking tokens, which keeps the overall risk exposure of the market low. However, with the recent growth of restaking activity in defi, there is now a growing opportunity to take advantage of unmet borrowing demand by listing liquid restaking tokens (LRTs).</p>\n<p>Etherfi’s weETH is the largest and most liquid LRT on the market currently, with over $4 billion in TVL. Etherfi also stands out as the only large LRT with withdrawals fully enabled, which helps ensure stable liquidity and a strong peg vs underlying ETH. Given these features, and current low level of competition for borrowing USD stablecoins using LRT collateral, listing weETH offers an attractive growth opportunity to increase total DAI borrow volume on Sparklend.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"fundamental-risk-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#fundamental-risk-3\"></a>Fundamental Risk</h3>\n<p>This section covers fundamental and qualitative risk factors for Etherfi, Eigenlayer, and weETH.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"technical-risk-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#technical-risk-4\"></a>Technical Risk</h4>\n<p>Both Etherfi and Eigenlayer have gone through significant auditing and code review processes. Eigenlayer has undergone 4 audits plus an audit competition, while Etherfi has also undergone 4 audits plus an audit competition. Eigenlayer and Etherfi also offer bug bounty programs through Immunefi, with maximum payouts of $2 million and $200,000 respectively. While the auditing and bounty provisions are adequate, the maximum caps for bounties may be on the low end considering the amount of value secured in the protocols. In each case, the maximum bounty payout is well below 0.01% of the protocols’ TVL.</p>\n<p>Etherfi and Eigenlayer have both been operating without exploits or bugs for roughly 1 year. Given the significant time integrated TVL during this period, they have accrued a decent level of technical lindyness. However, each protocol has seen upgrades over this period particularly to support AVS, which opens up the possibility of bugs being introduced into the protocols. So we can only rely on historical time and TVL as evidence of security to a limited degree.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"validation-and-slashing-risk-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#validation-and-slashing-risk-5\"></a>Validation and Slashing Risk</h4>\n<p>As a liquid restaking token, weETH is subject to validation risk and slashing conditions for not only Ethereum protocol staking, but also staking via Eigenlayer AVS. Currently, Eigenlayer does not have slashing enabled for AVS staking, so there is no direct threat of slashing from operator failures during restaking. AVS slashing is not expected to be enabled in the near future, but over the medium term this will present an additional operational risk to LRTs like weETH.</p>\n<p>Etherfi currently has a whitelisting process to accept operators to validate for the protocol. Once whitelisted by the team (based on the team’s assessment of operator performance history and infrastructure), operators can place bids in ETH to earn the right to operate an Etherfi validator. There are plans to open up validation to more operators over time but the exact details to remove whitelisting have not been shared at present. As Etherfi onboards with more AVS, the operational overhead for validating for weETH is expected to increase significantly, and operator management may present a key challenge for scaling the protocol and minimizing slashing risk.</p>\n<p>Etherfi has also entered into certain restaking agreements with AVS which commit them to providing certain amounts of restaked value (eg. <a href=\"https://x.com/ether_fi/status/1771228157548384672\">Ethos</a>). This may help boost weETH returns, but also represents a significant commitment on the part of token holders due to restaking operational risks and lack of clarity over returns. If Etherfi is unable to provide the agreed upon restake amount, weETH holders may also lose the potential benefits of AVS rewards or token distributions.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"centralization-and-admin-risk-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#centralization-and-admin-risk-6\"></a>Centralization and Admin Risk</h4>\n<p>Etherfi recently launched their governance token ETHFI via an airdrop to stakers. However, at present key admin authorities over the protocol are controlled by a 4 of 7 multisig, with 3 signers from the core team and 4 external signers. Most controls sit behind a 3 day timelock, with the exception of AVS related actions which are not subject to timelock due to their active state of development and deployment. The timeline for renouncing centralized admin authorities or transferring them to the DAO is somewhat unclear, with a <a href=\"https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/governance/governance-roadmap\">stated plan</a> to deploy full DAO governance in the coming months. The ETHFI governance token is immutable and has a fixed supply.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"redemptions-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#redemptions-7\"></a>Redemptions</h4>\n<p>Etherfi stands out as the only large LRT to offer redemptions to ETH. This provides a key arbitrage mechanism in cases where weETH falls below the value of underlying ETH holdings, as users can buy up discounted weETH and then unstake. This is similar to other LSTs like stETH and rETH, where activation of redemptions has significantly improved their resilience and peg strength. As an example, stETH saw persistent discounts vs peg of up to 7% before redemptions were enabled, but since then the stETH price has consistently stayed within 0.5% of underlying value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether\">Coingecko stETH</a></p>\n<p>Eigenlayer introduces an additional 1 week withdrawal delay for restaked ETH, so we can expect that redemptions may provide somewhat lower price support for weETH versus traditional LSTs. Because of the additional Eigenlayer withdrawal delay, we estimate that fully withdrawing from weETH will take roughly 1 week longer than withdrawing from comparable LSTs like rETH or stETH. The result is that LRTs like weETH are likely to face larger discounts in a broad based market crash vs traditional LSTs like rETH and stETH, as the redemption arbitrage loop has a greater duration and therefore a lower yield to maturity for a given discount.</p>\n<p>EtherFi also maintains a pool of liquid ETH inside the protocol to service withdrawals within 24 hours of user requests. Historically, this has amounted to roughly 2-3% of total ETH backing, and currently it is somewhat higher at roughly ~120,000 ETH. This represents an additional source of available liquidity to service withdrawals immediately, which can help prevent weETH from trading below redemption value during a market crash.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"market-risk-and-liquidity-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#market-risk-and-liquidity-8\"></a>Market Risk and Liquidity</h3>\n<p>This section discusses market and liquidity risk factors and process for determining appropriate asset specific parameters.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"weeth-liquidity-profile-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#weeth-liquidity-profile-9\"></a>weETH Liquidity Profile</h4>\n<p>weETH has several onchain sources of liquidity via DEX pools, in addition to the primary market liquidity provided through minting and redemptions. The largest DEX for weETH on mainnet is Uniswap v3, with $84 million TVL in weETH&lt;&gt;ETH pool and $29 million TVL in weETH&lt;&gt;wstETH pool. Balancer also offers an additional liquidity source, with $46 million in a weETH&lt;&gt;rETH pool and $15 million in a LRT pool including weETH, Renzo’s ezETH, and Swell’s rswETH.</p>\n<p>However, the selection of pair assets makes some of these pools less resilient in case of broad market downturns or buildups in the Ethereum staking withdrawal queue. For example, the LRT Balancer pool provides limited assurance as neither ezETH or rswETH are currently redeemable, so any weETH sold through this pool would need to rely on limited secondary market liquidity for these tokens to swap into ETH or stablecoins. If a withdrawal queue builds up, then this could lead to broad based depegs across LSTs like wstETH and rETH, which would also drag down weETH price and make the weETH&lt;&gt;LST pools less useful.</p>\n<p>The Uniswap weETH&lt;&gt;ETH pool is arguably the most resilient and useful of the liquidity pools as it doesn’t have any reliance on other LSTs/LRTs. However, we note that there is only roughly 20,000 worth of ETH held in the pool available to buy weETH below peg, and it is highly concentrated within ~0.5% of current price. The weETH&lt;&gt;wstETH pool is similarly concentrated, with all wstETH buy side liquidity within 0.2% of current price.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7a415b19932c0105c82fdb6b720bb01b0cc2cae3\">Uniswap Info (v3 weETH&lt;&gt;ETH 0.05%)</a></p>\n<p>Taking aggregated liquidity across all sources from Cowswap, we see that sales up to around ~40,000 weETH can be executed with low market impact, but beyond this point liquidity drops off precipitously. Also note that because liquidity is highly concentrated around redemption price and relies partly on pairs with other LSTs/LRTs, we can expect the market depth to be much lower in cases where weETH trades below par or if there is broad based stress across staked ETH tokens.</p>\n<p>The biggest source of off-peg liquidity (eg. 1-10% away from redemption rate of weETH) is on Balancer, which holds significant liquidity in a composable stable pool, a pool type which provides concentrated liquidity but continues to provide at least some liquidity over the entire range of possible prices. We see the primary Balancer pool with rETH offers liquidity to sell roughly ~3,600 weETH with up to 1% price discount, ~500 additional weETH to reach 2% discount, ~250 to reach 3% discount, and only another ~650 weETH sold to reach all the way to 10% divergence from peg. This demonstrates just how thin liquidity gets below peg, even in the largest pool that provides for full range weETH liquidity on mainnet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1igwzRTyOSpPqVTyRmeAHIDAJwgdDSXPyFlrI4Qy8WX4/edit?usp=sharing\">Data: weETH on Sparklend Mainnet</a></p>\n<p>There are fairly significant pools of onchain leverage using weETH as collateral, which could potentially represent a demand on liquidity in a depeg event. Morpho has ~$15 million of ETH borrowed against weETH at up to 86% LTV, using live oracle pricing through Redstone. Aave has ~$595 million of ETH borrowed against weETH at up to 95% LTV (along with very small amounts of stablecoins collateralized by weETH), but in this case uses fixed pricing where eETH is assumed to always equal 1 ETH, which may lower the risk of sudden cascading liquidations. However, Aave users would still face some liquidation risk, as LST and LRT depegs would tend to push up the utilization and borrow rate for Aave ETH above rate of return for staking, which could push positions into liquidation over time via negative net interest accruals.</p>\n<p>To summarize, DEX liquidity for weETH is ample in normal conditions but may become exhausted during market crashes. The most important source of liquidity for weETH remains the primary market redemptions process. Deeper liquidity over a wider range below peg would help increase efficiency of the redemption arbitrage process during depegs, and provide additional assurance against disorderly flash crashes.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"oracle-settings-and-price-deviation-risk-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#oracle-settings-and-price-deviation-risk-10\"></a>Oracle Settings and Price Deviation Risk</h4>\n<p>weETH can be priced using live market pricing via oracle, or via exchange rate pricing as measured by the weETH to eETH ratio in the wrapping, considering eETH to be worth a fixed 1 ETH value based on redeemability. Aave currently uses an exchange rate pricing mechanism for weETH on their deployment, while Morpho uses live pricing.</p>\n<p>Live pricing has the advantage of potentially liquidation positions earlier in a depeg, before the price of weETH potentially falls further, and can also better account for the possibility of permanent impairments due to technical or slashing losses. But on the other hand, this also creates additional risk of liquidating at excessively low prices during a flash crash, as liquidations and oracle updates can lead to a negative feedback loop of lower prices creating more selling pressure creating further price drops. This sort of event was recently seen on Renzo’s ezETH, which crashed to below 0.8 ETH before quickly recovering.</p>\n<p>On balance, we believe using an exchange rate pricing mechanism rather than live oracle pricing is more appropriate for weETH. While the availability of redemptions may help reduce depeg risk, there is still a possibility of flash crashes occurring as it can take some time for bidders to step in to purchase weETH below par and arbitrage redemptions, while liquidations can happen immediately. Using exchange rate pricing eliminates the risk of liquidating positions based on short term price wicks, which can negatively impact UX and may even result in bad debt to the protocol depending on how low the price falls temporarily.</p>\n<p>However, using exchange rate pricing does create a few new risks. weETH trading at a discount to the exchange/redemption rate results in a higher effective liquidation threshold, as the fair market value of collateral will be lower than suggested by the protocol. And if the weETH discount is larger than the liquidation penalty for weETH collateral, this would halt the liquidation process as liquidating unsafe positions would no longer be profitable (the value of debt repaid would be greater than immediately achievable value of collateral received). weETH parameters such as liquidation threshold (LT), maximum loan to value ratio (LTV), and liquidation penalty should be set with this in mind to account for any reasonably foreseeable, persistent weETH price discounts.</p>\n<p>Our primary mode of evaluating maximum potential discount is by assessing arbitrage profitability from purchasing and redeeming discounted weETH. We make aggressive assumptions that 30% of staked ETH collateral on Aave, Maker, and Compound result in net withdrawals, and 10% of remaining staked ETH is withdrawn, resulting in roughly ~40 days to fully clear the staking withdrawal queue. Then, we compare LST withdrawals vs LRTs like weETH, based on the assumptions that the Eigenlayer withdrawal period puts LRTs towards the end of the exit queue and that arbitrageurs will demand more excess return to unstake LRTs versus traditional LSTs. The resulting estimates are shared below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ODf3MSsz-d_G_VGNgIUvgRlrfJ5O6mvqYRbY1av3nY/edit?usp=sharing\">LST Liquidity Risk</a></p>\n<p>We estimate that LRTs like weETH may experience mid single digit percent discounts based on these arbitrage assumptions, versus low single digit discounts for LSTs like stETH. This suggests that liquidation penalty and liquidation threshold should be set more conservatively for weETH vs Spark’s LST markets.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"weeth-parameters-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#weeth-parameters-11\"></a>weETH Parameters</h3>\n<p>The following parameters are proposed based on current market and liquidity conditions for weETH. We recommend to list weETH in isolation mode to prevent it from being used to borrow ETH on equal terms with stETH and rETH, which have a materially lower fundamental and liquidity risk profile. Current omnipool lending protocols like Sparklend cannot charge differential borrowing rates depending on collateral used, so allowing weETH to borrow ETH may not lead to increased ETH supply yield or protocol revenue until substantially all wstETH and rETH collateralized ETH borrowers have been displaced from the protocol. Until this threshold is reached, allowing this would result in increased protocol and liquidity risk with all value being leaked to consumer surplus of weETH collateral users.</p>\n<p>Isolation mode will allow weETH to only be used to borrow DAI, where the risk premia versus alternative collaterals can be equalized through the use of more conservative LTV and liquidation threshold parameters. Due to the significant impact of points earned on weETH, we recommend to disable borrowing as any supply yield earned would likely be less valuable than Etherfi and Eigenlayer points.</p>\n<p>Isolated debt ceiling is set to limit tail risk from unutilized borrowing capacity, with the debt ceiling roughly equaling Maker’s surplus buffer. However, if weETH collateral shows strong demand with the limit being utilized fully, the debt ceiling and supply cap max parameters can be progressively increased. Liquidation threshold is also set conservatively to account for potential price divergence, accommodating up to roughly 8% additional discount vs wstETH. Better liquidity depth below peg or demonstrated peg resilience during a broad based market crash would support raising LT and LTV closer towards parity with Spark’s wstETH and rETH parameters.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimal

One delinquent asset remains with a balance of $196k alongside two default assets (Hanhwa) totaling approximately $1.9M. These $2.1M in assets support 1.9M (market value) in Drop tokens, of which $1.7M belong to Maker’s vault.</p>\n<p>The legal process for the defaulted loans (Hanhwa) is still ongoing. In late May, ConsolFreight provided an update on the recovery process:</p>\n<p><em>We remain optimistic that the Court will grant our request for the Liquidator and Directed to provide many, if not most, of the documents we have sought through our subpoenas and preliminary discovery application. A separate application for preliminary discovery has been filed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Regarding our argument on “actual or apparent possession” of the goods that the Liquidator sold upon his appointment, we faced some challenges. While we had a strong enough argument to seek preliminary discovery, the Buyer Trade Finance Agreement (BTFA) does not entirely circumvent the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR) requirements in Australia. The PPSR ensures transparency regarding who has a security interest in goods through registration or possession.</em></p>\n<p><em>Despite these challenges, there is still potential for claims against the Liquidator if the documents reveal that he was aware of any wrongdoing by Hanhwa concerning our goods. Similarly, we may have claims against Directed if it is shown that they were aware of the BTFA when acquiring the goods before liquidation.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Court has not yet delivered a judgment, which is an unusual delay. The delay could indicate that the Registrar is carefully considering which documents should be provided, but it is difficult to determine the exact cause. The Registrar may simply have a heavy workload.</em></p>\n<p><em>With Hanhwa director now bankrupted and out of the picture, our straightforward claim has become more complex. Our chances of success against the Liquidator and Directed will largely depend on the Registrar’s decision on our preliminary discovery application and the documents produced. Once we have access to these documents, we will be able to provide a more informed opinion.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your continued patience and support. We will keep you informed of any further developments.</em></p>\n<p>As a reminder, on August 24th of 2023, Steakhouse and ConsolFreight <a href=\"//forum.makerdao.com/t/consolfreight-rwa-003-cf4-drop-default/21745\">alerted</a> MakerDAO that the pools largest position, Hanhwa, was expected to default.

Its goal is generating optimal Base Rates which depend on the real economy, centralized exchanges, and Maker’s collateral dynamics. The way this model will be implemented makes it possible to change the suggested parameters at any time. The final goal of the model is the automation of Stability Fees through an oracle-based implementation.</p>\n<p>In short, the FiRE generates the Base Rate using a Low-Risk Rate (the 3M T-bills) at 0% Crypto Exposure (percentage of DAI backed by crypto collateral) which increases until Target Crypto Exposure, where it will be equal to the Benchmark Rate (the funding rates on CEXs), scaled by a multiplier. After the Target Crypto Exposure, the rate increases at a larger rate, to reach a maximum (in this case 50%) at 100% Crypto Exposure. The final output of the model will be the Base Rate, which will then be used to calculate Stability Fees and various borrowing rates across AllocatorDAOs as part of the Endgame.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/7/c7a192edba2c465c65b535f98b730d7bb8bae35f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/su1bBypCwApg5ib1FtNT291lCuX.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/7/c7a192edba2c465c65b535f98b730d7bb8bae35f_2_624x363.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"su1bBypCwApg5ib1FtNT291lCuX\" width=\"624\" height=\"363\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/7/c7a192edba2c465c65b535f98b730d7bb8bae35f_2_624x363.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/c/7/c7a192edba2c465c65b535f98b730d7bb8bae35f_2_936x544.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/c/7/c7a192edba2c465c65b535f98b730d7bb8bae35f.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAFAFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The resulting stability fees will be the generated Base Rate plus spreads for different Liquidation Ratios and Vault Types or other future factors depending on the activity of AllocatorDAOs.</p>\n<p>Since we believe this would be an innovative approach to stability fee calculation, we are requesting the community’s feedback to comment, criticize, praise, or question this model, in order to improve it and make it a unique example in the DeFi landscape.

As an example, AAVE has adjusted GHO’s borrow rate and the Slope parameters of its markets based on the changes in DSR (<a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-stewards-borrow-rate-update/16956\">Proposal 1</a>, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stablecoin-ir-curve-amendment-on-aave-v2-and-v3-05-13-2024/17692\">Proposal 2</a>, <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stablecoin-ir-curve-amendment-on-aave-v2-and-v3-04-22-2024/17450\">Proposal 3</a>…). Exposure to crypto collateral is a very important parameter for Maker, since it can affect peg stability and profit estimation, by affecting the average yield that could be earned by the protocol.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, Maker’s approach to stability fees can be categorized into three phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjustment of the Stability Collateral Yield Benchmark and Yield Collateral Yield Benchmark</li>\n<li>Adjustment based on the Exposure Model</li>\n<li>Adjustment based on external rate environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first approach was unsuccessful because it relied solely on the Yield Collateral Yield Benchmark and the Stability Collateral Yield Benchmark, ignoring the potential external rates achievable in crypto markets. This oversight could result in DAI losing its peg. The second approach, while more accurate, failed to react promptly to sudden changes. The third approach, which successfully priced in borrow rates, presents a philosophical challenge for the Maker protocol and cannot be automated.</p>\n<p>In the DeFi ecosystem, this protocol is viewed as the rate “maker”, setting a standard that others should follow for rate expectations as the largest source of liquidity. However, the latest approach positions the protocol, to a certain extent, as a rate “taker”.</p>\n<p>Consequently, BA Labs is proposing a new framework for stability fee calculation that would position the protocol as a leader in DeFi rate management and in general be more reactive to the external rate environment. This framework would be responsive to developments in the real economy, centralized exchanges, and Maker itself. We suggest naming this framework the Fintegrate Rate Engine (FiRE), as it integrates various financial dimensions with the goal of becoming an automated, oracle-based model during the Endgame Initiative.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"fire-the-new-interest-rate-model-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#fire-the-new-interest-rate-model-3\"></a>FiRE - The new Interest Rate

This suggests that as Federal Reserve interest rates decline, investors turn to alternative yield sources, which in turn positively affect crypto prices, funding rates, and crypto exposure.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/a/fa657ac684f0b0b65c01b987d2576c93719fdf17.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zJ6MLP4j4S5UbHALGiRYA7nElPp.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/a/fa657ac684f0b0b65c01b987d2576c93719fdf17_2_624x420.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"zJ6MLP4j4S5UbHALGiRYA7nElPp\" width=\"624\" height=\"420\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/a/fa657ac684f0b0b65c01b987d2576c93719fdf17_2_624x420.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/f/a/fa657ac684f0b0b65c01b987d2576c93719fdf17_2_936x630.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/f/a/fa657ac684f0b0b65c01b987d2576c93719fdf17.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F9F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"historical-backtesting-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#historical-backtesting-17\"></a>Historical Backtesting</h2>\n<p>We first show the time series of input parameters and compare them to the historical Stability Fees for the ETH-C vault.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/6/3611bb502e2020fb72c165c709e2bab7eaeeb0ad.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7IjLWS0B64vP0w4mF8ZszpTC3Ip.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/6/3611bb502e2020fb72c165c709e2bab7eaeeb0ad_2_624x295.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"7IjLWS0B64vP0w4mF8ZszpTC3Ip\" width=\"624\" height=\"295\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/6/3611bb502e2020fb72c165c709e2bab7eaeeb0ad_2_624x295.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/3/6/3611bb502e2020fb72c165c709e2bab7eaeeb0ad_2_936x442.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/6/3611bb502e2020fb72c165c709e2bab7eaeeb0ad.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>We will now show the Interest Rates backtested during the same period and plotted against the actual stability fees experienced by Maker vaults’ users:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/a/ba782fedad83eee0f7d5475d9fbdd5e4a0d57870.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qBAjbtbZDt1cIFUhTshA4pVqL4s.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/a/ba782fedad83eee0f7d5475d9fbdd5e4a0d57870_2_624x337.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"qBAjbtbZDt1cIFUhTshA4pVqL4s\" width=\"624\" height=\"337\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"//makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/a/ba782fedad83eee0f7d5475d9fbdd5e4a0d57870_2_624x337.png, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/b/a/ba782fedad83eee0f7d5475d9fbdd5e4a0d57870_2_936x505.png 1.5x, //makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/b/a/ba782fedad83eee0f7d5475d9fbdd5e4a0d57870.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F8F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>When “zooming-in” the last 8 months, we can clearly see (even though in hindsight) that the model would have returned an Interest Rate that when applied to Stability Fees could have avoided the need for the “Accelerated Proposal”.

By incorporating the suggested parameters, we believe we would be able to propose stability fees that would mirror the market status correctly, in order to minimize the risk of having emergency situations or and/or further accelerated proposals.</p>\n<p>What is important to point out is that this model can be tweaked to reflect new parameters based on the market environment.

HTC utilized these and other funds to extend $2.1 million in loans to a consumer electronics company named Snakebyte. As of writing, the $2.1 million in loans to Snakebyte is the sole asset in the HTC pool, which serves as collateral for MakerDAO’s $1.6 million senior position.</p>\n<p>In April 2023, Snakebyte defaulted on its loan, prompting HTC to pursue legal action and successfully obtain a default judgment from the Superior Court of California - County of San Diego (the “Court”) against Snakebyte USA, Inc. This judgment empowered HTC to seize assets through a writ of attachment.</p>\n<p>Efforts to locate Snakebyte’s assets within the United States have proven challenging. However, legal counsel has advised that Snakebyte holds material assets in Germany. Consequently, HTC now seeks to enforce the California judgment in Germany, and requests a financial contribution from the DAO to cover the associated legal costs.</p>\n<p>The DAO Resolution below authorizes the allocation of $194,000 from the Launch Budget towards the HTC-Snakebyte litigation.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"dao-resolution-to-allocate-funds-to-htc-legal-action-against-snakebytehttpsipfsioipfsqmuiytry4bkv681tffe3ksj6gdleq27w34mqlw5lvrabod-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#dao-resolution-to-allocate-funds-to-htc-legal-action-against-snakebytehttpsipfsioipfsqmuiytry4bkv681tffe3ksj6gdleq27w34mqlw5lvrabod-2\"></a><a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUiYTRy4BkV681tfFe3Ksj6gdLEq27w34MqLw5LvRaBoD\">DAO Resolution to Allocate Funds to HTC Legal Action Against Snakebyte</a></h4>\n<h2><a name=\"key-figures-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#key-figures-3\"></a>Key Figures</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Amount</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Total borrowed by Snakebyte</td>\n<td>$2.1 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total owed to Maker</td>\n<td>$1.6 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>US legal costs estimate</td>\n<td>$73,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>German legal costs estimate</td>\n<td>$121,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total legal costs estimate</strong></td>\n<td><strong>$194,000</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Note:</strong> The estimated legal costs were arrived at by consulting with both California and German counsel.

It believes DAI should remain stable, decentralized and uncensorable. Also that MKR holders should be rewarded. While we embrace complexity, our mantra is “Keep it simple, stupid!”</p>\n<p>The KISS AVC identifies the following two fundamental goals.</p>\n<p><strong>G1)</strong> DAI, the decentralized stablecoin, is the product of MakerDAO and its main focus. It must remain stable, decentralized, open to everybody and uncensorable.</p>\n<p><strong>G2)</strong> People with stake in the game are DAI holders and MKR holders. DAI holders rely on the key characteristics of DAI listed above. MKR holders have invested their own money in the project and must to be rewarded. The reward must be primarily financial but can also come in other forms: sense of stability and trust in the protocol, status, fulfillment, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>The KISS AVC wants to achieve the above two goals by:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A)</strong> Embrace complexity.<br>\nThe two goals above are extremely ambitious and require sophisticated and complex solutions. MakerDAO needs to attract and keep the best talents in order to succeed.</p>\n<p><strong>B)</strong> Strive for simplicity.

The Governance Facilitators observed this delayed update and determined that it did not meet the Atlas’ “actively communicating” standard due to the 6-week delay. The AD argued that the Atlas does not specify a strict time requirement for submitting vote communications and requested the decision be reconsidered.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"interpretation-and-outcome-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#interpretation-and-outcome-2\"></a>Interpretation and Outcome:</h2>\n<p>According to the Atlas, Aligned Delegates (ADs) must meet specific participation and communication requirements to qualify for compensation. These requirements are outlined in sections 2.6.3.6 and 2.6.3.8, which emphasize timely and active participation and communication.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"key-clauses-from-the-atlas-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#key-clauses-from-the-atlas-3\"></a>Key Clauses from the Atlas:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-3-6\"><strong>2.6.3.6:</strong></a><br>\nADs must participate in AVC Subcommittee Meetings to qualify for full income. Participation must be meaningful and contribute useful research and information, which implies that the timeliness and relevance of participation are critical.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-3-7\"><strong>2.6.3.7:</strong></a><br>\nVoting activity metrics modify AD income payouts, requiring a high level of consistent voting activity over the past 6 months.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-3-8\"><strong>2.6.3.8:</strong></a><br>\nCommunication metrics for the last 12 months are also crucial. ADs must actively communicate their voting rationale to maintain transparency and assist MKR holders in understanding governance decisions. Specifically, if an AD actively communicates on less than 95% of votes over the last 6 months, their income is reduced.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"interpretation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#interpretation-4\"></a>Interpretation:</h3>\n<p>The term “actively communicating” in the context of the Atlas implies that ADs must provide timely and relevant communication about their voting activities. This requirement ensures transparency and allows MKR holders to understand the rationale behind votes in a timely manner. While the Atlas does not specify an exact timeframe for submitting communications, it is implicit that these should be done within a reasonable period after the vote to be considered “active.”</p>\n<p>Based on the facts provided, adding communications for February votes in April does not meet the standard of “actively communicating.” A 6-week delay undermines the purpose of timely and transparent governance. Thus, such retroactive edits should not count toward future compensation calculations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"reasonable-timeframe-for-communication-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#reasonable-timeframe-for-communication-5\"></a>Reasonable Timeframe for Communication:</h4>\n<p>To clarify the expectations and prevent similar disputes, we suggest implementing a specific timeframe for submitting vote communications. A period of one week after the conclusion of a vote is reasonable for ADs to provide their explanations and align with the Atlas’ intent of active participation. This timeframe ensures that communications are timely, relevant, and useful for governance purposes.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"discretion-for-extenuating-circumstances-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#discretion-for-extenuating-circumstances-6\"></a>Discretion for Extenuating Circumstances:</h4>\n<p>While the one-week rule provides clear guidance, some discretion should be granted to Governance Facilitators to account for extenuating circumstances. For instance, delays caused by technical issues, calendar irregularities, or other significant impediments could warrant exceptions. Facilitators should evaluate such cases individually to determine if a delay is justified.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"conclusion-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-7\"></a>Conclusion:</h3>\n<p>Editing or adding communications after a compensation period has ended should not count toward future compensation calculations. To maintain the integrity of the governance process, ADs must adhere to a one-week timeframe for submitting vote communications. Governance Facilitators should exercise discretion in exceptional cases but uphold the principle of timely and active communication as per the Atlas’ standards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"addendum-processing-expired-contracts-and-carryover-period-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#addendum-processing-expired-contracts-and-carryover-period-8\"></a>Addendum: Processing Expired Contracts and Carryover Period</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"context-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#context-9\"></a>Context:</h4>\n<p>There was an additional question when calculating compensation regarding how to handle expired delegate contracts and the MKR voting weight associated with them. Delegate contracts expire after one year, and sometimes MKR holders (delegators) do not immediately move their MKR to a new contract. This addendum provides guidance on how to process these expired contracts while maintaining compliance with the Atlas.</p>\n<h5><a name=\"conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#conclusion-10\"></a>Conclusion:</h5>\n<p>To ensure a smooth transition and prevent unnecessary disruptions in governance participation, we will allow for a <strong>two-week carryover period</strong> when a delegate contract expires. During this period, the voting weight from expired contracts will continue to count towards a delegate’s vote weight for compensation calculations. This approach balances the need for continuity with adherence to the Atlas’ requirements.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"justification-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#justification-11\"></a>Justification:</h4>\n<h5><a name=\"h-263-aligned-delegate-income-and-participation-requirements-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#h-263-aligned-delegate-income-and-participation-requirements-12\"></a>2.6.3: Aligned Delegate Income and Participation Requirements</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>ADs are eligible to receive income based on their voting weight and participation. This eligibility is critical for maintaining active and aligned governance participation.</li>\n<li>Ensuring a short carryover period helps maintain the integrity of compensation calculations while accommodating the practicalities of transitioning MKR voting weight.</li>\n<li>Delegates with active delegators, who can respond within a short period of change, should not be punished based on the arbitrary expiration of contracts. Two weeks provides ample time for delegates to broadcast their new contracts while not substantially risky security assumptions of delegation.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Attention: <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/aligned_delegates\">@Aligned_Delegates</a> <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/avc_member\">@AVC_Member</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/le_bateleur\">@Le_Bateleur</a> <a class=\"mention-group notify\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/groups/governance-reserve\">@Governance-Reserve</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-interpretation-communicating-votes-and-timeliness-for-delegate-compensation/24350\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-interpretation-communicating-votes-and-timeliness-for-delegate-compensation/24350","pubDate":"Thu, 23 May 2024 13:50:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.makerdao.com-topic-24350"},"source":{"@url":"http://forum.makerdao.com/t/atlas-interpretation-communicating-votes-and-timeliness-for-delegate-compensation/24350.rss","#text":"Atlas Interpretation: Communicating Votes and Timeliness for Delegate Compensation"},"filter":false},{"title":"Smart Burn Engine - Vow.hump (Surplus Buffer Upper Limit) Reconfiguration Update #7","dc:creator":"rema","category":"Maker Core","description":"<h3><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h3>\n<p>According to the MIP102c2-SP34 which is currently being <a href=\"https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmPr9vBz\">polled</a> and more than likely to be ratified since it already has an overwhelming support by the delegates, the Smart Burn Engine Surplus Buffer Upper Limit parameter defined in <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp34-mip-amendment-subproposal/23971/2\">Stability Scope 9.1.1 in SP34</a> is being increased for 5m dai to the total of 55m dai.</p>\n<p>This parameter determines the minimum threshold for when the SBE can start transacting, meaning that the system will now maintain a higher surplus buffer.

The benefits include anonymity and broad community engagement, while the challenges involve managing anonymous interactions and ensuring positive community behavior. By applying insights from urban sociology, we may be able to develop effective strategies to address these challenges.\n<h2><a name=\"the-urban-framework-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#the-urban-framework-2\"></a>The urban framework</h2>\n<p>The essence of urban life, with its blend of anonymity and community, provides a valuable framework for understanding interactions within DAOs. Anonymity in digital spaces, akin to the walking down the street of a city, offers individuals the freedom to express themselves without the constraints of their offline identities. However, this anonymity can also lead to challenges, particularly when it concerns accountability and behavior in online communities.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"anonymity-as-freedom-and-challenge-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#anonymity-as-freedom-and-challenge-3\"></a>Anonymity as freedom and challenge</h2>\n<p>The city’s anonymity offers a sense of freedom, allowing individuals to interact without the constraints of their real-world identities. This can encourage open expression and innovation. However, as Danah Boyd, a researcher specializing in online community dynamics, points out, this same anonymity can also disrupt social dynamics. It can enable individuals to act in ways they might avoid if their true identities were known, leading to behavior that can be harmful or disruptive. Boyd notes that while removing anonymity might seem like a solution to these issues, such challenges are complex and are not likely to be resolved simply by exposing real identities, reflecting the nuanced impact of anonymity in digital spaces.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"implementing-urban-social-codes-in-daos-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#implementing-urban-social-codes-in-daos-4\"></a>Implementing urban social codes in DAOs</h2>\n<p>Urban sociology introduces the concept of “civil inattention,” which Irving Goffman describes as a social behavior that allows individuals to coexist peacefully in crowded environments by acknowledging each other’s presence respectfully without intruding into personal space. This concept can be invaluable in digital communities, where respectful engagement needs to be balanced with privacy and personal boundaries.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"civil-inattention-in-digital-spaces-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#civil-inattention-in-digital-spaces-5\"></a>Civil inattention in digital spaces</h2>\n<p>In DAOs, implementing a digital form of civil inattention could involve community guidelines built into the Atlas that promote respectful acknowledgment without unnecessary intrusion—encouraging members to interact within the bounds of digital etiquette. This approach could help in managing interactions that might otherwise escalate into conflicts due to misinterpretation or the perceived anonymity shield.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"community-engagement-and-governance-establishing-norms-in-the-atlas-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#community-engagement-and-governance-establishing-norms-in-the-atlas-6\"></a>Community engagement and governance: establishing norms in the Atlas</h2>\n<p>One of the primary concerns within DAOs revolves around determining which behaviors are considered harmful enough to warrant moderation or even a ban, like  - deliberate malicious behavior. This requires a nuanced understanding of the community’s values and the specific context of each interaction.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"establishing-behavioral-norms-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#establishing-behavioral-norms-7\"></a>Establishing behavioral norms</h2>\n<p>Community engagement must focus on delineating clear guidelines that define acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. These norms should not only discourage detrimental activities but also promote a positive, constructive dialogue that enhances the community’s overall fabric.</p>\n<p>Powerhouse / <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/wouter\">@wouter</a> is hopefully considering this as they are figuring out the reputation system, while Atlas Axis / <a class=\"mention\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com/u/le_bateleur\">@Le_Bateleur</a> is dealing with the Atlas integration.</p>\n<p>To other community members reading along, lets start mapping malicious behaviour.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"encouraging-positive-engagement-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"http://forum.makerdao.com#encouraging-positive-engagement-8\"></a>Encouraging positive engagement</h2>\n<p>In our community, the anonymity that provides freedom can also, regrettably, be manipulated for less constructive purposes. Some people may use this veil of secrecy to create multiple accounts or amplify their own views in ways that do not reflect the true consensus of the community. Such actions not only skew honest dialogue but also threaten the integrity and trust.</p>\n<p>It’s important to recognize that while it is easier to critique and disrupt than to build and support, the lasting impact of our community depends on each of us choosing the harder right over the easier wrong.
