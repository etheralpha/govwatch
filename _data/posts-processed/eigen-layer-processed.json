After months of development in stealth, today we are sharing the Alpha V0.1 release of our <a href=\"https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/Anzen-Whitepaper-Release\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">whitepaper</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/anzen-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">codebase</a>, <a href=\"https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x419d8D025806F3cC118Bb1c110D8B12EaE1aEA77#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">live testnet</a> and <a href=\"https://dashboard.anzenprotocol.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example dashboard</a>. This early research release marks the first step in our mission of helping AVSs (Actively Validated Services, i.e. middleware on EigenLayer) increase security and reduce operator payment costs. Because this is an early release, exact details of the design and implementation are still subject to change as EigenLayer evolves.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-the-economic-security-challenge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#motivation-the-economic-security-challenge-2\"></a>Motivation: The Economic Security Challenge</h3>\n<p>Economic security is hard, and the purpose of EigenLayer is to help AVSs bootstrap their security in a faster and more efficient manner. With EigenLayer, instead of bootstrapping a siloed network for economic security, AVSs can tap into an existing network for shared economic security with an existing and efficient marketplace for decentralized trust. By adjusting the fees paid to incentivize operators, AVSs can target a certain amount of economic security they purchase.</p>\n<p>But how does a new AVS know how much they need to pay for economic security? How much economic security is needed to secure their protocol and prevent an economic attack? How do they ensure they are constantly meeting the minimum amount of economic security while avoiding over-paying operators? These are the challenges specific to AVSs that we aim to solve.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"introducing-the-safety-factor-sf-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#introducing-the-safety-factor-sf-3\"></a>Introducing the Safety Factor (SF)</h3>\n<p>In order to make economic security easily understandable for AVSs, we first needed a comprehensive metric. We created the Safety Factor (SF) as a generalized standard metric to use for measuring AVS economic security, akin to health factors widely utilized throughout DeFi. The SF is based on the concepts of Cost of Corruption (CoC) and Profit from Corruption (PoC) and is defined in our whitepaper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90aab5d7-65c0-41df-82ab-3c3a23d6322b_1920x1080.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6JG1IuEXH40ScAdLwdUt0ExVO19.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"6JG1IuEXH40ScAdLwdUt0ExVO19\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"19181E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>When the SF is below 0, it means that a protocol is vulnerable to economic exploit (akin to health factor falling into liquidation territory).</p>\n<p>When the SF approaches 1, it means that an AVS is overpaying for economic security.</p>\n<p>We expect the typical SF to trend near a target buffer above 0 to avoid being too close to an economic exploit. Analogously, DeFi users typically maintain a margin above the minimum Health Factor in order to prevent being liquidated.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protocol-overview-alpha-v01-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#protocol-overview-alpha-v01-4\"></a>Protocol Overview (Alpha v0.1)</h3>\n<p>Now that we know how to measure economic security on EigenLayer, we need to make sure that we stay within our desired target range. In order to achieve this, Anzen Protocol delivers live SF data on-chain via an economic security oracle, called the SF Oracle. SF data is then consumed by a contract called the AVS Reserves Manager in order to dynamically adjust payment fees.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c640e8-834b-4aaf-9ca5-34769911697a_4504x4000.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/0/096a7a06f4533019674ebb063b610b3f89e9456c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1liqbSl6Mr0WCBdvoT1m1eti5iY.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/0/096a7a06f4533019674ebb063b610b3f89e9456c_2_563x500.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1liqbSl6Mr0WCBdvoT1m1eti5iY\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"563\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/0/096a7a06f4533019674ebb063b610b3f89e9456c_2_563x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/0/096a7a06f4533019674ebb063b610b3f89e9456c_2_844x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/0/096a7a06f4533019674ebb063b610b3f89e9456c_2_1126x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"252146\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The SF Oracle calculates the SF for all integrated AVSs and delivers the results on-chain. Each AVS integrated with Anzen protocol has a customized SF Oracle Module which is programmed to calculate the SF for a given AVS. The SF Oracle Module queries external data sources, performs calculations and risk management computations, and returns the resulting response to the oracle, which then broadcasts all of the results on-chain. Before an SF Oracle Module is deployed, it is recommended to conduct economic security modeling and auditing.</p>\n<p>The AVS Reserves Manager is a contract that integrates with the EigenLayer AVS Payments manager to regulate the flow of AVS operator payments. With the SF now delivered on-chain, the AVS Reserves Manager is capable of increasing or decreasing the rate of operator payments in order to target a desired SF level. When there is a surplus of economic security, operator payments can be reduced to save money for the AVS. When there is a shortage of economic security, operator payments must be increased to safeguard the AVS.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"benefits-for-avss-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#benefits-for-avss-5\"></a>Benefits for AVSs</h3>\n<p>The benefits of Anzen Protocol for AVSs are clear: reduced operator payment costs and increased security. Another benefit is insight: we are building a comprehensive dashboard for AVSs to monitor and understand their AVSs economic security information in simple terms and to launch new AVSs with a clear understanding of the associated costs and requirements. The importance of contract security is also paramount; in our alpha testnet, we include rate limits in the AVS Reserves Manager for maximum security.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"testnet-deployment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#testnet-deployment-6\"></a>Testnet Deployment</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83aa8e6-de43-415a-8c07-b72beffef3b6_1600x498.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gV7DOguxRNThZjahe0O8ashNdUt.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_690x214.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gV7DOguxRNThZjahe0O8ashNdUt\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_690x214.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_1035x321.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_1380x428.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEEF2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/anzen-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/anzen-contracts</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"example-dashboard-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#example-dashboard-7\"></a>Example Dashboard</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75dcae16-9ef1-458d-bcad-42faa4e586ed_916x763.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/a6euOLAjupucMTsFDQU1zQRO8lr.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1_2_600x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"a6euOLAjupucMTsFDQU1zQRO8lr\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1_2_600x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1_2_900x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1F1C1A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"links-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#links-8\"></a>Links</h3>\n<p>Learn more about Anzen Protocol by joining our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/54bKCbAA5E\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">discord</a> community or following us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnzenProtocol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X (Twitter</a>).

Amazing…</p>\n<p>I never believed that Eth could ever flip BTC and still I guess it is unlikely but that said, Eth seems to become the true value layer of the internet of blockchains - and Ether being a deflationary asset - it seems that Eth could contest Bitcoin for its value preposition when nothing could contest Eth. Bitcoins value comes from our consensus about its role, which is dependent on its market cap. The higher it is relative to other crypto currencies, the more distinct its role is. Ethereum is different, it is valued not for it’s first-in-kind role nor for its valuation but for the activity, value, and innovation that is generated in its ecosystem. One could say that Eth has fundamental value and Bitcoin consensual value. If Ethereum closes in on Bitcoin in terms of its valuation, Bitcoins consensual value might accrue to Eth and if Bitcoin is flipped, it may lose its entire consensual value to Eth. A catalyst for this could be a hard cap on Eth that may as well be introduced considering the given deflationary monetary supply of Eth.

As someone who is an active contributor to the Sommelier protocol and also a believer in the restaking movement that Eigenlayer is pioneering, including a new restaking market for Real Yield ETH (YieldETH) would be mutually beneficial to both protocols. Specifically, adding a YieldETH market will not only increase Eigenlayer TVL, and therefore usage, but it will also increase the utility for YieldETH due to the restaking yield.</p>\n<p>YieldETH Asset Exposure: (w)stETH, rETH, cbETH</p>\n<p>YieldETH Protocol Exposure: Uniswap v3, Aave, Morpho</p>\n<p>YieldETH TVL: ~$40M (18k ETH)</p>\n<p>YieldETH Launch: April 12, 2023</p>\n<p><strong>About Sommelier</strong><br>\nSommelier is an innovative asset management protocol that enables intelligent vaults to ingest real-time market information and dynamically adapt to market conditions, providing enhanced opportunities and risk mitigation for users. All vaults are enabled by audited smart contracts and controlled by protocol governance, ensuring transparency and security.</p>\n<p>Sommelier has experienced rapid growth in 2023, growing from $1M to nearly $65M in TVL. It is the 4th largest yield aggregator on Ethereum and plans to go multichain in 2024. It is also quickly becoming an LST liquidity hub for assets like (w)stETH and swETH with additional LST vaults in the pipeline.</p>\n<p>Sommelier was founded by Zaki Manian and Kristi Poldsam and backed by Polychain, Multicoin Capital, Standard Crypto and others.</p>\n<p><strong>Sommelier Governance</strong><br>\nThe Sommelier protocol is governed by SOMM token holders. A number of items must be voted on and approved by the community including strategist onboarding, Vault (Cellar) activations, community spend proposals (which allocate funding from the SOMM community pool), protocol upgrades, and parameter changes.</p>\n<p><strong>About Real Yield ETH (YieldETH)</strong><br>\nSommelier’s flagship vault is a LST DeFi vault called Real Yield ETH. The vault optimally allocates across w/stETH, cbETH and rETH and uses those assets in leveraged staking positions on Aave and Morpho and concentrated LPing on Uniswap V3. Other blue chip protocol integrations are in development.</p>\n<p>YieldETH is ERC-4626 compliant and follows a c-Token model. As a result, the relative value of YieldETH to ETH increases. While the number of YieldETH tokens remains consistent (considering no no new deposits into or withdrawals out of YieldETH), the underlying value of the ETH rises due to these rewards, prompting its value increase.</p>\n<p>There are no lockups with YieldETH and users can withdraw from the vault at any time. Future LSTs, yield strategies and DeFi protocols can be added to YieldETH through Sommelier token governance.</p>\n<p><strong>Growth and Performance</strong><br>\nThe vault has approximately ~$40M of TVL (18k ETH) and has generated ~8% organic annualized yield since launching in April. The exceptional yield performance has been driven by dynamic, monitored leveraged staking and efficient liquidity provision on Uniswap v3 (over 130 ETH in fees). The high yield performance and ERC-4626 compatibility are two factors that should drive continued growth of the vault making it an increasingly relevant TVL funnel for Eigenlayer.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/4/42ceeb59db3c40562e8df4d931b53b55d2b3a36b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9x0POoukoEDRadUbh3aFHsymiZJ.png?dl=1\" title=\"newplot (22)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/42ceeb59db3c40562e8df4d931b53b55d2b3a36b_2_517x282.png\" alt=\"newplot (22)\" data-base62-sha1=\"9x0POoukoEDRadUbh3aFHsymiZJ\" width=\"517\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/42ceeb59db3c40562e8df4d931b53b55d2b3a36b_2_517x282.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/42ceeb59db3c40562e8df4d931b53b55d2b3a36b_2_775x423.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/4/42ceeb59db3c40562e8df4d931b53b55d2b3a36b.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"091D15\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/6/6e17ffc4b0e8341184c558a6662fbd4b8ef4b6bb.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fHVWfIDgXp1BRd6yez93m5EkX2j.png?dl=1\" title=\"newplot (24)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/6/6e17ffc4b0e8341184c558a6662fbd4b8ef4b6bb_2_517x282.png\" alt=\"newplot (24)\" data-base62-sha1=\"fHVWfIDgXp1BRd6yez93m5EkX2j\" width=\"517\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/6/6e17ffc4b0e8341184c558a6662fbd4b8ef4b6bb_2_517x282.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/6/6e17ffc4b0e8341184c558a6662fbd4b8ef4b6bb_2_775x423.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/6/6e17ffc4b0e8341184c558a6662fbd4b8ef4b6bb.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"0A1A14\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Oracles and Pricing</strong><br>\nThe YieldETH token itself does not have an oracle, but the preview functions in the smart contract report the share token price based on on-chain conditions.

However, since restaking markets already exist for these assets on Eigenlayer, it is assumed that the network is not taking any incremental risk on this dimension.</p>\n<p><strong>References/Useful Links</strong></p>\n<p><em>Sommelier Resources</em><br>\nSommelier Website: <a href=\"https://www.sommelier.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.sommelier.finance/</a><br>\nDapp: <a href=\"https://app.sommelier.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.sommelier.finance/</a><br>\nSommelier Protocol Docs: <a href=\"https://sommelier-finance.gitbook.io/sommelier-documentation/introduction/what-is-sommelier\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://sommelier-finance.gitbook.io/sommelier-documentation/introduction/what-is-sommelier</a><br>\nGithub: <a href=\"https://github.com/PeggyJV\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/PeggyJV</a><br>\nAudits: <a href=\"https://www.sommelier.finance/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.sommelier.finance/audits</a><br>\nBug Bounty: <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bounty/sommelier/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://immunefi.com/bounty/sommelier/</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sommfinance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/sommfinance</a><br>\nTelegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/getsomm\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://t.me/getsomm</a><br>\nDiscord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/ZcAYgSBxvY\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://discord.com/invite/ZcAYgSBxvY</a></p>\n<p><em>Real Yield ETH (YieldETH) Resources</em><br>\nYieldETH Dapp Page: <a href=\"https://app.sommelier.finance/strategies/Real-Yield-ETH/manage\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.sommelier.finance/strategies/Real-Yield-ETH/manage</a><br>\nYieldETH Blog Explainer: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sommelier.finance/real-yield-eth-is-here-to-optimize-your-eth-liquid-staking-tokens-c52f686e18ef\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://medium.com/@sommelier.finance/real-yield-eth-is-here-to-optimize-your-eth-liquid-staking-tokens-c52f686e18ef</a><br>\nToken Contract: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0xb5b29320d2Dde5BA5BAFA1EbcD270052070483ec\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://etherscan.io/token/0xb5b29320d2Dde5BA5BAFA1EbcD270052070483ec</a><br>\nAudits: <a href=\"https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits</a><br>\nBug Bounty: <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bounty/sommelier/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://immunefi.com/bounty/sommelier/</a><br>\nDashboard: <a href=\"https://ryeth.sevenseas.capital/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ryeth.sevenseas.capital/</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/new-eigenlayer-lst-real-yield-eth-yieldeth-by-sommelier/12325\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/new-eigenlayer-lst-real-yield-eth-yieldeth-by-sommelier/12325","pubDate":"Mon, 18 Dec 2023 21:14:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.eigenlayer.xyz-topic-12325"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/new-eigenlayer-lst-real-yield-eth-yieldeth-by-sommelier/12325.rss","#text":"New Eigenlayer LST: Real Yield ETH (YieldETH) by Sommelier"},"filter":false},{"title":"Octopus Contract and its application","dc:creator":"LeonaHioki","category":"🔬New Middleware R&D","description":"<p>Authors: Sora Suegami, Leona Hioki</p>\n<h1><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR</h1>\n<p>We propose the concept of Octopus contracts, smart contracts that operate ciphertexts outside the blockchain. Octopus contracts can control the decryption of the ciphertexts based on on-chain conditions by requesting validators to sign the specified messages. Signature-based witness encryption (SWE) enables users to decrypt them with the signatures. Moreover, Octopus contracts can evaluate arbitrary functions on encrypted inputs with one-time programs (OTPs) built from SWE and garbled circuits. These features extend the functionality of smart contracts beyond the blockchain, providing practical solutions for unresolved problems such as a trustless bridge for a two-way peg between Bitcoin and Ethereum, private AMM, minimal anti-collusion infrastructure without a centralized operator, and achieving new applications such as private and unique human ID with proof of attribution, private computation with web data.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"with-eigen-layer-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#with-eigen-layer-2\"></a>With Eigen Layer</h1>\n<p>There are several methods to select a validator set from the consensus layer of Ethereum as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hard fork Ethereum to force all validators to sign messages from Octopus contracts.</li>\n<li>Soft fork Ethereum, allowing any validators to sign messages from Octopus contracts.</li>\n<li>Use a re-staking mechanism such as <a href=\"https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/readme/whitepaper\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Eigen Layer</a>, enabling validators to have dual roles.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even in the first case, which imposes the greatest burden on the Ethereum network, the validators’ signatures for the same messages can be aggregated, so that the additional cost of pairing is at most for each ciphertext.

Currently there are only three markets for restaking tokens on Eigenlayer. This is a proposal for a new restaking market, Origin Ether (OETH), to be added alongside the existing markets for Lido, Rocketpool, and Coinbase.</p>\n<p><strong>Synergies with EigenLayer</strong></p>\n<p>Adding an OETH market will be mutually beneficial for both Eigenlayer and Origin Protocol, as it will increase the utility for OETH, while also increasing the TVL and usage of the Eigenlayer protocol. Both Origin Ether and Eigenlayer are visionaries and leaders in the Defi and LSTfi space.</p>\n<p><strong>Background on Origin Protocol</strong></p>\n<p>Origin was founded by Web3 veterans Josh Fraser and Matthew Liu in 2017 and is one of the most venerable projects in the space. Josh and Matthew are joined by the fully doxxed Origin <a href=\"https://www.originprotocol.com/community\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">team</a> and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors. Origin has raised $38.1M from top investors including Pantera, Spartan Group, Foundation Capital, BlockTower Capital, Steve Chen, Garry Tan, and Alexis Ohanian, and currently maintains a multimillion dollar treasury. As a technology partner, Origin Story has helped launch some of the largest NFT projects to-date. Origin Story was followed up with <a href=\"https://ousd.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Origin Dollar</a>, a yield-generating stablecoin that reached a TVL of $300m in 2022. Origin Ether is Origin’s 3rd and latest launch.</p>\n<p><strong>Origin Ether</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oeth.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Origin Ether</a> was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates yield while sitting in your wallet by tapping into blue-chip protocols. OETH is backed 1:1 by stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.</p>\n<p>OETH yield comes from a combination of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deploying ETH/WETH across Curve, Convex, Balancer, Aura, and Morpho</li>\n<li>LST validator rewards</li>\n<li>A 50bp exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the <a href=\"https://app.oeth.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dapp</a> (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders</li>\n<li>OETH sitting in non-upgradable contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding any single LST or farming ETH manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times via the <a href=\"https://www.oeth.com/analytics\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OETH analytics page</a>. Future OETH collateral and yield strategies are governed by <a href=\"https://governance.ousd.com/stake\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OGV stakers</a>. More information on OETH and its mechanics can be found in the <a href=\"https://docs.oeth.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OETH docs</a>.</p>\n<p>There is deep on-chain liquidity, therefore obtaining OETH is seamless. Users can convert into OETH via any of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minting on <a href=\"http://oeth.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OETH.com</a></li>\n<li>Swapping on <a href=\"https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Curve</a></li>\n<li>Swapping on <a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&amp;outputCurrency=ETH\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap</a></li>\n<li>Swapping on <a href=\"https://app.mav.xyz/pool?chain=1&amp;tokenA=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&amp;tokenB=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&amp;fee=0.0004&amp;width=0.001\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Maverick</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are no lockups with OETH, users can move in and out of OETH at all times. OETH remains completely liquid at all times, and can be spent in the same way as its backing collateral, if unexpected expenses were to arise.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance &amp; Growth</strong></p>\n<p>The OETH TVL, now over $87m (39,094 ETH), has been trending upwards and has been well received by users with the yield OETH is generating. OETH yield is currently at 5.43% APY, whereas native staking yield on ethereum has ranged from 3.03% - 4.03% APY over the last few months.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/1/1a153c8a00cfed81c3f98acb18d328c68a9cd787.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3IJUCgO6snm1zxvHvJGHPMd7ztt.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2023-12-04 at 1.52.41 PM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/1/1a153c8a00cfed81c3f98acb18d328c68a9cd787_2_690x328.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-04 at 1.52.41 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"3IJUCgO6snm1zxvHvJGHPMd7ztt\" width=\"690\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/1/1a153c8a00cfed81c3f98acb18d328c68a9cd787_2_690x328.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/1/1a153c8a00cfed81c3f98acb18d328c68a9cd787_2_1035x492.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/1/1a153c8a00cfed81c3f98acb18d328c68a9cd787.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"424166\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Oracles &amp; Price Feeds</strong></p>\n<p>Since OETH is designed to remain pegged to ETH, some projects are using standard ETH oracles for OETH.

As of an October 17th <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth/proposal/0x66a9e0040db9a6f993a43edfb6058d7a8eee355fdf866878ab9e990be38672f6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot vote</a>, 50% of this fee is distributed to stakers of OGV, and the remaining 50% is used to purchase tokens from strategic partners for the DAO to maintain long-term growth of the protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Risks and Mitigation</strong></p>\n<p>The introduction of OETH provides an opportunity for diversification and broadening the collateral base while mitigating concentration risks. However, Origin does acknowledge the concerns around the potential risks associated with OETH too. There are a few potential risks when using OETH, and Origin is making sure to reduce each risk as much as possible:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Counterparty Risk</em> - OETH is governed by OGV stakeholders around the world. Everything from yield generation to fee collection and distribution is managed by a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are upgradeable with a timelock and are controlled by hundreds of governance token holders. While the initial contracts and yield-earning strategies were developed by the Origin team, anyone can shape the future of OETH by creating or voting on proposals, submitting new strategies, or contributing code improvements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Smart Contract Risk: Yield Strategies, OETH</em></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Yield Strategies:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Origin is only using platforms for yield generation that have a proven track record, have been audited, have billions in TVL, maintain a bug bounty program, and provide over-collateralized loans.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>OETH:</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Origin is taking every step possible to be proactive and lessen the chance of losing funds. Security reviews are prioritized over new feature development, with regular audits being done, and multiple engineers are required to review each code change with a detailed checklist. OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All audits can be seen on <a href=\"https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Audits - OUSD </a>, and OpenZeppelin is now on retainer. On-chain insurance protocol InsurAce awarded OETH and OUSD the <a href=\"https://app.insurace.io/coverage/buycovers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">highest possible security rating of AAA</a>, of which only 3 other projects on the InsurAce platform have received. Optional OETH cover is currently available for both OETH and OUSD on InsurAce. Origin Defi also maintains a $1m bug bounty through <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/explore/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Immunefi</a>, with a resolution time of 7 hours.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p><em>Collateral Risk</em> - Origin has chosen 3 of the largest and most well respected LSTs to back OETH: Frax, Rocketpool, Lido. They have all demonstrated significant growth in circulating supply and have maintained their peg quite well since the launch. To ensure accurate pricing at all times, OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and a dual oracle for frxETH that combines two sources: the Curve frxETH/ETH EMA oracle and the Uniswap frxETH/FRAX TWAP oracle. In situations where any OETH collateral falls below peg, <a href=\"https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/issues/1000\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OIP-4 disables minting</a> of additional OETH tokens using the de-pegged asset.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Slashing Ris</em>k - Since OETH is collateralized by multiple LSTs at the same time, OETH is protected from slashing from any individual collateral LST.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Small Scale: OETH yield will simply decrease, as income will likely exceed the size of the slash.</li>\n<li>Large Scale: Both the slashed LST and OETH will experience a drop in value relative to ETH, but OETH should not fall as low and for as long as the slashed LST, as the remaining un-slashed OETH collateral LSTs will soften the blow. There will never be a negative OETH rebase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, Many members of the Origin team, including both founders, are holding a significant portion of their personal wealth in OETH.
