An interesting idea popped up, thought I’d share it here to get feedback before exploring building it out:</p>\n<p><strong>What?</strong><br>\nA protocol that enables users to automatically make recurring payments directly from the rewards they collect on re-staking. Imagine purchasing subscriptions to X, Netflix, Patreon, other new web3 services, simply from the staking rewards you earn.</p>\n<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>For consumers:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>re-staking rewards may be volatile. Allocating some % to usable subscriptions can capture value immediately, to balance out the risk of holding the token.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>For apps:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>psychologically, users view spending staking rewards differently from existing cash because they are committing “found money”. the mental math that the user does when committing to a long-term subscription is fundamentally different.</li>\n<li>could reduce barrier to entry for customer acquisition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Web2 prevents users from automating spend from passive income like dividends, mutual funds, etc. This is unlocked in web3 because of composability but also because the epoch of rewards being paid out is much less.</p>\n<p><strong>How?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The protocol connects to a user’s wallet and understands its re-staking profile.</li>\n<li>Allows a registry of apps to accept stakescription payments</li>\n<li>For every given active subscription per user, the system converts staking rewards over an epoch algorithmically so that there is just the right amount by the time payment is due.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/stakescription-automatically-use-staking-rewards-for-recurring-payments/13281\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/stakescription-automatically-use-staking-rewards-for-recurring-payments/13281","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Apr 2024 21:39:49 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.eigenlayer.xyz-topic-13281"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/stakescription-automatically-use-staking-rewards-for-recurring-payments/13281.rss","#text":"Stakescription: Automatically use staking rewards for recurring payments"},"filter":false},{"title":"EigenLayer News: Uncapped LSTs and restaking deposits unpaused, April 16th","dc:creator":"web3citizenxyz","category":"🌞General","description":"<h1><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#tldr-1\"></a><strong>TL;DR</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LST caps removed and restaking deposits unpaused</strong></li>\n<li><strong>AVSs live on Mainnet</strong></li>\n<li>TVL watch: $12.5b</li>\n<li>Aligned Layer raises $2.6M</li>\n<li>Espresso partners with 100 nodes for Cappuccino testnet</li>\n<li>EigenDA stats a week since Mainnet launch</li>\n<li>AVS Spotlight: Witness Chain</li>\n<li>LRP Spotlight: Renzo</li>\n<li>First EigenLayer Hackathon by Encode Club</li>\n<li>FHE x EigenLayer spaces</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"ecosystem-news-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#ecosystem-news-2\"></a><strong><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/globe_with_meridians.png?v=12\" title=\":globe_with_meridians:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":globe_with_meridians:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Ecosystem News:</strong></h1>\n<h3><a name=\"lst-caps-removed-restaking-deposits-unpaused-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#lst-caps-removed-restaking-deposits-unpaused-3\"></a><strong>LST caps removed &amp; restaking deposits unpaused</strong></h3>\n<p>Today EigenLayer removed all LST caps and unpaused deposits.

After months of development in stealth, today we are sharing the Alpha V0.1 release of our <a href=\"https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/Anzen-Whitepaper-Release\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">whitepaper</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/anzen-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">codebase</a>, <a href=\"https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x419d8D025806F3cC118Bb1c110D8B12EaE1aEA77#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">live testnet</a> and <a href=\"https://dashboard.anzenprotocol.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example dashboard</a>. This early research release marks the first step in our mission of helping AVSs (Actively Validated Services, i.e. middleware on EigenLayer) increase security and reduce operator payment costs. Because this is an early release, exact details of the design and implementation are still subject to change as EigenLayer evolves.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-the-economic-security-challenge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#motivation-the-economic-security-challenge-2\"></a>Motivation: The Economic Security Challenge</h3>\n<p>Economic security is hard, and the purpose of EigenLayer is to help AVSs bootstrap their security in a faster and more efficient manner. With EigenLayer, instead of bootstrapping a siloed network for economic security, AVSs can tap into an existing network for shared economic security with an existing and efficient marketplace for decentralized trust. By adjusting the fees paid to incentivize operators, AVSs can target a certain amount of economic security they purchase.</p>\n<p>But how does a new AVS know how much they need to pay for economic security? How much economic security is needed to secure their protocol and prevent an economic attack? How do they ensure they are constantly meeting the minimum amount of economic security while avoiding over-paying operators? These are the challenges specific to AVSs that we aim to solve.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"introducing-the-safety-factor-sf-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#introducing-the-safety-factor-sf-3\"></a>Introducing the Safety Factor (SF)</h3>\n<p>In order to make economic security easily understandable for AVSs, we first needed a comprehensive metric. We created the Safety Factor (SF) as a generalized standard metric to use for measuring AVS economic security, akin to health factors widely utilized throughout DeFi. The SF is based on the concepts of Cost of Corruption (CoC) and Profit from Corruption (PoC) and is defined in our whitepaper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90aab5d7-65c0-41df-82ab-3c3a23d6322b_1920x1080.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6JG1IuEXH40ScAdLwdUt0ExVO19.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"6JG1IuEXH40ScAdLwdUt0ExVO19\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/2/2f36e215b3ed257dbbf024dddef25525b61a24d7_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"19181E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>When the SF is below 0, it means that a protocol is vulnerable to economic exploit (akin to health factor falling into liquidation territory).</p>\n<p>When the SF approaches 1, it means that an AVS is overpaying for economic security.</p>\n<p>We expect the typical SF to trend near a target buffer above 0 to avoid being too close to an economic exploit. Analogously, DeFi users typically maintain a margin above the minimum Health Factor in order to prevent being liquidated.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protocol-overview-alpha-v01-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#protocol-overview-alpha-v01-4\"></a>Protocol Overview (Alpha v0.1)</h3>\n<p>Now that we know how to measure economic security on EigenLayer, we need to make sure that we stay within our desired target range. In order to achieve this, Anzen Protocol delivers live SF data on-chain via an economic security oracle, called the SF Oracle. SF data is then consumed by a contract called the AVS Reserves Manager in order to dynamically adjust payment fees.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c640e8-834b-4aaf-9ca5-34769911697a_4504x4000.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/0/096a7a06f4533019674ebb063b610b3f89e9456c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1liqbSl6Mr0WCBdvoT1m1eti5iY.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/0/096a7a06f4533019674ebb063b610b3f89e9456c_2_563x500.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1liqbSl6Mr0WCBdvoT1m1eti5iY\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"563\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/0/096a7a06f4533019674ebb063b610b3f89e9456c_2_563x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/0/096a7a06f4533019674ebb063b610b3f89e9456c_2_844x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/0/096a7a06f4533019674ebb063b610b3f89e9456c_2_1126x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"252146\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The SF Oracle calculates the SF for all integrated AVSs and delivers the results on-chain. Each AVS integrated with Anzen protocol has a customized SF Oracle Module which is programmed to calculate the SF for a given AVS. The SF Oracle Module queries external data sources, performs calculations and risk management computations, and returns the resulting response to the oracle, which then broadcasts all of the results on-chain. Before an SF Oracle Module is deployed, it is recommended to conduct economic security modeling and auditing.</p>\n<p>The AVS Reserves Manager is a contract that integrates with the EigenLayer AVS Payments manager to regulate the flow of AVS operator payments. With the SF now delivered on-chain, the AVS Reserves Manager is capable of increasing or decreasing the rate of operator payments in order to target a desired SF level. When there is a surplus of economic security, operator payments can be reduced to save money for the AVS. When there is a shortage of economic security, operator payments must be increased to safeguard the AVS.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"benefits-for-avss-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#benefits-for-avss-5\"></a>Benefits for AVSs</h3>\n<p>The benefits of Anzen Protocol for AVSs are clear: reduced operator payment costs and increased security. Another benefit is insight: we are building a comprehensive dashboard for AVSs to monitor and understand their AVSs economic security information in simple terms and to launch new AVSs with a clear understanding of the associated costs and requirements. The importance of contract security is also paramount; in our alpha testnet, we include rate limits in the AVS Reserves Manager for maximum security.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"testnet-deployment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#testnet-deployment-6\"></a>Testnet Deployment</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83aa8e6-de43-415a-8c07-b72beffef3b6_1600x498.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gV7DOguxRNThZjahe0O8ashNdUt.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_690x214.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gV7DOguxRNThZjahe0O8ashNdUt\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_690x214.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_1035x321.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/7/7697d53c3b29c24879ee73992d999335bc7ea869_2_1380x428.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ECEEF2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/anzen-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/Hydrogen-Labs/anzen-contracts</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"example-dashboard-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#example-dashboard-7\"></a>Example Dashboard</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75dcae16-9ef1-458d-bcad-42faa4e586ed_916x763.png\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"></a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/a6euOLAjupucMTsFDQU1zQRO8lr.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1_2_600x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"a6euOLAjupucMTsFDQU1zQRO8lr\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1_2_600x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1_2_900x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/4/46ca22c9abc4556a0df8042a2d0c538099c622d1.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1F1C1A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"links-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz#links-8\"></a>Links</h3>\n<p>Learn more about Anzen Protocol by joining our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/54bKCbAA5E\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">discord</a> community or following us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnzenProtocol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X (Twitter</a>).

Bitcoins value comes from our consensus about its role, which is dependent on its market cap. The higher it is relative to other crypto currencies, the more distinct its role is. Ethereum is different, it is valued not for it’s first-in-kind role nor for its valuation but for the activity, value, and innovation that is generated in its ecosystem. One could say that Eth has fundamental value and Bitcoin consensual value. If Ethereum closes in on Bitcoin in terms of its valuation, Bitcoins consensual value might accrue to Eth and if Bitcoin is flipped, it may lose its entire consensual value to Eth.

As someone who is an active contributor to the Sommelier protocol and also a believer in the restaking movement that Eigenlayer is pioneering, including a new restaking market for Real Yield ETH (YieldETH) would be mutually beneficial to both protocols.

It is the 4th largest yield aggregator on Ethereum and plans to go multichain in 2024. It is also quickly becoming an LST liquidity hub for assets like (w)stETH and swETH with additional LST vaults in the pipeline.</p>\n<p>Sommelier was founded by Zaki Manian and Kristi Poldsam and backed by Polychain, Multicoin Capital, Standard Crypto and others.</p>\n<p><strong>Sommelier Governance</strong><br>\nThe Sommelier protocol is governed by SOMM token holders.

The vault optimally allocates across w/stETH, cbETH and rETH and uses those assets in leveraged staking positions on Aave and Morpho and concentrated LPing on Uniswap V3. Other blue chip protocol integrations are in development.</p>\n<p>YieldETH is ERC-4626 compliant and follows a c-Token model. As a result, the relative value of YieldETH to ETH increases. While the number of YieldETH tokens remains consistent (considering no no new deposits into or withdrawals out of YieldETH), the underlying value of the ETH rises due to these rewards, prompting its value increase.</p>\n<p>There are no lockups with YieldETH and users can withdraw from the vault at any time. Future LSTs, yield strategies and DeFi protocols can be added to YieldETH through Sommelier token governance.</p>\n<p><strong>Growth and Performance</strong><br>\nThe vault has approximately ~$40M of TVL (18k ETH) and has generated ~8% organic annualized yield since launching in April. The exceptional yield performance has been driven by dynamic, monitored leveraged staking and efficient liquidity provision on Uniswap v3 (over 130 ETH in fees). The high yield performance and ERC-4626 compatibility are two factors that should drive continued growth of the vault making it an increasingly relevant TVL funnel for Eigenlayer.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/4/42ceeb59db3c40562e8df4d931b53b55d2b3a36b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9x0POoukoEDRadUbh3aFHsymiZJ.png?dl=1\" title=\"newplot (22)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/42ceeb59db3c40562e8df4d931b53b55d2b3a36b_2_517x282.png\" alt=\"newplot (22)\" data-base62-sha1=\"9x0POoukoEDRadUbh3aFHsymiZJ\" width=\"517\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/42ceeb59db3c40562e8df4d931b53b55d2b3a36b_2_517x282.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/4/42ceeb59db3c40562e8df4d931b53b55d2b3a36b_2_775x423.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/4/42ceeb59db3c40562e8df4d931b53b55d2b3a36b.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"091D15\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/6/6e17ffc4b0e8341184c558a6662fbd4b8ef4b6bb.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fHVWfIDgXp1BRd6yez93m5EkX2j.png?dl=1\" title=\"newplot (24)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/6/6e17ffc4b0e8341184c558a6662fbd4b8ef4b6bb_2_517x282.png\" alt=\"newplot (24)\" data-base62-sha1=\"fHVWfIDgXp1BRd6yez93m5EkX2j\" width=\"517\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/6/6e17ffc4b0e8341184c558a6662fbd4b8ef4b6bb_2_517x282.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/optimized/2X/6/6e17ffc4b0e8341184c558a6662fbd4b8ef4b6bb_2_775x423.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/eigenlayer/original/2X/6/6e17ffc4b0e8341184c558a6662fbd4b8ef4b6bb.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"0A1A14\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Oracles and Pricing</strong><br>\nThe YieldETH token itself does not have an oracle, but the preview functions in the smart contract report the share token price based on on-chain conditions. So, if you are wanting to determine how much WETH you would receive for 1 YieldETH, you would use previewRedeem(1e18) function.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Risks and Mitigation</strong><br>\nWhile there are synergies between Sommelier’s YieldETH and Eigenlayer, including a YieldETH restaking market does come with some risks.</p>\n<p><em>Smart Contract Risk</em><br>\nSommelier places a strong emphasis on security. However, there is still risk in the smart contracts that YieldETH uses to interact with various DeFi protocols (e.g., the Sommelier DeFi adapter to interact with Uniswap) and the underlying DeFi protocols themselves (e.g., Uniswap).</p>\n<p>To mitigate this risk, YieldETH’s smart contracts have been audited by <a href=\"https://0xmacro.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Macro</a> and only takes exposure to battle-tested protocols (such as Uniswap V3, Aave, Morpho) with extensive audits, large bug bounty programs, and histories of securing hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p><em>Underlying Asset Risk</em><br>\nYieldETH takes exposure to a basket of LSTs (such as (w)stETH, cbETH and rETH. However, since restaking markets already exist for these assets on Eigenlayer, it is assumed that the network is not taking any incremental risk on this dimension.</p>\n<p><strong>References/Useful Links</strong></p>\n<p><em>Sommelier Resources</em><br>\nSommelier Website: <a href=\"https://www.sommelier.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.sommelier.finance/</a><br>\nDapp: <a href=\"https://app.sommelier.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.sommelier.finance/</a><br>\nSommelier Protocol Docs: <a href=\"https://sommelier-finance.gitbook.io/sommelier-documentation/introduction/what-is-sommelier\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://sommelier-finance.gitbook.io/sommelier-documentation/introduction/what-is-sommelier</a><br>\nGithub: <a href=\"https://github.com/PeggyJV\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/PeggyJV</a><br>\nAudits: <a href=\"https://www.sommelier.finance/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.sommelier.finance/audits</a><br>\nBug Bounty: <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bounty/sommelier/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://immunefi.com/bounty/sommelier/</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sommfinance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/sommfinance</a><br>\nTelegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/getsomm\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://t.me/getsomm</a><br>\nDiscord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/ZcAYgSBxvY\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://discord.com/invite/ZcAYgSBxvY</a></p>\n<p><em>Real Yield ETH (YieldETH) Resources</em><br>\nYieldETH Dapp Page: <a href=\"https://app.sommelier.finance/strategies/Real-Yield-ETH/manage\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.sommelier.finance/strategies/Real-Yield-ETH/manage</a><br>\nYieldETH Blog Explainer: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sommelier.finance/real-yield-eth-is-here-to-optimize-your-eth-liquid-staking-tokens-c52f686e18ef\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://medium.com/@sommelier.finance/real-yield-eth-is-here-to-optimize-your-eth-liquid-staking-tokens-c52f686e18ef</a><br>\nToken Contract: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0xb5b29320d2Dde5BA5BAFA1EbcD270052070483ec\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://etherscan.io/token/0xb5b29320d2Dde5BA5BAFA1EbcD270052070483ec</a><br>\nAudits: <a href=\"https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits</a><br>\nBug Bounty: <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bounty/sommelier/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://immunefi.com/bounty/sommelier/</a><br>\nDashboard: <a href=\"https://ryeth.sevenseas.capital/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ryeth.sevenseas.capital/</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/new-eigenlayer-lst-real-yield-eth-yieldeth-by-sommelier/12325\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/new-eigenlayer-lst-real-yield-eth-yieldeth-by-sommelier/12325","pubDate":"Mon, 18 Dec 2023 21:14:42 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.eigenlayer.xyz-topic-12325"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/t/new-eigenlayer-lst-real-yield-eth-yieldeth-by-sommelier/12325.rss","#text":"New Eigenlayer LST: Real Yield ETH (YieldETH) by Sommelier"},"filter":false}]}}}
