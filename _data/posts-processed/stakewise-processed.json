It will also keep the distribution of rewards in V2 intact to allow users to migrate at their own pace.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"stakewise-v3-upgrade-on-gnosis-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#stakewise-v3-upgrade-on-gnosis-1\"></a>StakeWise V3 upgrade on Gnosis</h1>\n<p>As it stands, the StakeWise team is ready to release the successor to StakeWise V2 called StakeWise V3 - this time on Gnosis Chain <img src=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/images/emoji/twitter/owl.png?v=12\" title=\":owl:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":owl:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> .</p>\n<p>V3 is a liquid staking protocol that features a brand new, modular architecture that has seen great uptake on Ethereum mainnet so far - Vaults have been chosen to power MetaMask Pooled Staking, the whole ETH staking operation of our close operator partner, the staking needs of the Nexus Mutual DAO, and more. We are excited to finally deliver this architecture on Gnosis Chain, where V3 will introduce an overcollateralized LST called osGNO, and a staking marketplace where stakers can choose who runs their nodes, making Gnosis Chain more decentralized and resilient. Naturally, it also introduces all the long overdue features like withdrawals, rewards autocompounding, and permissionless participation in the protocol by home stakers and professional operators. In short, this is a whole package!</p>\n<p>With the release of StakeWise V3 on Gnosis, existing stakers will not become users of the new protocol automatically. Instead, they will continue as users of the existing version (StakeWise V2), unless they manually migrate their stake to StakeWise V3. Once they migrate, they will become a part of the Genesis Vault, which is identical to the former StakeWise Pool in terms of the fees, operators and performance.</p>\n<p>Executing the migration this way requires the StakeWise DAO to approve upgrades to the existing smart contracts and pause some others. In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transfer PoolEscrow ownership to GnoGenesisVault. PoolEscrow is currently used as the withdrawal address for StakeWise V2, and will collect GNO from the exited validators. This ownership transfer will allow the Genesis Vault to request GNO from PoolEscrow whenever users desire to unstake GNO or redeem osGNO.</li>\n<li>Upgrade V2 contracts: Oracles, Pool, RewardGnoToken, StakedGnoToken. The upgrades will allow sGNO and rGNO tokens to be burned, and let the new set of oracles control the update of rewards for those who continue to use StakeWise V2.</li>\n<li>Pause V2 contracts: PoolValidators, Pool. This will implement a freeze on new deposits into StakeWise V2, for obvious reasons.</li>\n<li>Transfer $24K of accumulated xDAI: the transfer will be made to the Genesis Vault admin, so that the team could swap it to GNO and transfer back to the PoolEscrow contract, which is under the control of the GenesisVault</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"specification-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#specification-2\"></a>Specification</h1>\n<p>See the transactions in the Snapshot below.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"considerations-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#considerations-3\"></a>Considerations</h1>\n<p>Once the DAO votes on this proposal, we will collectively open the new chapter for StakeWise and Gnosis Chain, as users of both will gain access to a flagship staking product used by the best in the industry.</p>\n<p>The proposed migration path has been audited by Sigma Prime, Halborn, and the auditors in the Hats contest.

The recently deployed Wormhole solution for allowing osETH to be easily bridged across various L2 networks has also been pre-emptively applied to SWISE to enable its expansion to Arbitrum and other L2s over time.</p>\n<p>The initial deployment carried out by the team has set a low ceiling for the total amount of SWISE that can be bridged (10,000 SWISE). The deployment has assigned the StakeWise DAO as the owner of the contracts (a standard procedure), meaning that any change in the current config must now be approved by the DAO.</p>\n<p>The team is proposing that the upper boundry for the total amount of SWISE that can be bridged is increased from 10,000 SWISE to 100,000,000 SWISE, to allow more adoption of SWISE on L2s. Without this change, bridging meaningful sums from mainnet to Arbitrum (and other L2s) in SWISE tokens will not be possible. This proposal seeks to set a sufficiently high limit to ensure that enough SWISE can circulate outside of mainnet.</p>\n<p>The second proposed edit is related to the Oracle configuration. One of the StakeWise Oracles, <a href=\"http://P2P.org\">P2P.org</a> is looking to move the Oracle endpoints to new domain names - a change related to the team’s operational decisions. Changing the Oracle endpoint has no effect on the workings of the Oracle, and does not impact anything in the StakeWise protocol. However, it still requires a DAO vote, because all the StakeWise Oracle endpoints are saved in the Oracles Config smart contract. This is security measure aimed at codifying the participants of the StakeWise Oracles set, allowing other smart contracts that rely on the Oracles’ responses to know who to listen to.</p>\n<p>Upon request from the <a href=\"http://P2P.org\">P2P.org</a> team, we are proposing that the endpoints for the P2P Oracle are changed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>v3-oracle-mainnet-1.el.p2p.world</li>\n<li>v3-oracle-mainnet-2.el.p2p.world</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"specification-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#specification-3\"></a>Specification</h2>\n<p>The following .json is used to introduce the changes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">[\n  {\n    \"to\": \"0xE3620C1aE560AF090704899aCA62209C31C4c77b\",\n    \"operation\": \"0\",\n    \"value\": \"0.0\",\n    \"data\": \"0x1901717500000000000000000000000000000000000000000052b7d2dcc80cd2e4000000\",\n    \"method\": \"setOutboundLimit(uint256)\",\n    \"params\": [\"100000000000000000000000000\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"to\": \"0x6B5815467da09DaA7DC83Db21c9239d98Bb487b5\",\n    \"operation\": \"0\",\n    \"value\": \"0.0\",\n    \"data\": \"0x8a76984d0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002e516d58334878335554424341793446546965745565536244394e506a546e5477427a4d78506450654a6779524a46000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n    \"method\": \"updateConfig(string)\",\n    \"params\": [\"QmX3Hx3UTBCAy4FTietUeSbD9NPjTnTwBzMxPdPeJgyRJF\"]\n  }\n]\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a name=\"considerations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#considerations-4\"></a>Considerations</h2>\n<p>This is a relatively straight-forward change that does not have any major impact on the StakeWise operations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"discussion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#discussion-5\"></a>Discussion</h2>\n<p>Please vote for or against the proposal in the Snapshot: <strong><a href=\"https://vote.stakewise.io/#/proposal/0x1216e1c434a3969bf68ec89807cbbfbc7d6c472c4bf662efa1c4f2449ff84d2c\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Snapshot</a></strong></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/swip-18-increase-limit-on-bridged-swise-update-p2p-oracle-config/1608\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/swip-18-increase-limit-on-bridged-swise-update-p2p-oracle-config/1608","pubDate":"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 12:42:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.stakewise.io-topic-1608"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/swip-18-increase-limit-on-bridged-swise-update-p2p-oracle-config/1608.rss","#text":"[SWIP-18] Increase Limit On Bridged SWISE & Update P2P Oracle Config"},"filter":true},{"title":"SLC Budget Request - Month 8 (Repeat)","dc:creator":"kiriyha","category":"Proposals","description":"<h1><a name=\"executive-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#executive-summary-1\"></a>Executive summary</h1>\n<p>This is a repeat proposal to provide the StakeWise Liquidity Committee (SLC) with 7,762,640 SWISE towards new liquidity incentives across our osETH pools on Balancer, Curve, and Uniswap.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>In the course of our usual business, the StakeWise Liquidity Committee periodically requests a SWISE budget from the StakeWise DAO that goes towards incentivizing the various osETH liquidity pools.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://vote.stakewise.io/#/proposal/0xdbe79e3df69a44b43bc26ae53f15d93e0a85e2fe9a4572f3ddf43db75c491cb5\"><strong>the last such proposal</strong></a> did not reach the votes quorum from the community. We partially take the blame for that - we could have done a better job advertising the vote across our channels. However, we would also like to use this repeat proposal to reiterate the importance of liquidity incentives for StakeWise, and why the SLC requests what it does from the DAO.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the importance of liquidity. It is the driving force for everything happening in the financial markets - the more of it is available, the more activity can be expected (around the instrument and more broadly).</p>\n<p>Why is it so? Having more liquidity comes down to reducing the opportunity cost of engaging with an asset  - measured in terms of slippage given a certain trade size. With more liquidity, the number of participants willing and able to engage with an asset increases, making it the go-to for new entrants drawn to more popular instruments.</p>\n<p>This relationship is often reflexive, as more liquidity is often brought to service the demand from more and ever larger players.  Long story short, liquidity sets the tone for the success of an asset, and the market in general.</p>\n<p>Coming specifically to DeFi and liquid staking protocols, liquidity for an LST is highly important for both the existing and potential new users, but also for the protocol itself. Crucial integrations like Aave, Compound, Maker, and others rely on the amount of liquidity available for an LST as an indicator of its relative safety as collateral asset in their protocols. Will the creditors who accept the LST as collateral be forced to sell it at a significant discount in case of default, or will they receive its full value? The answer depends on the amount of liquidity available to the LST in question (provided the market conditions are normal), and so more liquidity = safer asset = more integrations.</p>\n<p>As more DeFi legos are built on top of these protocols (e.g. InstaDapp for leveraged staking, on top of Aave), the relationship becomes similarly reflexive, bringing more people into the protocol as the number of integrations increases, enabling yet more integrations in the future. This has an effect on anything from the user numbers, to protocol revenue, to token price. The conclusion is that good liquidity is paramount for LSTs and liquid staking protocols on Ethereum, and we are no exception.</p>\n<p>With this backdrop, let’s address the achievements for osETH to date as well as things in the pipeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Huge Arbitrum grant received</li>\n<li>Aave, Gravita, Morpho integrations secured</li>\n<li>Compound, Spark (Maker) integrations in the works</li>\n<li>Multiple DAOs considering adding osETH to their Treasury</li>\n<li>Several critical partner integrations underway</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this traction is built upon the success of our liquidity strategy, and the StakeWise DAO support for the incentives requests made by the SLC. The SLC has been very diligent in finding the cheapest way to source liquidity, optimizing between bribes and direct rewards in order to keep expenditure to a minimum.

What we learned is that the retail side is very difficult to compete in without a restaking / airdrop angle, which is something we need to address. In contrast, the business side is showing huge promise thanks to the unique proposition of StakeWise V3.</p>\n<p>The Vaults architecture is rated very highly by the leading operators in the space, who are starting to offer Vaults as a bundled package (Vault + operator nodes) in the new deals they pursue. They are also speaking to their existing clients about the opportunity to use Vaults for streamlining the staking UX and accessing liquidity on demand.</p>\n<p>B2B cycles take months to complete, and with StakeWise V3 approaching 6 months since launch, the fruits of this side of the business are starting to show. The best thing about the B2B business is that TVL through these channels is of the highest quality and most sticky - far more valuable than mercenary capital attracted through airdrop campaigns. In short, it’s a slow process, but it is bound to be a fruitful one when it is completed.</p>\n<p>This got us thinking: instead of focusing a potential incentives program on retail users, why don’t we find a way to make StakeWise V3 even more attractive to prospective business clients?</p>\n<p>If StakeWise could accelerate its own and its partners’ sales effort by understanding clients’ migration pains, and made it a priority to solve them, it could bring significant new inflows into the protocol and further validate the strength of our Vaults architecture.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what the StakeWise Incentivized Migration Program is about: its goal is to make it easier for both our partners and their clients to initiate staking through Vaults, or migrate to Vaults, in order to access new features we unlock for them and grow StakeWise TVL in the process. It also lets operators benefit from the success of this endeavor, and incentivizes them to sell Vaults more aggressively to new prospects.</p>\n<p>In practice, we propose that the Incentivized Migration Program does three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>compensate any migrating clients for the ETH rewards they lose during validator exits and re-registration,</li>\n<li>cover the costs of setting up new validators for the operator, and</li>\n<li>issue a $SWISE bonus (vested) to the operator for every migrated / new ETH stake in Vaults.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given our Treasury’s size and the expected cost of the migration process, this initiative has the capacity to bring up to 2M ETH into StakeWise Vaults by using up to 50M SWISE and 1,000 ETH. Should we reach this capacity, we will have put our Treasury to a very good use and significantly changed the market dynamics in our favour. See the details of the proposed program in the Implementation section below.</p>\n<p>We initiated conversations with our partners about this very program in early April, and are now starting to see the first successful responses from clients. This actually prompted us to propose the program sooner, because we would like to have full certainty that the StakeWise DAO is on board with the program before more capital is committed.</p>\n<p>To conclude, we believe that the StakeWise Incentivized Migration Program would allow us to accelerate the B2B efforts of our team and our partners, attract significant TVL, and make sure that our Treasury funds are put to good use. We now seek your support in making this program official.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#implementation-3\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<p>New Clients - StakeWise to reward partner operators with 25 SWISE for each ETH staked, up to a total of 1M ETH[1].</p>\n<p>Existing Clients - StakeWise to cover the lost yield associated with the migration of 1M ETH[2], provide a 25 SWISE bonus to operators for each ETH staked, and cover the gas costs associated with spinning up new validators[3] for existing clients[4].</p>\n<p>At current market prices, the max possible SWISE bonus for an operator over both the New and Existing Client programs is $2,000,000 paid in SWISE[5] for a total of 2M ETH staked.</p>\n<p>Client reimbursements would be paid in ETH directly into client Vaults by passing the client’s address as the receiver parameter via the deposit function (<a href=\"https://docs.stakewise.io/for-developers/stake#depositing\">see documents</a> for more information). A single payment would be made by StakeWise on behalf of each client, with payments made at the end of each week.</p>\n<p>ETH payments to operators would be made every 3 months to cover validator registration gas costs[3].</p>\n<p>A vesting contract would be deployed by the StakeWise team every 3 months on behalf of operators for the total amount of $SWISE earned over the previous 3 months. This SWISE would be linearly vested for 3 months.</p>\n<p>The team will periodically request ETH and SWISE from the DAO Treasury to process the payments.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"terms-and-conditions-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#terms-and-conditions-4\"></a>Terms and Conditions</h1>\n<p>[1] The new client bonus is strictly for new clients of both the operator and StakeWise.</p>\n<p>[2] Each successful deposit will receive ~10 days worth of staking yield assuming an APY of 3.5%, paid in ETH to the client’s Vault (i.e. 0.001 ETH per 1 ETH staked).</p>\n<p>[3] The exact gas fees associated with validator registrations for all eligible deposits will be returned to the operator at the end of the program. Note, a maximum of 0.008 ETH will be paid per validator registration (representing the expected cost at 30 GWEI base fee).</p>\n<p>[4] The ETH yield reimbursement and the validator gas cost reimbursement is strictly for existing clients of the operator that migrate to StakeWise.

At the current SWISE price, this means ca 11,500,000 extra SWISE emitted over the 9-month period.</p>\n<p>The decision on the commitment for this amount of incentives is solely in the hands of the StakeWise DAO.</p>\n<p>Given the additional incentives contributed by the Arbitrum Foundation, and the growth prospects unlocked by an aggressive osETH expansion to Arbitrum, the team believes that matching the incentives would be the right move.</p>\n<p>The deployment and the grant provide StakeWise with a new growth impulse, and an extra 3 months for restoring momentum and helping reduce the incentives burden on the SWISE token. Without the grant, StakeWise would need to pursue expansion to Arbitrum with its own efforts, which is likely to be significantly more costly.</p>\n<p>In light of these considerations, we believe that accepting the grant and matching the incentives is a great way to get osETH started on Arbitrum, and urge DAO members to vote in favour of the proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#implementation-3\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<p>At this time, no technical implementation is necessary.

Ok having deep liquidity is important but that doesnt fuel the growth of the protocol effectively in its current form.</p>\n<p>This is what im thinking:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Incentivize Vault Operators</strong></p>\n<p>So instead of incentivizing user deposits we should give incentivizes for vault operators, where they receive SWISE rewards for increasing their TVL in their individuals Vaults.</p>\n<p>You want to make them ambassadors of your protocols and have them try the hardest to increase their own vaults TVL.</p>\n<p>Any other incentives will likely just get farmed and dumped. (Vault operators are alinged and might not dump as much as mercenary yield farmers)</p>\n<p>This incentivization does not need be build in a complex smart contract way, a simple frontend in a leaderboard style design which tracks the $$$ increase for each vault, and show that lets stay 10k$ USD of rewards per Week up for grabs and to be distributed to the top 10 vault operators. (Top 10 highest $$$ value increase)</p>\n<p>(Reward size needs to be high, so there is a real incentive for current operators but also for new operator to enter !)</p>\n<p>I truely think this could fuel a lot of growth!</p>\n<p>Excited for your feedback ! <img src=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/stakewise-vault-incentives/1438\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/stakewise-vault-incentives/1438","pubDate":"Tue, 30 Jan 2024 19:06:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.stakewise.io-topic-1438"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/stakewise-vault-incentives/1438.rss","#text":"Stakewise Vault Incentives"},"filter":false},{"title":"Incentivizing the launch of osETH on Morpho Blue","dc:creator":"Jstar","category":"Proposals","description":"<h2><a name=\"what-is-morpho-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#what-is-morpho-1\"></a>What is Morpho?</h2>\n<p>Morpho initially launched as a <a href=\"https://aavev2.morpho.org/?network=mainnet\">decentralized lending protocol</a>, acting as a peer-to-peer matching algorithm on top of both Aave and Compound, improving the lending and borrowing rates whilst preserving the same liquidity and risk parameters. Morpho has recently launched Morpho Blue, a protocol upgrade that is analogous to StakeWise V3, where Morpho allows anyone to launch lending markets in a fully permissionless manner. Each lending market is isolated, reducing the cross-asset risks that exist with large, multi-asset lending pools like Aave V2.</p>\n<p>Morpho Blue has a risk management layer that allows Risk Advisors to launch Vaults and select their preferred lending markets. These Vaults act as a channel to funnel assets in and out of each individual lending market, with the Risk Advisor managing how the capital is allocated. A diagram comparing the Morpho Blue approach compared to that of Aave/Compound is found below.

Over 1.5M stETH has been supplied to Aave, with the majority used for leveraged staking. Several structured products are built specifically on top of this use-case and leveraged staking in general has acted as an important growth pathway for Lido. StakeWise DAO will continue to pursue a listing for osETH on leading lending markets like Aave and Compound, however the ability to unlock such an important use-case for osETH ahead of these integrations cannot be understated.</p>\n<p>The StakeWise team has been in discussions with various Risk Advisors on Morpho Blue to ensure that any osETH-ETH lending market is included into their Vaults, acting as a central distribution channel of capital and ensuring the osETH market gains traction. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Re7Capital\">Re7 Capital</a> will be creating a Vault to target LSTs that are not currently adopted by major lending protocols. They have outlined their vision on the <a href=\"https://forum.morpho.org/t/re7-labs-lst-backed-eth-metamorpho-vault-whitelisting/427\">Morpho forums</a> and have committed to include osETH as part of their Vault launch in the coming weeks. This will best position the osETH market to receive capital and ensure any incentives used to boot-strap it are put to good use.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"why-incentivise-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#why-incentivise-3\"></a>Why Incentivise?</h2>\n<p>Without ETH supplied to the osETH-ETH market, there will be no capital for osETH holders to borrow against. Just like with Aave and Compound during their initial launch, Morpho requires the incentivization of the supply side across these various markets to bootstrap the ecosystem. Once there is a healthy supply and borrow across a market, they become self-sustainable and are no longer in need of incentives. Lido launched their stETH-ETH market earlier this month and have committed over $300k of incentives over the next 3 months to help bootstrap the stETH market.</p>\n<p>We have worked closely with the Morpho team and various Risk Advisors to design an optimal bootstrapping campaign, with the aim to distribute $45k over a 3-month period to kickstart the osETH-ETH market. That equates to a total of 900k SWISE, or 300k per month. For context, the DAO currently spends around 600k SWISE per month to incentivize the SWISE-ETH liquidity pool. The DAO is responsible for the liquidity and integrations of osETH, and as such, the DAO should view this cost as analogous to the liquidity incentives it pays. These incentives will be deployed by the Morpho team as described <a href=\"https://forum.morpho.org/t/standardized-method-for-distributing-incentives-on-morpho-blue-markets/412\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Morpho are ‘matching’ incentives with their upcoming token, $MORPHO.

Motivation:</strong></p>\n<p>I believe StakeWise DAO is very serious about its Governance Process and involving community in making key decisions as evidently by the amount of work to do it.</p>\n<p>I’m a co-founder of Syncvote. I believe our tool can add tangible value to the implementation of StakeWise DAO’s governance process without any changes to the current setup. The goal is to let admins and members focus on making decisions instead of getting lost in tech stuff.</p>\n<p>I previously raised a discussion on the forum (here: <a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/automated-workflow-for-stakewise/1259\">Automated workflow for StakeWise Dao</a>) and upgraded our products continuously during the discussion, so I decided to start this thread to make a better presentation on how StakeWise DAO can benefit from Syncvote. If this is something interesting, I would like to take this to the next phase.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Problem Now:</strong></p>\n<p>I see 3 existing problems in implementing StakeWise DAO governance process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The proposer must remember all the technical details of the governance process to avoid making miStakeWises.</li>\n<li>The proposer has to bounce around different platforms, such as StakeWise, for each step of the process.</li>\n<li>Any solution that could potentially consolidate everything into one platform for consistency and ease of navigation would require the DAO to abandon its current setup and adopt a new one.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3. How We Solve It:</strong></p>\n<p>Syncvote provides a chrome extension. It works as a unified front-end for any DAO member that wants to make a proposal to StakeWise DAO. It acts like a central hub, no more bouncing between different platforms. Members can kick off and handle proposals, watch progress, and move through stages – all in one interface.</p>\n<p>Why Syncvote will fit nicely into the current StakeWise DAO practice:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Non-invasive, there isn’t any new platform to familiarize with, just open the extension and click “start new proposal” to start.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The extension works with all the platforms DAO has been using, so you don’t need to make any changes to your current setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It’s free, our goal is to eventually put every DAO to operate completely on-chain, so until StakeWise DAO decides to write data on-chain; it won’t cost you anything.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My cofounder’s created this video to illustrate how the plugin works for a DAO: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/5f18dbdaa1a942298a24d1a82fa738a8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Syncvote Demo</a></p>\n<p><strong>4. Next Steps to Implement:</strong></p>\n<p>To implement this transformative solution for StakeWise DAO, we propose the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After the proposal has been passed, I will convert the StakeWise Governance Process into a format compatible with Syncvote. An administrator/coreteam member can help me to follow-up and also check its accuracy.</li>\n<li>After that, StakeWise DAO will start announcing to community members on forum, announcement channels on discord and twitter etc., that they can start using Syncvote extension to make new proposals from then on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion, I see this as a straightforward implementation that helps to smooth governance experience for StakeWise DAO community members. I would be grateful if StakeWise DAO adopts Syncvote.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading my post. I would like to have your feedback on this topic.</p>\n<p>Godwin.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/proposal-solution-to-improve-dao-governance-efficiency/1413\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/proposal-solution-to-improve-dao-governance-efficiency/1413","pubDate":"Wed, 27 Dec 2023 10:00:01 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.stakewise.io-topic-1413"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.stakewise.io/t/proposal-solution-to-improve-dao-governance-efficiency/1413.rss","#text":"Proposal: Solution to Improve DAO Governance Efficiency"},"filter":false},{"title":"SLC Budget Request - Month 3","dc:creator":"Jstar","category":"Proposals","description":"<h2><a name=\"intro-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#intro-1\"></a>Intro</h2>\n<p>This is a proposal to allocate SWISE from the StakeWise DAO Community Treasury to the StakeWise Liquidity Committee to be used solely to incentivise the liquidity ecosystems of all StakeWise tokens.

Liquidity generation for osETH has been fast and effective, allowing for our partner Redstone to begin work on creating an osETH-ETH Price Oracle without delay. This Price Oracle is due to go live before the end of the year and enable the next set of integrations for osETH.</p>\n<p>SWISE emissions have also been well managed and ultimately reduced throughout the transition period. This reduction is in part due to the reduced amount of liquidity for osETH compared to sETH2, but more importantly, the quality of liquidity is greatly improved alongside the capital efficiency of incentives.

It will also keep the distribution of rewards in V2 intact to allow users to migrate at their own pace.</p>\n<h1>\n<a name=\"stakewise-v3-upgrade-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.stakewise.io#stakewise-v3-upgrade-2\"></a>StakeWise V3 upgrade</h1>\n<p>As it stands, the StakeWise team is ready to release the successor to StakeWise V2 called StakeWise V3.</p>\n<p>It’s a liquid staking protocol that features a brand new architecture, which has been praised for its versatility and potential to uphold the status quo in the staking market. It introduces an overcollateralized LST called osETH, and a staking marketplace where stakers can choose who runs their nodes and operators can join without permission to attract deposits and stake their own capital. It is a significant upgrade for the existing product of the StakeWise DAO, and an important step for the continued growth of the protocol.</p>\n<p>With the release of StakeWise V3, existing stakers will not become users of the new protocol automatically. Instead, they will continue as users of the existing version (StakeWise V2), unless they manually migrate their stake to StakeWise V3. Once they migrate, they will become a part of the Genesis Vault, which is identical to the former StakeWise Pool in terms of the fees, operators and performance. For the full details of the migration, take a look at this updated <a href=\"https://stakewise.medium.com/transitioning-to-stakewise-v3-the-migration-plan-f44d7602e955\">blogpost</a>.</p>\n<p>Executing the migration this way requires the StakeWise DAO to approve upgrades to the existing smart contracts and pause some others. In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transfer PoolEscrow ownership to EthGenesisVault. PoolEscrow is currently used as the withdrawal address for StakeWise V2, and will collect ETH from the exited validators. This ownership transfer will allow the Genesis Vault to request ETH from PoolEscrow whenever users desire to unstake ETH or redeem osETH.</li>\n<li>Upgrade V2 contracts: Oracles, Pool, RewardEthToken, StakedEthToken.
