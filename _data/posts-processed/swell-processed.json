This process is facilitated through a public forum and involves several stages, including drafting the proposal, gathering community feedback, conducting a preliminary check, preparing the final proposal, voting, and finally, implementing the proposal if it passes.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-1-drafting-the-proposal-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-1-drafting-the-proposal-1\"></a>1. Drafting the Proposal</h4>\n<p>The first step is to prepare a 1-2 page proposal. You can use the proposal template from the <a href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/c/guidelines-resources/\">Ressources</a> or look at previously accepted proposals for inspiration. If your proposal requires participation from other stakeholders, it’s important to consult with them at this stage.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-community-feedback-temperature-check-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-2-community-feedback-temperature-check-2\"></a>2. Community Feedback &amp; Temperature Check</h4>\n<p>Once your proposal is ready, post it on the forum to initiate a feedback period. You should allow at least 7 days for feedback. During this time, you can participate in governance calls, present your idea, and engage with delegates to discuss the potential impact of your proposal.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-3-preparing-final-proposal-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-3-preparing-final-proposal-3\"></a>3. Preparing Final Proposal</h4>\n<p>After gathering feedback, compile it into a single proposal and prepare to submit it for the final vote. At this stage, you may need to contact the Swell Foundation, especially if your proposal is seeking funds from the SwellDAO’s treasury. You may need to complete KYC/KYB procedures, sign a grant agreement, and discuss any assistance required from the Swell Foundation.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-4-final-voting-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-4-final-voting-4\"></a>4. Final Voting</h4>\n<p>If you believe your proposal stands a chance after incorporating feedback, ask a delegate to put it up for an official vote via the off-chain platform on Snapshot. You may also need to contact the Swell Foundation to complete all compliance and documentation checks.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-5-outcome-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-5-outcome-5\"></a>5. Outcome</h4>\n<p>If your proposal passes, congratulations! If not, don’t be disheartened. Revisit the feedback from delegates and consider rethinking the scope of your proposal.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposal-considerations-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#proposal-considerations-6\"></a>Proposal Considerations</h3>\n<p>To increase the chances of your proposal being accepted, consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objective and Rationale</strong>: Explain why your proposal is important for the community, how you determined the need for this grant, and who will benefit from it.</li>\n<li><strong>Team and Qualifications</strong>: Identify the people working on the proposal and their qualifications. Ensure you’ve consulted with relevant stakeholders before posting it on the forum.</li>\n<li><strong>Budget</strong>: Justify the specific amount you’re asking for, provide a breakdown of how the budget will be used, and outline the payment schedule for releasing funds to the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Implementation Plan</strong>: Detail how you’ll ensure the proposal achieves its goal, your step-by-step plan or milestones, potential risks and mitigation strategies, and how you’ll measure success.</li>\n<li><strong>Engagement with SwellDAO</strong>: Plan how you’ll keep the SwellDAO updated about the project’s progression, how the community can provide feedback, and whether the SwellDAO can halt the release of further funds if the proposal is not going to plan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, once a proposal is passed by the SwellDAO, the community has endorsed and approved your proposal. The delegates are now your biggest supporters, and it’s important to leverage this community to help achieve your intended outcome and ensure the project’s success. If your proposal requires involvement from the Swell Foundation, contact <a href=\"mailto:info@swellnetwork.io\">info@swell.foundation</a>. The Swell Foundation does not endorse any pending proposals, but it’s always willing to help when needed and to operationally support proposals passed by the SwellDAO.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/proposal-lifecycle/1302\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/proposal-lifecycle/1302","pubDate":"Fri, 17 May 2024 14:54:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"Yes","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.swellnetwork.io-topic-1302"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/proposal-lifecycle/1302.rss","#text":"Proposal Lifecycle"},"filter":false},{"title":"Community Guidelines","dc:creator":"Chris_Swell","category":"Guidelines & Resources","description":"<h3><a name=\"welcome-to-the-swell-forum-a-place-for-respectful-public-interaction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#welcome-to-the-swell-forum-a-place-for-respectful-public-interaction-1\"></a>Welcome to the Swell Forum, a Place for Respectful Public Interaction</h3>\n<p>We invite you to treat this discussion platform with the same regard you would a communal park. Like a park, we are a shared resource for the community — a space to exchange expertise, insights, and passions through continuous dialogue. These aren’t rigid rules, but rather suggestions to assist our community’s human judgment and maintain this as a neat and welcoming space for respectful public discourse.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"enhance-the-conversation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#enhance-the-conversation-2\"></a>Enhance the Conversation</h4>\n<p>Help us shape this into an excellent platform for discussion by consistently striving to enrich the conversation, no matter how minor your contribution may be. If you’re uncertain whether your post contributes to the discussion, contemplate your message and consider posting later. The subjects discussed here are important to us, and we hope you treat them with the same importance. Show respect for the topics and the individuals discussing them, even if you find yourself disagreeing with some of the views expressed. One method to enrich the conversation is by exploring ongoing discussions. Spend time navigating the topics here before responding or initiating your own, and you’ll likely find others who share your interests.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"maintain-cordiality-even-in-disagreement-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#maintain-cordiality-even-in-disagreement-3\"></a>Maintain Cordiality, Even in Disagreement</h4>\n<p>You might feel compelled to respond by expressing disagreement. That’s perfectly acceptable. However, remember to critique ideas, not individuals. Please refrain from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insults</li>\n<li>Personal attacks</li>\n<li>Reacting to a post’s tone rather than its actual content</li>\n<li>Impulsive contradiction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead, offer well-thought-out counter-arguments that enhance the conversation.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"your-involvement-matters-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#your-involvement-matters-4\"></a>Your Involvement Matters</h4>\n<p>The dialogues we engage in here establish the tone for all newcomers. Help us shape the future of this community by choosing to participate in discussions that make this forum an engaging place to be — and steering clear of those that do not. Swell offers tools that allow the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so on. Utilize these tools to enhance your own experience, as well as that of others. Let’s strive to leave our community in a better state than we found it.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"if-you-spot-an-issue-flag-it-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#if-you-spot-an-issue-flag-it-5\"></a>If You Spot an Issue, Flag It</h4>\n<p>While moderators hold special authority and are accountable for this forum, so are you. With your assistance, moderators can serve as community facilitators, not merely custodians or enforcers. If you witness inappropriate behavior, refrain from responding. Responding only validates the inappropriate behavior, drains your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Simply flag it. If a post accumulates enough flags, action will be taken, either automatically or through moderator intervention. To preserve our community, moderators have the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators assume no responsibility for any content posted by the community.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"always-maintain-decorum-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#always-maintain-decorum-6\"></a>Always Maintain Decorum</h4>\n<p>Nothing undermines a healthy conversation more than impoliteness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be courteous. Avoid posting anything that a reasonable person would deem offensive, abusive, or hate speech.</li>\n<li>Keep it appropriate. Refrain from posting anything obscene or sexually explicit.</li>\n<li>Respect one another. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate individuals, or disclose their private information.</li>\n<li>Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or vandalize the forum in any way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These aren’t rigid terms with precise definitions — steer clear of even the hint of any of these behaviors. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major newspaper. This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Ensure the language, links, and images are suitable for family and friends.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"keep-it-organized-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#keep-it-organized-7\"></a>Keep It Organized</h4>\n<p>Make an effort to keep things in their proper place, so we can devote more time to discussion and less to cleanup. So:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t initiate a topic in the wrong category.</li>\n<li>Don’t duplicate the same post across multiple topics.</li>\n<li>Don’t post replies with no content.</li>\n<li>Don’t derail a topic by altering its course midway.</li>\n<li>Don’t sign your posts — each post is already linked to your profile information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead of posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than veering an existing topic in a drastically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"post-only-your-own-content-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#post-only-your-own-content-8\"></a>Post Only Your Own Content</h4>\n<p>You may not post any digital content that belongs to someone else without their permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for violating any other law. These are the community guidelines for Swell. Let’s work together to create a respectful and engaging environment for all.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/community-guidelines/1300\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/community-guidelines/1300","pubDate":"Fri, 17 May 2024 14:18:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"Yes","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.swellnetwork.io-topic-1300"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/community-guidelines/1300.rss","#text":"Community Guidelines"},"filter":false},{"title":"Governance Framework","dc:creator":"Chris_Swell","category":"Guidelines & Resources","description":"<h3><a name=\"h-1-daos-mission-and-vision-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-1-daos-mission-and-vision-1\"></a><strong>1. DAO’s Mission and Vision</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Swell’s mission is to revolutionize the liquid staking landscape by making it more inclusive and accessible, thereby empowering a broader range of participants in the DeFi sector. We are dedicated to advancing network security, promoting resistance to censorship, and encouraging active community governance, particularly within the Layer 2 framework. Our commitment lies in driving innovation to unlock the liquidity of staked assets, ensuring that our protocol offers robust security, versatility, and the potential for widespread adoption. By introducing rswETH, we aim to expand the utility and capabilities of our ecosystem, fostering an environment that is both inclusive and participatory. Swell is poised to set a new standard for liquid staking and restaking, transforming the PoS ecosystems and offering new opportunities for yield enhancement and network support through our restaking solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-membership-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-2-membership-2\"></a>2. Membership</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Membership in the Swell DAO means being part of a diverse and inclusive community committed to democratizing the liquid staking market. As a member, you are actively involved in governance, contributing to discussions, and shaping the future of Layer 2. Membership also entails holding SWELL, a token that represents your stake and influence within our DAO and the broader restaking ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-roles-and-responsibilities-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-3-roles-and-responsibilities-3\"></a><strong>3. Roles and Responsibilities</strong></h3>\n<p>In the Swell DAO, we have established a robust structure of roles and responsibilities to ensure smooth operations, effective decision-making, and active community involvement. These roles, which include Panels and the Community Manager, are integral to our mission.</p>\n<p><strong>a) Community Manager</strong></p>\n<p>Community Manager are central figures in our DAO. Their responsibilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Checking and moderating proposals</strong>: The Community Manager ensures that all proposals align with the mission and values of our DAO. They review each proposal for relevance, feasibility, and potential impact on our community and operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Forum moderation</strong>: The Community Manager is also in charge of moderating our forum. They foster a respectful and productive environment for discussion, collaboration, and decision-making among our community members.</li>\n<li><strong>Establishing workflow</strong>: Beyond moderation duties, the Community Manager plays a significant role in establishing and managing the workflow within our DAO. They coordinate tasks, manage timelines, and ensure that our operations run smoothly and efficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>b) Delegates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delegates represent the interests of token holders and vote on their behalf in a governance system. By delegating tokens, holders transfer their voting power to a trusted delegate while retaining ownership of their tokens. Choosing a delegate is an important decision, as it ensures that the collective interests of token holders are considered in governance decisions. Delegating tokens allows holders to participate in the governance process without the need for direct involvement in voting or monitoring activities. Ultimately, delegates play a crucial role in ensuring a fair and inclusive governance system for $SWELL holders.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"h-4-voting-system-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-4-voting-system-4\"></a>4. Voting System</h3>\n<p>In the Swell DAO, we recognize the critical role that a robust and transparent voting system plays in effective collective decision-making. As such, we have chosen to implement Snapshot, a platform renowned for its off-chain voting capabilities, as our primary voting system.</p>\n<p><strong>a) Voting Power Unit</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The foundation of governance power in our DAO is the $SWELL token. This token serves as the primary means for members to gain voting power.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>b) Voting with Snapshot</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snapshot offers a user-friendly interface and is built with transparency in mind, making it an ideal choice for our DAO. One of its key advantages is that it allows our members to vote on proposals without incurring gas fees, thereby encouraging broader participation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>c) Delegation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snapshot also supports delegation, which allows members to delegate their voting power to others. This feature provides flexibility and ensures that every member’s voice can be heard, even if they are unable to participate in every vote.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"h-5-proposal-management-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-5-proposal-management-5\"></a><strong>5. Proposal Management</strong></h3>\n<p>In Swell DAO, we understand the significance of efficient proposal management. It is crucial to ensure that only viable and well-supported ideas are considered. To facilitate this, we have established clear guidelines for submitting, discussion, voting and implementation of proposals.</p>\n<p><strong>a) Submission Guidelines</strong></p>\n<p>The proposal management process begins with submission. Any member can initiate a proposal in the Forum. Proposals should be clear, concise, and include a detailed plan of action. This ensures that all members understand the proposal and its implications.</p>\n<p><strong>b) Review and Discussion Period</strong></p>\n<p>Once a proposal is submitted, it enters a mandatory discussion period. This period allows members to review the proposal, ask questions, and share their perspectives. We believe that open and thorough discussion is crucial for informed decision-making. Therefore, each proposal must be discussed for a minimum period of 7 days before it is put to a vote.</p>\n<p><strong>c) Voting and Tracking Proposals</strong></p>\n<p>After the discussion period, the proposal is put to a vote using our Snapshot voting system. Any member, who holds a minimum of 10k $SWELL, can initiate a vote there. Members can track the status of proposals through Snapshot, which provides real-time updates on the voting process.</p>\n<p>d) <strong>Approval and Implementation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A quorum of more than 5% of the total supply is needed for a vote to be valid. This requirement ensures broad participation and prevents decision-making by a small minority.</li>\n<li>A simple majority is required for a proposal to be approved. This means that more than 50% of the votes cast must be in favor of the proposal. Once a proposal is approved, it will be implemented.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"h-6-emergency-functions-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-6-emergency-functions-6\"></a>6. Emergency Functions</h3>\n<p>In the Swell DAO, we understand the importance of being prepared for emergencies to ensure effective handling of unexpected situations. To this end, we have developed emergency protocols for handling security breaches, financial crises, or significant operational disruptions.</p>\n<p><strong>a) Protocol Guardians</strong></p>\n<p>A key component of our emergency preparedness are our Protocol Guardians. This team is composed of experienced members who are trained to handle emergency situations. They are responsible for activating our emergency measures and coordinating our response efforts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Protocol Guardians comprise individuals with extensive experience and a proven track record of trustworthiness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>b) Accelerated Proposals</strong></p>\n<p>In certain emergency situations, we recognize the need for swift decision-making. Therefore, we have a provision to accelerate proposals and bypass the usual forum discussion. These accelerated proposals can be put by Protocol Guardians directly into Snapshot for voting, ensuring that we can take quick action when necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>c) Veto Rights</strong></p>\n<p>In the event that the proposal pertains to elementary elements of the Swell protocol (L2, LST, LRT) the Protocol Guardians are afforded the prerogative to veto the proposal even after the community has given its consent. In such instances, the proposal can be resubmitted to the forum, thereby allowing for the reopening of the discussion.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-7-swell-improvement-proposal-swip-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io#h-7-swell-improvement-proposal-swip-7\"></a>7.  Swell Improvement Proposal (SWIP)</h3>\n<p>The Swell Improvement Proposal (SWIP) is a formalized process for making changes to the Swell DAO.

How do I understand how many points I received, how can I make sure that everything is counted correctly for me?</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/swell-eth-magpie-sweth-swell-l2-msweth-does-not-show-points-in-portfolio/929\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/swell-eth-magpie-sweth-swell-l2-msweth-does-not-show-points-in-portfolio/929","pubDate":"Wed, 24 Apr 2024 03:03:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.swellnetwork.io-topic-929"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/swell-eth-magpie-sweth-swell-l2-msweth-does-not-show-points-in-portfolio/929.rss","#text":"Swell (ETH) -> Magpie (swETH) -> Swell L2 (mswETH) does not show points in portfolio"},"filter":false},{"title":"Unstaking Queue Not Processing","dc:creator":"metana","category":"Ecosystem","description":"<p>It seems like unstaking queue has stopped processing and not a single withdrawal has been finalized in more than last 48 hours, can someone please explain what is the cause of this?</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/unstaking-queue-not-processing/888\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/unstaking-queue-not-processing/888","pubDate":"Mon, 22 Apr 2024 09:06:49 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.swellnetwork.io-topic-888"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/unstaking-queue-not-processing/888.rss","#text":"Unstaking Queue Not Processing"},"filter":false},{"title":"Unstake swETH - Pending after 14 days","dc:creator":"toannguyen","category":"Ecosystem","description":"<p><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/swellnetwork/original/1X/a200ac3354e8f6abd4da43d5ff09dc82f78322ce.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"n78N439TgWIQNPKaezBeIxCTYT4\" width=\"676\" height=\"240\"><br>\nI have unstaked my swETH for 14 days now, but it still not back to my metamask wallet yet.
