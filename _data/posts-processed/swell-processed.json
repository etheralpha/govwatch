Truly  a new chapter is being written in the crypto history books. However, I am unable to participate in the L2 restaking initiative…Tried all possible options: accessing the page via link from <a href=\"http://ether.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ether.fi</a>, or directly via the Swell website doesnt make any difference. I have tried to restake ETH as well as rswETH; same result. After specifying what and  how much, I hit the yellow approve button. On the screen a small window appears to the bottom left “Approve pending” , it has a yellow bar showing the progress,but doesnt move,  and times out after some minutes. Trying with ETH instead of rswETH same result, the only difference is that the yellow button has “zap in” instead of “approve” and the appearing small window changes from “Approve pending” to “zap pending”. …please advice, spent hours trying to get this to work…  Regards B</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/l2-restaking-not-working/1196\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/l2-restaking-not-working/1196","pubDate":"Sat, 11 May 2024 13:03:04 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.swellnetwork.io-topic-1196"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/l2-restaking-not-working/1196.rss","#text":"L2 restaking not working"},"filter":false},{"title":"Can't withdraw weETH token from swell L2","dc:creator":"gyengej","category":"General","description":"<p>I made a weETH deposit on the swell L2, but I can’t withdraw it</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/cant-withdraw-weeth-token-from-swell-l2/1176\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/cant-withdraw-weeth-token-from-swell-l2/1176","pubDate":"Thu, 09 May 2024 15:17:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.swellnetwork.io-topic-1176"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.swellnetwork.io/t/cant-withdraw-weeth-token-from-swell-l2/1176.rss","#text":"Can't withdraw weETH token from swell L2"},"filter":false},{"title":"Eligible for Eigenlayer-Points if withdrawn and then deposited again","dc:creator":"Digarre","category":"General","description":"<p>Hello all!</p>\n<p>I deposited some eth in the pre launch deposit where it was locked for 30 days.
