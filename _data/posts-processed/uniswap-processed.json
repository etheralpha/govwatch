After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702\">https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702</a></p>\n<p>Incorporating these findings, the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative–Cycle 1 was <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-uniswap-delegate-reward-3-months-cycle-1/23837\">proposed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/64\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">launched</a> in June 2024.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53572-success-of-cycle-1-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53572-success-of-cycle-1-4\"></a>Success of Cycle 1</h2>\n<p>The 12 delegates that were selected under Cycle 1 maintained 100% voting participation rate for both offchain and onchain votes during this period. In addition, the Delegate Reward Initiative discussion attracted several new delegates.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>New Delegate Name</th>\n<th>Delegate Join Date</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>SEEDGov</td>\n<td>May 2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Curia</td>\n<td>June 2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tané</td>\n<td>June 2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bobbay</td>\n<td>July 2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Whetstone</td>\n<td>July 2024</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"p-53572-learnings-from-cycle-1-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53572-learnings-from-cycle-1-5\"></a>Learnings from Cycle 1</h2>\n<p>While Cycle 1 was simple and effective, there were several suggestions to have a tier system to incorporate different participation levels of delegates. In addition, various suggestions were shared on how to make a points system to determine the top delegate applicants more fair and objective.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53572-cycle-2-proposal-details-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53572-cycle-2-proposal-details-6\"></a>Cycle 2 Proposal Details</h2>\n<p><strong>Application Eligibility</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There will be a week-long period for delegate candidates to submit their applications.

Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile.</p>\n<p>2b. Attend Uniswap Community Calls.</p>\n<p>Achieving these above will provide an additional up $3,000 USD worth of $UNI.For 2a and 2b, it allows proportional payment. For example, if there were 4 votings and 1 community call, and a delegate missed to write a rationale of 2 of the votings. The delegate would be eligible to receive $1800 [3/5 * $3000].</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53572-uniswap-delegate-reward-cycle-2-metrics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53572-uniswap-delegate-reward-cycle-2-metrics-7\"></a>Uniswap Delegate Reward Cycle 2 Metrics</h2>\n<p>In case there are more than 15 eligible applicants, the top 15 will be chosen by the following objective metrics. The highest number of available point would be 10.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Voting Participation</strong></p>\n<p>-Considering one of the primary roles of the delegate is to receive voting power from their delegators to vote on behalf for the best of Uniswap, voting participation is crucial to ensure quorums are met and malicious proposals are prevented. The total point amount from this category is 6. The onchain part is weighted more heavily due to its usual frictions such as gas cost, as well as its ability to dictate governance contract alterations and movement of treasury funds. The voting rate is based on the past 6 months.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Offchain Voting (Snapshot)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>80% and above : 2</li>\n<li>70% till 80% : 1.5</li>\n<li>60% till 70%: 1</li>\n<li>50% or below but above 0%: 0.5</li>\n<li>0% : 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>2. Onchain Voting</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>80% and above : 3</li>\n<li>70% till 80% : 2.25</li>\n<li>60% till 70%: 1.5</li>\n<li>50% or below but above 0%: 0.75</li>\n<li>0% : 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3. The date of the first on chain vote is 3 months or more (this is to counterbalance very new applicants who have few votes and able to get full points on the voting)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yes : 1</li>\n<li>No : 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>2. Proposal Authorship</strong></p>\n<p>-Helping to write proposals for Uniswap DAO is important. However, we also want to prevent low-quality or malicious proposals. Therefore, only passed votes would count. The total points for this category is 3. The onchain part is weighted more heavily once again.</p>\n<p>In case of non-binary proposals, if the choice equivalent to “No” was present, and the end voting result was another choice than “No”, then it would be considered as valid for below. For example, Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) Election wouldn’t be valid for the points as there’s no “No” vote . But [Temp] Uni Onboarding Package - BSC would be valid for the points as there was a choice of “Against”. And the voting result was “$1m”.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed offchain (snapshot) vote before.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yes, 2 or more : 1</li>\n<li>Yes, 1 : 0.5</li>\n<li>No: 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>2.Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed onchain vote before</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Yes, 2 or more : 2</li>\n<li>Yes, 1 : 1</li>\n<li>No: 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3. Other Governance Participation</strong></p>\n<p>-The full point for this category is 1. This category is to recognize other ways one could contribute to discussion regarding Uniswap Governance. This can be achieved by either</p>\n<p><strong>1. Joined Uniswap Gov Workshop Before</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Yes: 1</li>\n<li>No: 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Or</p>\n<p><strong>2. Joined Uniswap Community Call Before</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Yes: 1</li>\n<li>No: 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Tie Breaker</strong></p>\n<p>-Ties will be decided by the date of the first on chain vote these applicants casted in order to reward those delegates that have been contributing to Uniswap governance for an extended period.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget</strong></p>\n<p>We are requesting 540,000 [6000 USD *6 Months *15 Delegates ] USD worth of UNI for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative.</p>\n<p>The total amount, once approved, will be sent to the Accountability Committee, which will be responsible for the monthly distribution of rewards to eligible delegates and the proposal authors. Since the total budget of the now disbanded Delegate Reward WG has not been fully used, administration of this reward program–including the creation of this proposal and the admin work behind verifying monthly delegate participation–will be paid for using the current balance of $41.6k. The monthly admin consumption will be communicated each month to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>On August 20th , the snapshot vote will go live as well as well as the Delegate Reward Delegate application process. The application process will end on 27th.</p>\n<p>On August 25th, assuming the snapshot vote passed, will proceed to Onchain vote.</p>\n            <p><small>11 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward-initiative-cycle-2/24404\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward-initiative-cycle-2/24404","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 16:29:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24404"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward-initiative-cycle-2/24404.rss","#text":"[RFC] Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 2"},"filter":false},{"title":"July '24 Uniswap Report","dc:creator":"Oku","category":"Uncategorized","description":"<p>Hello Uniswap Community,</p>\n<p>We published our most recent issue of the Uniswap Monthly Report, summarizing protocol metrics for July 2024.</p>\n<p>You can find our latest report at <a href=\"https://www.newsletter.oku.trade/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">newsletter.oku.trade </a> and subscribe for future monthly releases.</p>\n<p>Here’s the executive summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In July 2024, the Uniswap Protocol processed $59.02 billion in monthly volume (+7.7%) across $6.37 billion in liquidity (-2.1%), earning market makers $76.43 million in fees (-15.1%).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Across all chains, Ethereum saw the most Uniswap volume with $26.74 billion in v3 pools, seconded by Arbitrum.

The offchain vote (Snapshot) will be a weighted voting where each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices to help to assess three blockchain for Forse to analyze.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>In February 2024, the Uniswap DAO introduced the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program, which incentivizes users to participate in current and new deployments of Uniswap on different networks within the L2 space. The initial onboarding packages of this program cost the Uniswap DAO at least $3.5M worth of assets.</p>\n<p>We propose that Uniswap DAO engage with Forse, our DAO intelligence and analytics platform, to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth program and assess if the current approach drives real growth.</p>\n<p>By assessing the impacts of the Revitalization and Growth Program, the Uniswap DAO will have valuable insights to improve further iterations of the Revitalization and Growth Program or other incentive programs. Armed with this information, Uniswap DAO will be able to understand what was the most relevant user groups, and their acquisition cost, and evaluate if the Revitalization and Growth program effectively modified user behavior and led to increased stickiness of users, and therefore TVL and other top-level protocol metrics.</p>\n<p>Recently, StableLab supported the Arbitrum DAO as the Program Manager for the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program</a>, and we delivered a comprehensive <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stablelab-analyzing-stip-s-efficacy-and-ltipp-comparison/24777/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">analysis</a> of the STIP to the Arbitrium DAO.</p>\n<p>With Uniswap allocating over $3.5M worth of assets for the purpose of growing Uniswap’s market share, it is essential to ensure that the DAO analyses and reviews the impact of these incentives on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Forse?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forse.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Forse</a> is a data and intelligence platform built by StableLab helping DAOs analyze the impact of governance decisions in protocol growth, top-line metrics, and governance operations, including its cost and effort structures. <a href=\"https://www.stablelab.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">StableLab</a> is the leading provider of governance products and solutions for decentralized protocols.

Christian has several published scientific articles, including: <a href=\"https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1709396/document.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a Taxonomy of DAOs;</a> <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/16/7/330\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">scoring methodologies for DAOs;</a> <a href=\"https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1742459/document.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">network analysis of DAOS; </a><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07059\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">classification of DAO proposals using LLMs</a>; among others.</p>\n<p><strong>Johannes Loewe</strong> is the Data Lead at StableLab, where he focuses on all stages of AI and ML development, from experimentation to deployment. Before joining StableLab, he was a Freelance AI &amp; Blockchain Software Engineer. He also has experience with DAOs, being a founding member of PretzelDAO in Munich. He holds a Bachelor’s degree from Radboud University in the Netherlands and a Master’s degree in Machine Learning from NUI-Galway in Ireland.</p>\n<p><strong>Marcos Miranda</strong> is the Head of Product at StableLab. With over 5 years of experience in Product Management, with focus on Web3 and Analytics products, he is also experienced in building DeFi protocols, having previously worked for other protocols in the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Specification</strong></p>\n<p>By analyzing the impact of these incentives, Forse by StableLab hopes to identify the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impact quantification of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program in top-line protocol metrics with the isolation of external factors influencing these metrics as far as permitted and reasonably possible.</li>\n<li>User segmentation and analysis based on archetypes of users to determine the types of users attracted through the incentive program.</li>\n<li>Post-Incentive user retention, reactivation, and user acquisition cost metrics.</li>\n<li>Per-dollar value of incentives compared to other ways of incentivising users (e.g. Airdrops, LP rewards, grants, …).</li>\n<li>User Retention and activity patterns over the time of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To see Forse in action, explore our <a href=\"https://dashboard.forse.io/main/arbitrum/grants_program/Short_Term_Incentives_Program\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">interactive dashboard</a> showcasing the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program. This provides a great example of what our output could be for Uniswap’s Revitalization and Growth Program.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget Request</strong></p>\n<p>The proposal requests $70,000 worth of UNI to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program so far for 3 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO, with 3 months of additional maintenance support and updates to analytics modules utilized in the live dashboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Three Blockchains Chosen by the Uniswap DAO</strong></p>\n<p>We believe it will be better for Uniswap to better understand the impacts of the Incentive program for protocols that are at least sizable. So the options will compose the top 6 blockchains by TVL.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Blockchains</th>\n<th>TVL</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum</td>\n<td>$2.596b</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Base</td>\n<td>$1.35b</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blast</td>\n<td>$838.46m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scroll</td>\n<td>$601.14m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Linea</td>\n<td>$519.15m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mantle</td>\n<td>$440.09m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zksync</td>\n<td>$77.19m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sei</td>\n<td>$70.62m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manta</td>\n<td>$39.74m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moonbeam</td>\n<td>$31.45m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon zkEVM</td>\n<td>$13.2m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Taiko</td>\n<td>$13.29m</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Next Steps</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Launching Snapshot vote to decide the top 3 blockchains as well as regarding whether to proceed with this proposal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proceed to Onchain Vote if the snapshot vote passes</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>17 posts - 11 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-forse-analytics-for-uniswap-revitalization-and-growth-program/24373\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-forse-analytics-for-uniswap-revitalization-and-growth-program/24373","pubDate":"Wed, 07 Aug 2024 22:40:26 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24373"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-forse-analytics-for-uniswap-revitalization-and-growth-program/24373.rss","#text":"[Temp Check] Forse Analytics for Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program"},"filter":false},{"title":"Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) Review Report","dc:creator":"fin_areta","category":"Governance-Meta","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/da1f124d4cad47f2b8ccb07c01aa8a85c141b2e9.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/v7AEQTFVPnNa8330LZtb3Q34yPT.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 12.12.31 PM\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/da1f124d4cad47f2b8ccb07c01aa8a85c141b2e9_2_690x379.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 12.12.31 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"v7AEQTFVPnNa8330LZtb3Q34yPT\" width=\"690\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/da1f124d4cad47f2b8ccb07c01aa8a85c141b2e9_2_690x379.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/da1f124d4cad47f2b8ccb07c01aa8a85c141b2e9_2_1035x568.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/da1f124d4cad47f2b8ccb07c01aa8a85c141b2e9_2_1380x758.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D5B2BD\"></a></div><p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/speech_balloon.png?v=12\" title=\":speech_balloon:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":speech_balloon:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Hi all, the Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) is coming to an end. It has been an exciting experience growing alongside the program since its <a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/vote/2/47\">inception</a> in November 2023. Over the 9 months since, we have been thrilled by the interest, quality, and enthusiasm of the people and projects building at the intersection of these two ecosystems. Through our initial program design &amp; operations phase, and beyond with our <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/extension-of-the-uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp/23369/4\">program extension</a>, we have felt that operating a cross-ecosystem program of this nature has given us the opportunity to see and feel first-hand the impact that grants have in realizing ecosystem growth; as it has always been a key piece to move crypto forward.</p>\n<p>This final UAGP review report, provided below, will present the details of our experience, including investigating program outcomes, sharing learnings, and looking at what lies ahead. As always since Day-1 with the UAGP, we highly encourage you to share your feedback, thoughts, or questions on this piece and on the program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1><a name=\"p-53486-table-of-contents-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53486-table-of-contents-1\"></a><strong>Table of Contents</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>I.

Abstract</h1>\n<p>As the Uniswap Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) reaches the end of its scheduled operation, we felt it necessary and important to share a retrospective of the program with the DAO.</p>\n<p>Given the UAGP’s novelty as a cross-ecosystem grant program, many learnings and insights can be taken away from our experience, which in turn will hopefully inspire and inform other programs looking to fund ideas that strengthen within or beyond the Uniswap ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This program report will cover everything from our operations as the UAGP committee, to grant and program outcomes, key learnings, and future prospects. Our aim is to continue the functioning system and progress through a new Grant Program for the Uniswap Ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-53486-ii-executive-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53486-ii-executive-summary-3\"></a>II. Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>Since its inception in November 2023, the Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) has fostered significant interest and enthusiasm, successfully funding innovative projects at the intersection of these ecosystems.

Way Forward</h1>\n<p>As the UAGP closed to new applications at the end of July, we remain active for the next 6 months in a significantly reduced capacity (20%) for milestone-verification and reporting. Given the timelines laid out in our 12 grant outlines, we expect the remaining projects to have fully completed their grant milestones before the end of our UAGP reporting/funding coverage, for this, the remaining ~$81k USD worth of ARB in the treasury will be used to cover operational expenses.</p>\n<p>Further, and motivated by the feedback and outcomes of the first iteration of the UAGP, we are presently exploring a way forward to continue funding innovative projects that provide value to these core networks, and beyond in web3.</p>\n<p>Through the various awareness initiatives we ran over the course of the UAGP, the committee has noticed the quality and quantity of applications dip in recent weeks. Appreciating this, and in light of strong demand on the Uniswap core side for a grant program to support further ecosystem growth, we are currently in the works of iterating RFPs for Uniswap-focused grant program.</p>\n<p>In an effort to identify the most meaningful opportunities, we are looking to hold conversations with delegates, builders, and researchers within the ecosystem. Off the back of these conversations, we hope to be back with a program to further grow and strengthen the Uniswap ecosystem as it continues to lead the charge for DeFi, and all of web3.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-53486-vi-helpful-links-35\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53486-vi-helpful-links-35\"></a>VI.

The crown jewel of this trading is the ETH/USDC pool on Ethereum mainnet. The pool between ETH/USD trading pairs is the most important pool within a chain’s ecosystem because it represents the transition between flight-to-safety and risk-taking.</p>\n<p>Most other pools within the AMM ecosystem utilize ETH as their pair asset. Pools generally do this, because ETH is correlated with most assets trading on blockchain-based markets. However, ETH is by definition not correlated with USDC, thus making it the most difficult pair to provide liquidity for in AMM markets.</p>\n<p>On July 27th, Aerodrome ETH/USDC overtook both the Uniswap ETH/USDC both on Base and Ethereum - marking the first time for this newcomer DEX.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/f/fc2f296ededda8d21a4e90b626b56859bf1badfb.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zYVmIeCSMdptvnFUkiprxStO8rh.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/fc2f296ededda8d21a4e90b626b56859bf1badfb_2_227x303.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"zYVmIeCSMdptvnFUkiprxStO8rh\" width=\"227\" height=\"303\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/fc2f296ededda8d21a4e90b626b56859bf1badfb_2_227x303.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/fc2f296ededda8d21a4e90b626b56859bf1badfb_2_340x454.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/fc2f296ededda8d21a4e90b626b56859bf1badfb_2_454x606.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"222126\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1817225900737654863\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1817225900737654863</a></p>\n<p>One could say that Aerodrome has now entered the decentralized exchange thunderdome.

This is the <a href=\"https://basescan.org/address/0xd0b53d9277642d899df5c87a3966a349a798f224#readContract\">ETH/USDC 5 bps pool</a>, which is also shown in black. For reference, the large orange share (labeled 52.4%) above is all pools outside of the top 10 combined.</p>\n<p>Observant readers will notice the difference between these two pools right away - the Aerodrome ETH/USDC pool has a 4 bps fee while the Uniswap v3 pool has a 5 bps fee. Because most retail users have nearly 0 price impact on their trades, liquidity differences between the two pools will not bring back flow. This is because the fee from the trade dominates the cost of trading on that pool. Liquidity mining alone will not bring back the flow. For the rest of this piece, we will focus on the ETH/USDC pools on both of the protocols.</p>\n<p>Most retail users’ trades are semi-sophisticated because they use interfaces to find the best routes for their trades. Because of this, the difference in 1 bp will cause sophisticated interfaces to choose Aerodrome over Uniswap.</p>\n<p>To test this, we labeled the top 400 interface contracts by volume as either retail or non-retail (ie MEV). We checked where interfaces were routing their volume to and how much volume is from arbitrage volume (volume routed from MEV bots). These lists can be seen in the queries below.</p>\n<p>Our sample is over the last 14 days as of the time of writing. On Uniswap Protocol, $293m of retail flow went into Uniswap v3. On Aerodrome, $425m of retail flow went into their Protocol. This is about a 45% difference in retail flow. This is significant, but the difference is not without a cost.</p>\n<p>The higher fee tier of the pool <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14604\">protects LPs more from arbitrage losses</a>. For reference, the arbitrage volumes on Aerodrome are $2.18b while the Uniswap Protocol was $588m, almost a 4 times increase. While there is a retail volume difference, the volume generated from arbitrage is massively different as well.</p>\n<p>Notice that while Aerodrome has higher retail volumes, the arbitrage volumes are also significantly higher. More importantly, the volume of non-retail trades is proportionately much more than on Uniswap Protocol. This means much more of the flow that the LPs of Aerodrome are taking is worse. Because fee-tiers are inversely proportional to arbitrage losses, while the difference between 4 bps and 5 bps may seem small, the inverse relationship combined means the impact of these fee differences is super-linear.</p>\n<p><strong>ETH/USDC volume categorized by originator on Aerodrome</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/dda20882831e70efb8649b31fc041afc59f1df2f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vCEFSXxlBAag0ZgxYbMSC26Kz1R.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/dda20882831e70efb8649b31fc041afc59f1df2f_2_624x357.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"vCEFSXxlBAag0ZgxYbMSC26Kz1R\" width=\"624\" height=\"357\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/dda20882831e70efb8649b31fc041afc59f1df2f_2_624x357.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/dda20882831e70efb8649b31fc041afc59f1df2f_2_936x535.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/dda20882831e70efb8649b31fc041afc59f1df2f_2_1248x714.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8D7CF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3946817/6639387\">https://dune.com/queries/3946817/6639387</a></p>\n<p>Note: The data is Jul 13th - Jul 27th and the selected ETH/USDC pool</p>\n<p>ETH/USDC volume categorized by originator on Uniswap v3</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/5/56c9f9d2ca7a44840c662f2bc0f72c80c3a23100.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/cnLNdfDcVaKZIZrAraZnKBuhG6I.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56c9f9d2ca7a44840c662f2bc0f72c80c3a23100_2_624x356.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"cnLNdfDcVaKZIZrAraZnKBuhG6I\" width=\"624\" height=\"356\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56c9f9d2ca7a44840c662f2bc0f72c80c3a23100_2_624x356.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56c9f9d2ca7a44840c662f2bc0f72c80c3a23100_2_936x534.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56c9f9d2ca7a44840c662f2bc0f72c80c3a23100_2_1248x712.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F1DBD4\"></a></div><br>\nSource: <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3946818/6639388\">https://dune.com/queries/3946818/6639388</a><br>\nNote: The data is Jul 13th - Jul 27th and the selected ETH/USDC pool<p></p>\n<p>Not all flow is equal, and more volumes may not necessarily be better for LPs. However, there is also <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09494\">evidence</a> that Layer 2 Protocols significantly lower losses and increase LP capital efficiency - this is due to lower blocktimes and lower fees. Because of this, the market clearing fee for LPs on L2s may actually be lower than 5 bps. Because Uniswap v3 has fee-tiers chosen by governance + the initial deployers, it is likely that these fee tiers may not totally be accurate.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>In the analysis above, we suppose that the reason why Uniswap has lost market share to Aerodrome over the last 4 months is Aerodrome’s lower fee tier on its ETH-USDC pool. This pool has attracted more retail flow as Uniswap’s flows have remained similar. The increase in retail flow and lower fees have in turn attracted significant non-retail flow.</p>\n<p>Since Aerodrome is a Uniswap v3 fork, we see this analysis as good evidence of the viability of a lower fee pool for ETH-USDC on Base and suggest it as evidence to governance that this proposal has merit.</p>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<p>One benefit of Uniswap v3 is the incentive to collect liquidity into one pool, creating network effects.

This will overcome the effects from liquidity fragmentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>Just like the <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488\">1 bp fee tier</a> originally proposed 3 years ago by Getty Hill, we propose to additionally add a 2, 3, 4 bps fee tier to Uniswap v3 on Base.</p>\n<p>You may question why we are proposing the creation of three new fee tiers when our analysis only focused on 4 bps. There are two reasons for this. For one, Aerodrome is able to adjust fees automatically on Base. We anticipate they may respond by lowering fees below 4 bps and want Uniswap Protocol to allow LPs to move without governance intervention if this happens.</p>\n<p>Second, we believe this analysis may be a single case study into a larger finding that the required fee for LPs on L2s may be lower than 5 bps. While Aerodrome highlights the success of a 4 bp fee tier, it’s unclear whether that’s the right market rate. It may be lower.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we note that this change should not be blindly repeated on other chains. The community should do further research on the success or failures of this program before executing it on another chain.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/e/e00e07a5a59b4f372d12b5f476c7ed9c4287b09a.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"vY50L3r1h8SXxYIdtoMBLTJ9ki6\" width=\"308\" height=\"168\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n            <p><small>17 posts - 11 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-proposal-to-active-2-3-4-bps-fee-tiers-on-base/24346\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-proposal-to-active-2-3-4-bps-fee-tiers-on-base/24346","pubDate":"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 16:01:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24346"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-proposal-to-active-2-3-4-bps-fee-tiers-on-base/24346.rss","#text":"[RFC] Proposal to active 2, 3, 4 bps fee-tiers on Base"},"filter":false},{"title":"Whetstone Research Delegate Platform","dc:creator":"aadams","category":"Delegation Pitch","description":"<p>Key Information</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Whetstone Research</li>\n<li>Delegate ENS: whetstoneresearch.eth</li>\n<li>Delegate Address: 0xd18bff14A9541f146071B0b8292c2274e2AE3b8e</li>\n<li>Forum Username: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/aadams\">@aadams</a></li>\n<li>Twitter: whetstonedotcc</li>\n<li>Website: <a href=\"https://whetstone.cc/\">https://whetstone.cc/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>About Us<br>\nWe are a research team focusing on the future of onchain markets.

The Attackathon will consist of three phases: education, active code hunting, and result evaluation. The goal is to enhance the security of the Ethereum network, which in turn benefits the entire DeFi ecosystem, including Uniswap.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-2-motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-2-motivation-4\"></a>2 - Motivation</h1>\n<p>The Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi are introducing the first-ever “Attackathon” program, which is aimed to be the largest ever crowdsourced security audit contest conducted to augment security for the entirety of the protocol’s code.</p>\n<p>An Attackathon is a multifaceted event involving three phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before the Attackathon: A comprehensive education program on the protocol’s code delivered via live technical walkthroughs and Attackathon Academy content.</li>\n<li>During the Attackathon: Security researchers hunt for vulnerabilities in the code based on specific rules to qualify for rewards. Only impactful reports, as specified by the rules of the Attackathon, will be rewarded.</li>\n<li>After the Attackathon: Immunefi evaluates and compiles the results into an official Attackathon report, spotlighting top researchers with monetary rewards, NFT awards and a leaderboard.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although the Ethereum Foundation has a permanent bug bounty, it does not get the awareness and eyeballs it should get on the code. While the EF Bug Bounty has existed since 2015, it typically only receives 2-3 low-medium reports per week. Therefore, we hope that through this event we can draw more skilled security professionals to audit Ethereum and blockchain projects more broadly.</p>\n<p>Following recent large hard forks such as Dencun and Shapella, the Ethereum network has undergone significant changes, making this the ideal time to conduct an extensive security audit. Ensuring the protocol’s stability and security post-upgrade is crucial for maintaining trust and reliability.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-proposal-details-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-3-proposal-details-5\"></a>3 - Proposal Details</h1>\n<p>This Attackathon will be held fully online. Immunefi will host the contest on their platform and triage the bug reports, and the EF Protocol Security Research Team will judge the results together with representatives from client teams.</p>\n<p>The scope of this Attackathon program seeks to include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specification Bugs:\n<ul>\n<li>Safety/finality-breaking bugs</li>\n<li>Denial of service (DOS) vectors</li>\n<li>Inconsistencies in assumptions, like situations where honest validators can be slashed</li>\n<li>Calculation or parameter inconsistencies</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Client Bugs:\n<ul>\n<li>Spec non-compliance issues</li>\n<li>Unexpected crashes, RCE or denial of service (DOS) vulnerabilities</li>\n<li>Any issues causing irreparable consensus splits from the rest of the network</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Solidity Compiler Bugs</li>\n<li>Deposit Contract Bugs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The primary ask for the Uniswap community in supporting this project will be in funding, but any contributions to broadcast the program through socials would also be appreciated!</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-4-benefits-to-the-uniswap-community-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-4-benefits-to-the-uniswap-community-6\"></a>4 - Benefits to the Uniswap Community</h1>\n<p>Conducting the Attackathon now, following recent major hard forks of the Ethereum network, is crucial. These upgrades have brought significant changes, and a comprehensive security audit will ensure the protocol’s stability and security post-upgrade. This increased focus on security will attract significant attention to the Ethereum codebase, enhancing visibility and participation from security researchers.</p>\n<p>For the Uniswap community, this initiative has direct benefits. Enhancing Ethereum’s security directly improves Uniswap’s reliability and trustworthiness, as Uniswap’s security is inherently tied to Ethereum’s security. A secure Ethereum fosters a confident developer community, which benefits the entire DeFi ecosystem, including Uniswap. Moreover, by including the Solidity compiler in the competition’s scope, the Attackathon will specifically address potential vulnerabilities in the primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, which includes those used by Uniswap. Ensuring the security of the Solidity compiler will thus directly enhance the security of Uniswap’s smart contracts.</p>\n<p>Additionally, aligning with Ethereum’s security efforts offers cost-effective benefits. Uniswap will gain from top-tier security assessments without bearing the entire cost, ensuring a secure and robust environment for its operations. Furthermore, by upskilling security researchers now, we prepare them for future hard fork contests, enhancing the overall security readiness of the Ethereum and Uniswap ecosystems.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-5-cost-and-timeline-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-5-cost-and-timeline-7\"></a>5 - Cost and Timeline</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"h-51-sponsorship-tiers-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-51-sponsorship-tiers-8\"></a>5.1 - Sponsorship Tiers</h2>\n<p>Unicorn Partners (+75 ETH Commitment, Approx. $250,000) (limited to two sponsors)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank</li>\n<li>Participation in Attackathon Kick-off Twitter Space as a partner speaker</li>\n<li>Leaderboard Placement on Sponsor page</li>\n<li>Top-tier logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page</li>\n<li>Top-tier logo placement on the Program Education page and program report</li>\n<li>Call out in Press Releases and EF and Immunefi Program Announcement Blogs</li>\n<li>Digital Logo Placement in the results announcement at Devcon or a dedicated virtual event</li>\n<li>4x Devcon tickets</li>\n<li>25% Discount on Crowd Sec offerings [transferable]</li>\n<li>1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Panda Partners (+30 ETH Commitment, Approx. $100,000)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank</li>\n<li>Leaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page</li>\n<li>Mid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page</li>\n<li>2x Devcon tickets</li>\n<li>10% Discount on Immunefi Crowd Sec offerings [Transferable]</li>\n<li>1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"h-52-timeline-and-key-dates-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-52-timeline-and-key-dates-9\"></a>5.2 - Timeline and Key Dates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>July 8-11: EthCC program announcement</li>\n<li>August 8: Detailed program announcement and education kickoff.</li>\n<li>September 1st: Attackathon hunting begins.</li>\n<li>October 31st: Attackathon concludes, and results compilation begins.</li>\n<li>November 9-17: Results announced.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-ethereum-foundation-attackathon-sponsorship/24343\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-ethereum-foundation-attackathon-sponsorship/24343","pubDate":"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 13:53:54 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24343"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-ethereum-foundation-attackathon-sponsorship/24343.rss","#text":"[RFC] - Ethereum Foundation Attackathon Sponsorship"},"filter":false},{"title":"[RFC] Forse for Uniswap Analytics for Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program","dc:creator":"Doo_StableLab","category":"Proposal Discussion","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/63ebb1abd7be4fc6c828a78f6d9bfd3a8aefe736.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/efWeZ6bR0AL5Ck6ZXVyKC1AgxLM.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/63ebb1abd7be4fc6c828a78f6d9bfd3a8aefe736_2_624x167.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"efWeZ6bR0AL5Ck6ZXVyKC1AgxLM\" width=\"624\" height=\"167\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/63ebb1abd7be4fc6c828a78f6d9bfd3a8aefe736_2_624x167.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/63ebb1abd7be4fc6c828a78f6d9bfd3a8aefe736_2_936x250.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/63ebb1abd7be4fc6c828a78f6d9bfd3a8aefe736_2_1248x334.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"0B1820\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Simple Summary</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to onboard Forse by StableLab as a data service provider, helping analyze the effectiveness of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>The Uniswap DAO recently introduced the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program which incentivizes users in current and new deployments of Uniswap in different networks within the L2 space.

The Accountability Committee will be responsible for updating this thread.</p>\n<p><strong>What does it mean for a deployment to be “official”?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uniswap v3 was initially released under a BUSL license to prevent others from forking the protocol and using it for commercial purposes. As of April 2023, the BUSL was converted to an open-source license, allowing for the commercial usage of the v3 contracts. Such a transition can lead anyone to deploy the relevant v3 contracts on any EVM, claiming those contracts to be “the official Uniswap”.</li>\n<li>In order to prevent entities apart from the Uniswap DAO, who may or may not have ill intentions or an ulterior motive behind deploying the given v3 contracts, the Uniswap Foundation implemented <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/38\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a process</a> to officiate deployments across numerous EVMs.</li>\n<li>This grants authority solely to the Uniswap DAO to declare which v3 deployments are official, thereby preserving Uniswap’s reputable brand.

As the barrier of fees would be removed for users, they’d be more motivated to buy and hold Glo Dollars and fund public goods at no cost.</li>\n<li>Support the development of an alternative <a href=\"https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/EntityDetails.aspx/COMPANY/2376957\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">US regulated</a> stablecoin that benefits the public and the broader crypto ecosystem.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most swaps to Glo Dollar are made on Uniswap, and it could result in many more swaps if fees were waived to grow our market cap and fund more public goods. At scale, each additional million in Glo Dollar market cap would generate up to $50,000 in public goods funding per year—at no cost to the user.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-is-glo-dollar-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#what-is-glo-dollar-2\"></a>What is Glo Dollar?</h2>\n<p>Stablecoin companies generate $7.4 billion annually from their reserves.</p>\n<p>Our approach is different—we funnel 100% of profits to charitable causes. By adopting Glo Dollar, you fund your favorite public goods without paying for it. We call it Automatic Public Goods Funding (AutoPGF).</p>\n<p>Our users choose which causes to support: web3 public goods, fighting extreme poverty, or combating climate change.</p>\n<p>Individuals and companies embed zero-cost philanthropy with Glo in many ways. Gitcoin and Polygon Labs added Glo Dollars to their treasuries. Others pay salaries in Glo Dollars, or use Glo Dollar backed credit cards.</p>\n<p>When you hold Glo Dollars, you can choose the causes you’d like to support <a href=\"https://app.glodollar.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">from our dApp</a>. All our donations are made onchain and <a href=\"https://www.glodollar.org/articles/donations\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">reported on our website</a>.</p>\n<p>Glo Dollar is 100% fiat-backed, always redeemable 1:1 for USD and USDC, and is issued and regulated in the US. Glo Dollar is available across 7 blockchains: Ethereum, Celo, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Stellar, and Base.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Uniswap users can swap between USDC and USDT without paying fees.</p>\n<p>Swaps from USDT or USDC into Glo Dollar (USDGLO) incur a fee of 0.25%. For example, if a user exchanges $1,000 worth of USDC for USDGLO, they would pay a fee of about $25.</p>\n<p>Because holding Glo Dollars = funding public cost (at no cost), we believe that users should be motivated to swap Glo Dollars without paying fees.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"risks-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#risks-4\"></a>Risks</h2>\n<p>Glo Dollar is 100% fiat-backed, always redeemable 1:1 for USD and USDC, issued and regulated in the United States, and receives <a href=\"https://brale.xyz/stablecoins/USDGLO\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">monthly independent attestations</a>.</p>\n<p>In April, we received our <a href=\"https://bluechip.org/coins/usdglo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bluechip rating</a>, with an initial B grade. This places us in the top 10 fiat-backed stablecoin, and we’re deemed safer than Tether’s USDT, FRAX, FDUSD, among others. Glo Dollar received the following assessments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stability: Stable</li>\n<li>Management: Very low risk</li>\n<li>Governance: Low risk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Glo Dollar is developed by the Glo Foundation and is issued by <a href=\"https://brale.xyz/stablecoins/USDGLO\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Brale.

Over the past six years, Michigan Blockchain has partnered with over 20 organizations and has governed a combined $30M in delegations. All new members go through a semester-long cohort that teaches them about the fundamentals of blockchain and provides them exposure to a diversity of blockchain applications. Our educational program prepares members for organizational involvement through three main avenues: governance, consulting, and investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Governance Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Our team has actively participated in governance voting and spearheaded proposal development for 5 primary protocols: Uniswap, Arbitrum, Compound, Origin Protocol, and Stader Labs. Each protocol is assigned a designated expert, responsible for continuous monitoring of the protocol’s developments on forums, social media, and voting platforms (Snapshot and Tally).</p>\n<p>At committee meetings, protocol leads share updates with the entire governance team on active proposals and debate the pros/cons to reach a collective decision on how to vote with our delegated tokens. We have a high participation rate, having reviewed and kept up our voting record for each delegated protocol.

The proposal bundles four proposals that have previously been approved in individual temperature checks. While we typically like to avoid bundling proposals, we consulted with the Accountability Committee (AC) and other members of the DAO prior to posting the proposal to weigh the operational headache of getting four delegates to make proposals. In the future, the organization could consider upgrading our governance contract to make it easier to run multiple governance proposals.

The proposal is co-authored by Arana.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> Vote <strong>For</strong>. We support the DAO’s exploration of new ways to manage its treasury and are particularly interested in how it might handle protocol-owned liquidity. After deploying UNI incentives to several new EVM chains, it would be great if the DAO could begin allocating ETH-stablecoin and stable-stable LP to chains.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xf17f3ca6b3d1aa6d8061a733fc0d627558159e0057f76ddfe056ea492cf56163\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Temp Check - DeFi Education Fund</a><br>\n<strong>Summary</strong>: GFX Labs sponsored DEF’s proposal, which requested 1M UNI. 500K was transferred to the DEF’s Coinbase account, and the other 500K will be streamed to the DEF over 12 months. DEF’s founding grant came in July 2021. They have two years of operations currently, but for them to fight larger and longer battles, they need additional funding.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Vote <strong>For</strong>. The DEF has proven to be a great investment for the DAO and the ecosystem.

Since GFX Labs favored the original proposal, we decided to abstain from voting in the poll.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-53141-may-proposals-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53141-may-proposals-2\"></a>May Proposals</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xfe8cb4e08138df2f0d136480e85edadf22679cca73b68f3f376d12f322dd2565\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Temp Check - Uniswap Delegate Reward 3 Months Cycle 1</a><br>\n<strong>Summary</strong>: StableLab introduced the DAO’s first Delegate compensation program. The program will run for three months. Qualifying delegates will receive compensation based on some basic metrics.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Vote <strong>For</strong>. GFX Labs is in favor of being a delegate compensation program. Delegate compensation is a key issue in attracting and retaining high-quality delegates. While this program is imperfect in many ways, we will not let perfection prevent progress. Instead, we invite (and have done so proactively) other organizations and delegates to propose improved programs. Ideally, the DAO can select a new and improved program each cycle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0x35ed89cbda5bd11e333202c62d89fa223eab651adeb5e2cf6640d22411cc0946\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Temp Check - Onboard Uniswap to Redstone</a><br>\n<strong>Summary</strong>: Redstone is requesting to become an official Uniswap deployment and an Onboarding Package. Due to Redstone’s limited TVL and market position, it does not merit an Onboarding Package at this time. We would be happy to reevaluate down the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:  Deploy without incentives.

In their application to Arbitrum DAO, the UADP stated that they would request a matching of funds from Uniswap. Gauntlet will manage the rewarded funds via Merkl’s platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Vote (1st) $250k, (2nd) Do Not Fund, (3rd) $500k, (4th) $750k, (5th) $1m. Uniswap has a strong position in Arbitrum. A modest matching of funds with the LTIPP seems appropriate, but we discourage significant investment in Arbitrum over other opportunities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/65\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap Arbitrum LTIPP Matching </a><br>\n<strong>Summary</strong>: The UADP secured 1M ARB from Arbitrum’s LTIPP program. In their application to Arbitrum DAO, the UADP stated that they would request a matching of funds from Uniswap. Gauntlet will manage the rewarded funds via Merkl’s platform. The prior temperature check resulted in $750K, which is requested in this onchain proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Vote <strong>For</strong>. While the amount is more than we had ideally considered, it is within reason. However, we will be unlikely to vote in favor of further UNI allocated to Arbitrum unless there is clear evidence of Uniswap losing meaningful market share and a clear plan for the UNI to combat that issue.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/24194\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/24194","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 01:52:32 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24194"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/24194.rss","#text":"GFX Labs - Delegate Communication Thread"},"filter":true},{"title":"[RFC] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Mantle Network","dc:creator":"MantleCoreTeam","category":"Proposal Discussion","description":"<h2><a name=\"proposal-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#proposal-summary-1\"></a>Proposal Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The purpose of this post is to simply communicate alignment from the Mantle Core Contributor Team, describe the current state of Mantle, and allow for there to be a space on the forums tracking this deployment.</li>\n<li>All of the Uni v3 contracts have already been deployed (see below), and this deployment has been <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xd457a6cdb9e20002d74c30818b7b35a694af04c627cc7bf6d855d4ece9409333\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">elected by the DAO to receive $250k UNI worth of incentives</a>.</li>\n<li>No further actions need to be taken by the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"about-mantle-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#about-mantle-2\"></a>About Mantle</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"network-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#network-overview-3\"></a>Network Overview</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://mantle.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Network</a> is an optimistic Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution with an EVM-compatible execution environment. Mantle is DAO-governed and employs a modular approach to execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability. Mantle Network Mainnet Alpha v1 was launched on July 17, 2023. Mantle Network Mainnet v2 Tectonic was launched on March 15, 2024.</p>\n<p>Mantle Network distinguishes itself through a <a href=\"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/overview#modular-architecture\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">modular chain design</a> by separating transaction, execution, consensus, settlement, and storage into different modules. In Mantle Network’s architecture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The execution layer is EVM-compatible and responsible for transaction execution. A sequencer produces L2 blocks and sends state root data to layer 1 (L1).</li>\n<li>Consensus and settlement are conducted on Ethereum’s L1.</li>\n<li>Data availability is ensured through Mantle DA, leveraging EigenDA technology to store callback data, which in conventional rollups would be published directly to L1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This modular approach allows for greater flexibility and optimization across different functionalities of the network.</p>\n<p>Mantle Ecosystem comprises of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/concepts/optimistic-rollups#what-are-optimistic-rollups\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Network</a> - A modular Ethereum L2.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Governance</a> - A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.mantle.xyz/governance/parameters/treasury#treasury-holdings-core\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle Treasury</a> - One of the largest on-chain treasuries in the industry.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mantle.xyz/meth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle LSP</a> - A permissionless, non-custodial ETH liquid staking protocol deployed on Ethereum L1 and governed by Mantle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mantle Network is governed by Mantle token (MNT), which serves as the central element in Mantle Ecosystem, fulfilling multiple roles including being the native gas token for transaction fees and fueling ecosystem growth. It’s also the governance token that empowers the community to make decisions about the ecosystem’s future directions.</p>\n<p>In an effort to spur innovation and development, Mantle also has financial initiatives like Mantle Grants Program and Mantle EcoFund, the latter boasting a sizable $200 million catalyzed capital pool, more on this below.

In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.</p>\n<p>Since Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This proposal requests a retroactive Onboarding Package for Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>While already deployed on Gnosis Chain, Uniswap is not currently capitalizing on it. This proposal aims to change that.</p>\n<p>One of the key areas of focus suggested by the Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee to expand the Uniswap ecosystem is “Uniswap Revitalization and Growth”. In their recent work, a large emphasis is on revisiting some of the old deployments and proactively capturing first-mover advantage on promising new chains.</p>\n<p>As Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth across Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we believe the chain aligns perfectly with the scope of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth initiative. Uniswap’s deployment on Gnosis Chain was completed in early 2022, hence Gnosis Chain was never a beneficiary of the “Onboarding Package” that is now included as a standard element of deployment proposals.</p>\n<p>We believe there are synergies between Uniswap and Gnosis Chain as well as a strong potential for Gnosis Chain to generate high volumes and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of its focus on payments and financial tools.</p>\n<p>As a comparison, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).</p>\n<p>We believe that additional visibility and an incentive program would enable both Uniswap and Gnosis Chain to tap into their synergies resulting in positive growth on both ends.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"about-gnosis-chain-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#about-gnosis-chain-3\"></a>About Gnosis Chain</h3>\n<p>Gnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. It features fast transaction times (5 seconds) and low transaction fees (500 tx for $0.01) with the unique advantage of having a stable token as a base asset for transactions and gas fees.</p>\n<p>One of the first Ethereum sidechains, Gnosis Chain’s core values are resilience and credible neutrality. By allowing contributors to easily run a node, Gnosis Chain created a community-owned, anti-fragile network secured by a geographically diverse validator set. Its strong culture of at-home stakers (not reliant on cloud providers or data centres) and its community governance ensure Gnosis Chain remains credibly neutral at a lower price point than Mainnet.</p>\n<p>Gnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralised financial tools accessible and usable for all. The collective features established blue chip projects like Safe as well as prominent ones like Gnosis Pay and Monerium.</p>\n<p>In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"benefits-to-uniswap-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#benefits-to-uniswap-4\"></a>Benefits to Uniswap</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Multichain Uniswap</a> approach has proven successful with approx. <a href=\"https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/uniswap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">35% of trading volumes</a> in the last 6 months come from non-Ethereum-Mainnet deployments.</p>\n<p>Since Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new and existing users leveraging Gnosis Chain as a payments infrastructure is a promising opportunity for the project to reach a new audience.</p>\n<p>Gnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects, building synergic services to Uniswap. Among those, Safe and Gnosis Pay. Safe Smart Accounts count 9.1 Million accounts deployed with $100B+ in total assets stored and VIP individuals (e.g. Vitalik) using them. Gnosis Pay is the world’s first on-chain spending account with a Visa Debit Card linked to a self-custodial blockchain wallet, connected with 80 Million merchants worldwide. Roll-out in Europe and the United Kingdom has already started, with upcoming new Countries including Brazil and Argentina. That is a combined population of approx. 1.45 Billion people.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Gnosis Chain powers a growing DeFi sector with numerous blue chip projects added since Q4 2023. These include Aave, whose market on Gnosis Chain has grown rapidly since its launch 7 months ago and is now larger than the lending protocol’s markets on Base and Scroll (as of May 2024). sDAI (MakerDAO’s interest-earning DAI) accumulated over $68 Million TVL since October 2023. Focusing on the on-chain trading vertical, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). This means, Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).</p>\n<p>Based on the above and observing Uniswap’s performance across blockchains, we anticipate the protocol will replicate its success in capturing market share on Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"bridges-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#bridges-5\"></a>Bridges</h3>\n<p>Gnosis Chain is committed to providing easy and secure access to Ethereum L1 and other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. For this reason, multiple bridging options are available to connect with Gnosis Chain.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/omnibridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Omnibridge</a> is a native token bridge that connects Ethereum and Gnosis Chain (and vice-versa) by minting the canonical representation of bridged assets on Gnosis. The Omnibridge is built on top of the <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/amb-bridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB)</a>, a key bridge primitive that is used inside higher-order bridges like the Omnibridge and allows Gnosis contracts to send data and trigger contract functions on Ethereum and vice-versa. Therefore, the Omnibridge relies on the same trust models and group of <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/management/validators#amb--omnibridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Trusted Bridge Validators</a> as the AMB. Part of these validators is Succinct Lab’s zkSNARK-enabled Light Client, Telepathy. Telepathy is a key component of the AMB bridge ecosystem as it enhances security and reliability for cross-chain transactions by providing validity proofs via zkSNARKs that ensure trustless verification of transaction events across chains.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/xdai-bridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">xDAI bridge</a> is a native DAI bridge from Ethereum that is used to mint and burn xDAI, the native asset used for gas and transaction fees on Gnosis.</p>\n<p>Gnosis has a long-term roadmap to move towards trustless bridges and is investing resources into trust-minimization of its bridges, to ensure trust and safety of users. <a href=\"https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hashi</a> is an EVM Hash Oracle Aggregator designed to enhance cross-chain bridge security by aggregating block headers from various sources. It supports 15+ General Message Passing bridges and ZK light clients, promoting redundancy and reducing reliance on single mechanisms. By requiring validation from multiple independent mechanisms, Hashi ensures greater resilience against security incidents. Gnosis plans to <a href=\"https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-93-should-gnosisdao-support-the-integration-of-hashi-within-gnosis-chains-canonical-bridges/8245\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gradually migrate</a> its canonical bridges to Hashi’s distributed trust model with the goal of strengthening security, decentralisation and interoperability.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Gnosis Chain is supported within independent bridge solutions that enable the cross-chain connection with other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. These include Jumper (provided by <a href=\"http://Li.Fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Li.Fi</a>), Bungee, Hop, Connext, DLN (debridge), LayerZero, Chainlink CCIP and Wormhole.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cost-and-timeline-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#cost-and-timeline-6\"></a>Cost and Timeline</h3>\n<p>This proposal requests a retroactive Onboarding Package for Gnosis Chain as well as costs for Merkl and Oku integrations.

We are mindful that these are opinions from accepted grantees and naturally are inclined toward more positive experiences with the UAGP. However, we still believe its worthwhile to run this exercise to test ourselves for any apparent gaps. This assumption was stress-tested by the fact no individual response rated the likelihood to recommend the UAGP to peers lower than a 9.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><a name=\"uagp-learnings-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#uagp-learnings-2\"></a>UAGP Learnings</h3>\n<p>Over the past five months, operating the UAGP has taught us several valuable lessons about managing a cross-ecosystem grant program, and we wanted to take a moment to highlight some of the more relevant learnings we’ve collected from our recent operations lately. A summary first, then addressing each learning in more detail below:</p>\n<p><strong>Key Learnings:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reporting Alignment: We adjusted our reporting processes from monthly to bimonthly to better align with the long-term focus of UAGP grants, reducing burnout and creating a more streamlined reporting flow.</li>\n<li>Cross Ecosystem Collaboration: We initiated a Grant Program alignment group to streamline cross-ecosystem collaboration and communication, addressing eligibility and overlap issues between Uniswap and Arbitrum grant programs.</li>\n<li>Prospective Applicant Perspectives: Discussions with rejected applicants highlighted the need for specific evaluation feedback, a clearer assessment rubric, and more streamlined application forms; all concerns we feel confident we have addressed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One major insight was the opportunity to adapt our reporting processes to better align with the nature of our grants (and grantees!). Given the long-term focus of UAGP grants, and the associated longer feedback loops between project initiation and milestone achievement, we pushed reporting and tracking tasks from monthly to bimonthly. In practice, this reporting change allows grantees to focus on their work and report only the most salient details in a period, reducing the risk of burnout for both grantees and community members involved in monthly reporting. This adjustment has been the latest adjustment in what we believe to now be a very streamlined reporting flow for grantees and the DAOs.</p>\n<p>Another insight came about when awareness for the UAGP picked began to pick up: we faced increasing overlaps with applications relevant to other parts of the Uniswap or Arbitrum ecosystem. This resulted in a manual process of having multiple bilateral Telegram chats with the other relevant Grant Programs / Foundations on the Uniswap and Arbitrum side sending applicants to different parts of the ecosystem and checking potential eligibility. While in the Uniswap ecosystem the ways are short and we have one specific counterparty for Grants (Aaron), on the Arbitrum side there are several relevant Grant programs. This led us to initiate an overarching Grant Program alignment group and helped steer initiatives to streamline this process through joint communication channels, incl. tackling topics such as potential double-dipping.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have also had several open topics and learnings emerge from the vibrant UAGP community discussions which play out across many forums and include all stakeholders, from delegates to rejected &amp; prospective UAGP applicants.  In particular, in community discussions with rejected UAGP applicants who raised concerns about perceived incongruities in the program, we were given deeper insight into the applicant perspective and journey through the UAGP. While at times it is important to take these opinions with a grain of salt, we hear all opinions with the utmost respect and consideration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Provide specific feedback to every applicant:</strong> While we would love to provide personalized feedback to every applicant, it is difficult due to the sheer volume of applications. Currently, we offer detailed feedback to applicants who specifically request it. If the DAO decides that every applicant should receive detailed denial feedback, we are happy to factor this into capacity planning for a potential extension of the program.</li>\n<li><strong>Make evaluation of all grantees public:</strong> While we have public evaluation rubrics to promote transparency on how our committee is assessing projects, in line with other leading grant programs within web3 including Arbitrum Foundation Grants and Plurality Labs, we do not make specific evaluation of grantees public. We decided to follow this market standard due to mitigate potential negative follow-on effects on denied applicants that could results out of a bad rating.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce number of application questions:</strong> In response to feedback about the program’s application questions being difficult to align with projects, we have simplified them in our recent extension round update to make it streamline this process for applicants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We deeply appreciate the community’s ongoing support and feedback, which help us strengthen the UAGP. We welcome all community feedback as we strive to build the best possible program.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We hope this mid-term survey and learnings help shine transparency on the current operation of the program. Our DMs are always open for thoughts or comments on what other data points to include going forward. We’re thrilled with the progress so far and are excited to continue extended operations for a few more months. Please stay tuned for next month’s full reporting as more downstream milestones (and launches!) are beginning to be achieved.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"contact-points-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#contact-points-3\"></a>Contact Points</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/white_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":white_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> To find all info: <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/1c1e8b33bc60436993dd65e37d022f9d?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">UAGP Information Hub</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/white_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":white_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> To reach out: <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/597638925346930701/1165739066365579314\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Discord</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/white_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":white_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> To stay up to date: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniArbGrants\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a></p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-midway-learnings-survey/24110\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-midway-learnings-survey/24110","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 08:16:00 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24110"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-midway-learnings-survey/24110.rss","#text":"Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) - Midway Learnings & Survey"},"filter":false},{"title":"Diversity for Working Groups","dc:creator":"drllau_LexDAO","category":"Governance-Meta","description":"<p>My observation is that working groups tend to be the <a href=\"https://communityrule.info/templates/self-appointed-board.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">self-appointed board</a> followed by co-opting (election/ratification) of “inner” circle.

Here are the next steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Delegate Reward for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WXf8Z2AnLIyKGNKYjKKsfb-c-d1hmCLAX-5rYAbiHDk/edit#gid=1513921069\">12 Delegates</a> will be available starting June 2024. The basic requirement is of following:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>-Maintain 80% onchain and offchain voting participation for the past 3 months. Achieving this will provide $3,000 USD worth of $UNI</p>\n<p>The snapshot date for the past 3 months for June will be taken at July 1st 9pm CET. Only proposals that have been completed would be counted (so if there’s a voting that for example go for June 30 to July 4th, as the voting is still ongoing as of July 1st, it won’t count as part of voting participation)</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>There’s also additional reward (only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled):</li>\n</ol>\n<p>-Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile. Achieving this will provide an additional $3,000 USD worth of $UNI</p>\n<p>While there are some discussions around when writing the rationale would be the most effective (for example, some would argue while the voting is still happening while some say within a week or two after the voting), for this month, we believe having it available till July 3rd 9pm CET for votings that have finished in June seems reasonable so that even if it ended on the last day of June, a delegate has time to write up the rationale. For easier tracking as well as for transparency with the community, please create a delegate profile and share the updates and rationales there as is a standard across different DAOs. Of course, sharing via other ways such as snapshot or tally is possible but it won’t count as fulfilling this requirement for this month.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Accountability Committee will help to keep track of these and share the status and qualification by July 8th. The delegates and the community will have till July 12 to challenge the result (for example, a delegate voted on a certain proposal but Accountability Committee mistakenly marked it down as not voted and thus challenged). If all is good or corrected, the first payments can be sent by the Accountability Committee on the week of July 15th. We are sure as the process becomes more streamlined, the payments can be sent earlier as time goes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Regarding Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group will be given the template to fill the hours for the retro payment (the max hours will be 40 hours). Please fill them by June 7th 9pm CET. Some members might take longer but please fill them by June 10th 9pm CET by the latest. Then the Accountability Committee will proceed with sending the payments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The current Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group will be dissolved. We welcome formations of new groups / ideas for the upcoming Cycle 2</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/next-steps-for-uniswap-delegate-reward/24070\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/next-steps-for-uniswap-delegate-reward/24070","pubDate":"Tue, 04 Jun 2024 09:22:45 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24070"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/next-steps-for-uniswap-delegate-reward/24070.rss","#text":"Next Steps for Uniswap Delegate Reward"},"filter":false}]}}}
