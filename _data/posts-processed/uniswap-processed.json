After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to a formation of Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, which was composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702\">https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702</a>.

The Working Group has another call later next week that involves the whole group, and might involve more calls before proceeding further into voting for the Uniswap Delegate Reward initiative.</p>\n<p>While some groups likely spent more time than others, generally, the contribution hours so far have been less than 30 hours. And in good faith as well as reasonable expectation, we believe that it should be less than 40 hours even if considering further contributions in the future. Therefore, using 200 USD per hour similar to the Accountability Committee, the proposal seeks 64,000 USD (40 hours * 8 members * 200 USD per hour) worth of UNI (which will be more specified in the number of UNI tokens during the onchain voting if this passes the offchain vote) to be at maximum distributed to the Working Group. The amount will be first sent to the multisig held by the Accountability Committee. In reality, there will likely be some leftover budget and believe that considering the Accountability Committee has various functions and initiatives, the leftover can be used as the operation or initiative budget for the Committee in the future.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-retroactive-reward-for-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23709\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-retroactive-reward-for-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23709","pubDate":"Sat, 20 Apr 2024 19:28:29 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-23709"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-retroactive-reward-for-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23709.rss","#text":"[RFC] Retroactive Reward for Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group"},"filter":false},{"title":"Findings from Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group","dc:creator":"Doo_StableLab","category":"Governance-Meta","description":"<p>Hello Uniswap Community, we have formed a Working Group to assess the current landscape of Uniswap governance and delegate responsibilities, all to build the framework for a successful Delegate Reward Initiative. After over a month of research and response gathering, we are happy to share our findings.</p>\n<p>The Working Group’s tasks were split into three groups:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Stakeholder Interviews</strong><br>\n<strong>2. Evaluating existing delegate composition, roles, contributions, and responsibilities</strong><br>\n<strong>3. Conducting market research to determine best practice</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group 1 : Stakeholder Interviews</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aim:</strong><br>\nConsolidate feedback from stakeholder interviews across Active, Small, and Inactive Delegates, Large Investors, and the Foundation regarding the proposal to introduce rewards for Uniswap delegates.</p>\n<p>The primary goal was to evaluate the community’s sentiment towards delegate rewards, understand the motivations of current delegates, and understand the goals that delegates and the broader stakeholder group hope to achieve with delegation writ large. The consensus points towards the need for a formal compensation scheme for delegates, though perspectives on implementation, oversight, and value vary.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>\nThere was a general consensus across most categories that a compensation program for delegates could improve participation quality and dedication. However, the enthusiasm varied, with those deeply involved in governance showing the strongest support.</p>\n<p>The interviews illustrated a variety of concerns and reservations about delegate compensation across different stakeholder groups, ranging from the potential for misaligned incentives to the practical challenges of implementing such systems.</p>\n<p>The primary reasons for supporting compensation were to ensure active participation, professionalize the delegate role, and align delegates’ activities with the strategic goals of the DAO.</p>\n<p>Alternatives were also proposed, including defining better paid committees with discrete scopes and experimentation with futarchy and information markets.</p>\n<p>In contrast, those less active or indirectly affected by governance outcomes, such as Liquidity Providers and Inactive Delegates, were less clear on the value and urgency of rewards, but recognized the potential benefits of incentivizing high-quality governance contributions.</p>\n<p>Full research can be found here: <a href=\"https://butterd.notion.site/Uniswap-Delegate-Rewards-Stakeholder-Interviews-2ff124cbfd4a4203ae4327f096bb1533\">https://butterd.notion.site/Uniswap-Delegate-Rewards-Stakeholder-Interviews-2ff124cbfd4a4203ae4327f096bb1533</a></p>\n<p><strong>Group 2 : Evaluating existing delegate composition, roles, contributions, and responsibilities</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aim:</strong><br>\nEvaluate existing delegate composition, roles, contributions, and responsibilities via quantitative and qualitative analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>\nDelegates help with the governance security. And their role has been becoming more important as the time goes, evidenced by the number of voters dropping but the voting power still being holding due to mostly delegates participating. Delegates contribute to discussions, voting, writing, reviewing proposals as well as participating in various working groups. Therefore, there’s time and effort put in being a delegate in the DAO ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Full research can be found here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZAFCBSQP-VeqU-uo0mdyi7RgsbCsboN5GRp25GCoCRE/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZAFCBSQP-VeqU-uo0mdyi7RgsbCsboN5GRp25GCoCRE/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<p><strong>Group 3: Conducting market research to determine best practice</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aim:</strong><br>\nEvaluate other models for delegate compensation in the ecosystem to identify possible best practices for the Uniswap DAO to model. This approach aims to build on observed successes in protocols that have a similar mission and delegate profile to Uniswap, and ultimately save time while iterating on models that are already working.</p>\n<p>We chose to explore the Maker DAO and AAVE delegate compensation programs. These were chosen because they both have a track record of observed success and the programs appeared to match the scale of participants that we believe a Uniswap Delegate program would include.</p>\n<p>In this report, we present a high-level overview of both programs followed by a conclusion that identifies components of each that we believe would be of value to a Uniswap delegate compensation program.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>\na.Delegates’ compensation should be based on their commitment to the protocol based on criteria that are specific, quantifiable, and objective.</p>\n<p>b.Should include periodicity to remove stale delegates and add fresh delegates.</p>\n<p>c.Compensation should include gas fee component</p>\n<p>d.DAO’s should assess their own unique needs</p>\n<p>e.Limits should be set.</p>\n<p>Full research can be found here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DCRQeDt3VJGDbcUWnxURMGiFRBC68SsBJGqhF864Cns/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DCRQeDt3VJGDbcUWnxURMGiFRBC68SsBJGqhF864Cns/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>-We will appreciate the community’s feedback on those findings. We will potentially proceed to offchain votes.</p>\n<p>-We will also soon be posting a RFC to compensate Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group members for their time and effort so far and potential further contributions for a short term. It will be sent to Multisig held by the Accountability Committee, in which any leftover will be used for any future initiatives by the Accountability Committee.

I am here to paint a picture of a world where Uniswap Labs loses the case against the SEC.</p>\n<p>Token and Security:</p>\n<p>The world would be better off if the SEC prevails. We’ve already witnessed a reality where it emerges victorious. In this scenario, Venture Capital privately raises funds at low valuations akin to accredited investors in the equity realm. All the value is siphoned away, and airdrops serve as golden parachutes for founders and VCs. These parachutes unfold over years through slow selling. There’s no incentive to generate value for the token in which people have come to believe. While a glimmer of hope exists for fee switches, token burns, and token memberships, implementing these could land those with the golden parachute in trouble for making the token resemble too much of a “security.”</p>\n<p>The Revolving Door of Nepotism:</p>\n<p>Insiders further extract value. Individuals closest to the information make moves to benefit themselves. A significant LP in the UNI pool withdrew funds and transferred them to Binance before the announcement of the fee switch transition. Upon reflection, it served as an excellent exit liquidity move. Who informed this person?</p>\n<p>Former labs members or friends of labs members seek significant sums of UNI tokens for equity in competing products or get aquired with little value add to other similar products, or look for users to donate to pay lawyers to case fires. Is this truly a user-first world? Or is it still reminiscent of traditional markets where those privy to information extract value from the public?</p>\n<p>Uniswap Losses, Good:</p>\n<p>The SEC should compel VCs and founders to burn the UNI acquired in private rounds—pre-airdrop. The airdropped and treasury tokens are the only legitimate ones. Those who have exploited their positions of power should only claim rights to these tokens at their fair user value. What have VCs done to enhance the protocol? Nothing. If they did, it would likely be deemed a security. They exist to create artificial value and subsequently destroy it. To rectify the system, the VC model must be dismantled to foster real value, and the SEC prevailing would aid in this endeavor. They would mandate the shutdown of the Uniswap Labs frontend, which raises fees without informing users. Its value lies in trust, yet that trust has been monetized to the detriment of users.</p>\n<p>FOSS Frontend Focus:</p>\n<p>With VC and founder tokens burned and the privately owned frontend shuttered, we can rebuild. Utilize voting and the treasury to finance genuinely open-source frontends. These frontends could specialize in various routes, communities, and user personalization. Direct use cases and fees toward liquidity, loyalty programs, and rewards. Rectify the liquidity layer of the internet.</p>\n<p>If the SEC wins, may the users triumph. It would usher in a world distinct from today’s—one where UNI can stand alongside BTC as decentralized infrastructure.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/sec-vs-uniswap-labs-is-losing-good/23646\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/sec-vs-uniswap-labs-is-losing-good/23646","pubDate":"Sat, 13 Apr 2024 20:51:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-23646"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/sec-vs-uniswap-labs-is-losing-good/23646.rss","#text":"SEC vs Uniswap Labs - Is losing good?"},"filter":true},{"title":"RFC - Options for Supporting DeFi Education Fund","dc:creator":"Doo_StableLab","category":"Proposal Discussion","description":"<p>This is a parallel proposal regarding <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-supporting-the-defi-education-fund/23631\">DeFi Education Fund (DEF) 's recent proposal for 1 million $UNI</a>  , which means we will post it when DEF’s proposal is up, but just with more options so the community has more choices regarding how they want to support DEF.

The threat that misguided policies and overreaching regulators pose to DeFi has never been clearer. This proposal is to provide DEF with one million UNI tokens to support them in fulfilling their mission.</p>\n<p><em>See our CLO Amanda Tuminelli <a href=\"https://unchainedcrypto.com/gary-genslers-case-against-uniswap-does-the-sec-even-stand-a-chance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">discuss our recent work</a> on Unchained this morning.</em></p>\n<p>DeFi promises to revolutionize how people engage in economic activities. In particular, the openly accessible and decentralized characteristics of DeFi protocols means that anyone with an internet connection and a wallet can participate in the global economy in a way that would not be possible without DeFi. To do so, DeFi upends the structure of traditional financial services and related policy making approaches. That upending has brought with it intense interest, suspicion, and hostility from entrenched interests and regulatory bodies around the world.</p>\n<p>DEF has defended DeFi from legislative threats that would require DeFi developers to implement protocol access restrictions or requirements designed for CeFi businesses; regulatory proposals that would mandate centralization if finalized; and in the courts against overzealous regulators. Indeed, in late March, we sued the SEC over its policy on airdrops and its campaign of regulation by enforcement that is crippling DeFi and crypto development and participation in the United States.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, DeFi’s policy challenges have become more real, more imminent, and more numerous. For example, in the U.S. alone, there are at least half a dozen bills actively under consideration in Congress and two rulemakings pending finalization that would effectively prohibit DeFi development. Luckily, public policy education and advocacy has borne—and can continue to bear—fruit for DeFi.</p>\n<p>Without doubt, building a public policy environment welcoming of DeFi and decentralized governance will be a long and arduous struggle, but we know that Uniswap Governance shares our commitment to winning that debate—and it is winnable—so that the benefits of DeFi can be felt and enjoyed by as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>DEF is eager to continue leading the fight on behalf of DeFi. With additional resources, we can build out our team:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>super charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;</li>\n<li>expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;</li>\n<li>more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; and</li>\n<li>enhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from the myriad policy risks it faces while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing and appreciate your consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>DeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.</p>\n<p>At this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.</p>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.</p>\n<p>DEF focuses specifically on fighting for policy outcomes favorable to decentralized finance developers and users on the ground in Washington, DC. A summary of our past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US and around the world, below. This proposal would expand our budget so that we can expand our legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.</p>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>Team, Social, &amp; Contacts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/about\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Team</a>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/millercwl\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Miller Whitehouse-Levine</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amandatums\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Amanda Tuminelli</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbernstein6395\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Max Bernstein</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LazPieper\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lizandro Peiper</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://defieducationfund.substack.com/archive\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Weekly updates</a> on policy developments and activities</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTt5vI0P5MuBF2vq1UyhByKqmM6XbMp-twre8ahm_gs/edit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">12 Month Estimated Budget</a> (current burn)</li>\n<li>Historical financial <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/financial-information\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">information</a> (annual and monthly)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fund_defi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X</a></li>\n<li>Contact - Please reach out to discuss!\n<ul>\n<li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:miller@defieducationfund.org\">miller@defieducationfund.org</a></li>\n<li>Telegram: <span class=\"mention\">@millwl</span></li>\n<li>Twitter: <span class=\"mention\">@fund_defi</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The DeFi Education Fund is a nonprofit organization with a demonstrated history of being in the trenches fighting for DAOs and decentralized finance. Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.</p>\n<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>\n<p><em>Why are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?</em></p>\n<p>We are seeking Uniswap Governance’s further support now for three primary reasons.</p>\n<p>First, we need a good sense of our longer term funding in order to expand our efforts and take on the long term projects that our work often requires, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will likely take a total of at least two years from start to finish. Our lawsuit against the SEC will probably last several years. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting those efforts, we would not have been able to take them on at all. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.</p>\n<p>Second, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States would cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects while also expanding our day to day efforts and team.</p>\n<p>DeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.</p>\n<p><em>When and how would you plan on selling this proposal’s tokens?</em></p>\n<p>It is important to us that DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. Upon passage, one million $UNI tokens would be transferred to DEF’s on-chain Coinbase $UNI <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xb39cb7Eb25CE07470Fb59F7548979Fae0Bb85824\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">wallet</a>. We will hold half of any tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will not sell any tokens without pre-disclosing a sales plan in writing. For example,</p>\n<p><em>What about the tokens from the 2021 proposal?</em></p>\n<p>We received our initial grant of one million $UNI tokens from the Uniswap Governance in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens shortly thereafter. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18 month written <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/post/def-provides-update-on-our-funding\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sales plan</a>. We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.</p>\n<p><em>Why are you asking us for money and not other DAOs?</em></p>\n<p>We are, and we will definitely continue to “pass around the hat”! We seek Uni governance’s continued support as a community that is building for the long term. Uniswap Governance took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that Uni governance and other projects’ governance will continue to contribute to our work going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</strong></p>\n<p><em>Legal Advocacy</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEC v.

Treasury - In November 2023, we filed another <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_dc5e8345b3d34bd4af4d06663c12d413.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> related to the Tornado Cash sanctions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We argued that the use of privacy-protecting technology is normal and not inherently illicit and that Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) exceeded its statutory authority in issuing sanctions that included purely domestic transactions.</li>\n<li>Harper v. Internal Revenue Service - In October 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_492b137460ef4263aa43f3fcb946a1cd.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in a case involving a challenge to a “John Doe” summons the IRS sent to Coinbase that resulted in the collection of information (including information revealing on-chain wallet addresses) about 14,355 Americans (none of whom were accused of any wrongdoing prior to the summons) over a three-year period. Our brief explained the sweeping Fourth Amendment implications of indiscriminately collecting digital asset transaction information and how doing so is more revealing than in the context of TradFi.</li>\n<li>SEC v. Coinbase - In August 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_05b10d3583a647b08dd071727ab8b7f1.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in support of Coinbase. We explained how wallets and staking actually work and supported Coinbase’s arguments that it is not a broker through its wallet software, nor did it offer securities through its staking program.</li>\n<li>Coin Center v. Treasury - In June 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_aff0399d95324a94af6b5f6cd3e31b91.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in support of a challenge to OFAC’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment ag. In October 2022, Coin Center and several individuals sued Treasury, challenging OFAC’s designation of Tornado Cash smart contracts. The plaintiffs argued that doing so exceeded the Treasury’s authority, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the First Amendment. Our brief supported arguments that the sanctions were beyond the Treasury Department’s statutory authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act, made the point that Tornado Cash is an important privacy-protection tool, and argued that the sanctions designations made no sense when considering the realities of the technology at issue.</li>\n<li>Van Loon v. Treasury - In April 2023, we submitted our first <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_347cf86b54b540e9be5773f8560d62bc.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">brief</a> related to Treasury’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. In addition to Treasury’s lack of statutory basis for the actions, We argued that the downstream implications of sanctioning a software protocol will lead to not only a weakening of the digital asset industry, but will also seriously jeopardize law-abiding Americans’ financial privacy.</li>\n<li>CFTC v. Ooki DAO - In late 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) served Ooki DAO, alleging it is “illegally offering leveraged and margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets” without a Futures Commission Merchant designation or a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) program. The CFTC served “Ooki DAO” via a help chat box with a contemporaneous notice posted on a website purportedly affiliated with Ooki DAO. We filed a brief in the case explaining: “First, the Commission has named Ooki DAO as a defendant in this action, asserting that Ooki DAO is an “unincorporated association comprised of Ooki Token holders.” But nothing about the structure of a DAO inherently dictates that result. In many cases, DAOs lack any central organization or management, and many DAO token holders often lack coordination or common objectives. As a result, DAOs will often not be “associations” of any kind, and therefore will not be proper defendants in an enforcement action brought under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), which requires that a defendant be a “person” (defined to include “associations”). The Commission has not yet alleged facts sufficient to establish that Ooki DAO is an association, so its attempt to serve Ooki DAO here is premature.”</li>\n<li>Combatting crypto patent trolls: In September 2023, we took action to protect DeFi and crypto from invalid patent infringement claims. We filed a<a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_ed2f23226fbb4adaa53b86efa5d58f44.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> petition</a> with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to initiate an inter partes review and cancellation of all claims in a patent owned by True Return Systems LLC. TRS is a patent troll who first tried to sell the patent as an NFT, and when that didn’t work, sued both MakerDAO and Compound Protocol in federal court for alleged infringement of<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US10025797B1/en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> U.S. Patent No. 10,025,797</a>. Our petition argued that the technology that TRS purported to patent was not in fact TRS’s invention, but was instead very similar to oracle technology that had been in development and use for years prior to the patent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Regulatory Advocacy</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In January 2024, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_a5bb9050d8414cbab3f0285202464a29.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">urged</a> the Department of the Treasury to reconsider its proposed rule to classify crypto “mixing” transactions to be a “primary money laundering concern” subject to enhanced reporting requirements. Among the issues we commented on is the proposal’s all-encompassing definition of “mixing,” which would capture almost all crypto transactions and designate them to be “high risk.”</li>\n<li>In January 2024, we submitted <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_4bdb18a7e1b94bfea406dfbb0a0ffcc8.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our thoughts</a> on a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed rulemaking that could expand the CFPB’s supervisory authority to capture self-hosted wallets. We argued that the rulemaking should not move forward as it would further scramble the Federal government’s already-convoluted regulatory treatment of DeFi and crypto-related activities.</li>\n<li>In November 2023, we filed a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_40d4255857d142f2a1744be79f1dab3f.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">comment letter</a> regarding the Treasury Department’s proposed “broker” rulemaking. The proposed rule would introduce a brand new category of broker called a “digital asset middleman,” a new term that is essentially limitless in scope and creates brokers out of thin air in DeFi and, as we argue, runs contrary to the statute and legislative history. Furthermore, we argued that the proposal violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on warrantless searches and seizures of a person’s papers and effects because individuals do not voluntarily turn over their personal data to “digital asset middlemen” who themselves neither collect nor have any legitimate business reason to collect that information. For a plain language review of our issues with the rulemaking, read: “<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/11/15/congress-gets-the-runaround-from-regulators-again/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Congress Gets the Runaround From Regulators, Again</a>.”</li>\n<li>In October 2023, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_1dfebf33d77f40a0895314105ed47079.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to France’s Autorité de Marchés Financiers (AMF) concerning their DeFi regulatory discussion paper. Our comment letter addressed many topics including permissionless blockchain protocols, legal enforceability of smart contracts, off-chain elements, etc. Importantly, we addressed the legal liability of smart contract developers, arguing that smart contracts’ code is open-source for anyone to audit and make informed decisions. Furthermore, we argued that open-source code is a form of expression as it conveys ideas for societal change and demands protection. We also argued against the AMF’s proposal to create a government-run certification regime for smart contracts.</li>\n<li>In September 2023, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_94bb62e0bac1428585c944bc06884bd2.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to a request for comment from the Senate Finance Committee regarding the taxation of digital assets. In our submission, we recommended Congress: 1) Revise Section 6050I so that it does not “deputize recipients of digital assets to collect and report information about their payers;” 2) Do not tax staking rewards until a sale or other disposition; 3) Do not apply wash sale rules to taxpayers who utilize digital assets as a form of currency; and 4) explicitly extend the application of section 1058’s nonrecognition rule to “loans” of actively traded fungible tokens.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we submitted a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_e73f5656c9a047788521cf09259db7a4.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response </a>to a consultation from HM Revenue and Customs, the United Kingdom’s tax, payments, and customs authority, regarding “the taxation of DeFi involving the lending and staking of cryptoassets.” At a high-level, our submission noted that any changes to the tax regime that concern DeFi must: be flexible to account for future innovation; exhibit clarity and simplicity to promote compliance by minimizing the burden on taxpayers; and align with the underlying economic substance of a typical DeFi transaction.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we submitted a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_dbc796a8e44644539ffcd4722e1b442a.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response </a>to Banque of France’s Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) regarding their discussion paper: “Decentralised’ or ‘Disintermediated’ Finance: What Regulatory Response?” Our primary arguments included that ACPR should not directly regulate miners and validators by establishing standards for public blockchains; a policy that would “force centralization” would eliminate the core innovations of public blockchains; and a framework for smart contract certification would require centralization and the inappropriate regulation of speech.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we filed our <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_f997b07bbb6d43b8a3b6c0626f57cdf3.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">third comment letter</a> on the SEC’s proposed “exchange” rulemaking. Our brief made two primary arguments: first, the proposal improperly reads and misapplies the Exchange Act and exceeds the SEC’s statutory authority and mandate under the Act; and second, the SEC has flatly failed to comply with numerous procedural and statutory rulemaking requirements.</li>\n<li>In August 2022, the DEF filed a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khRThXkBfev9uTTtSlakcckfKjP1_8TT/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response</a> to the U.S. Treasury Department’s request for comment on innovation in digital assets. In our response, we explained how DeFi protocols have the potential to benefit consumers, investors, and businesses in the United States and around the world by creating accessible financial infrastructure usable by any individual with an internet connection.</li>\n<li>In June 2022, we <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y6_UbL2DBMvICeuhdENSGGWPJrZCBAWM/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to Abu Dhabi’s DeFi consultation, in which we expressed our view that decentralization and disintermediation serve important societal objectives and that forcing the reintroduction of intermediation via legal obligations is a misguided approach to DeFi that would undermine its core potential and innovation.</li>\n<li>In June 2022, In our second <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1inWXw7MSO8VjrbuPro8izeewgmRGNC9r/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">letter</a> on the SEC’s exchange rulemaking, we argued that the proposed rule represents an improperly static regulatory response to a dynamic innovation and therefore needs to be reconsidered in total.</li>\n<li>In May 2022, we <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GC4QPms1JxzrBr7sLDlSzoVVk3EcTsNP/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commented</a> on the SEC’s “dealer” rulemaking, which could not only subject large DeFi market participants to the threat of arbitrary SEC enforcement actions but also, potentially, capture liquidity pools themselves as so-called “dealers” under the securities laws. But how would it do so? In what way? The SEC did not say when it proposed the rule nor when it later finalized the rule in early 2024, which we expect to see challenged in court. .</li>\n<li>In April 2022, we submitted the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cjQIDH3VE9303k-r55lQFfn1v-tH5l0n/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">first</a> of three comment letters on the SEC’s “exchange” rulemaking, which would de facto ban DeFi protocols in the United States. We argued that the Proposal’s expanded definition of an “exchange” is so broad that it could be interpreted to cover DeFi market participants, yet the rule didn’t specify which or why—it didn’t even mention “crypto,” “DeFi,” or “digital assets” once. In January 2023 in response to these concerns, the SEC released 167 pages of additional information explaining that the proposal does apply to DeFi and crypto, which we also responded to.</li>\n<li>In April 2022, we submitted a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kaURtD9UIFBaB4mMkcZXRi15uGJ5d3dK/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">comment letter</a> to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on its proposed <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/oecd-seeks-input-on-new-tax-transparency-framework-for-crypto-assets-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.htm\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">framework</a> for tax reporting in the digital asset ecosystem. Broadly, when it comes to DeFi, the proposal fits squarely in the “how do we apply existing regulations and tactics to innovative systems” camp. This concept would force the creation of intermediaries where they do not exist for tax reporting purposes, a concept that the Treasury Department is now attempting to enshrine in the United States (see November 2023 comment letter on the IRS’s proposed “broker” rulemaking).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Legislative Advocacy</em></p>\n<p>The past year has yielded some fruit in the industry’s push for crypto-specific legislation, but legislation is still a few years out, in our view. In July, The House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) voted, with bipartisan support, to advance the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/20/us-house-republicans-introduce-crypto-oversight-bill-to-protect-investors/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act</a>, a bill that would create a regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S. That same month, the HFSC advanced a bill to establish a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4766/BILLS-118hr4766ih.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">federal regulatory regime</a> for stablecoins.</p>\n<p>More recently, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce passed the <a href=\"https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/H_R_Deploying_American_Blockchains_Act_Reps_Bucshon_and_Blunt_Rochester_e4ce972799.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Deploying American Blockchains Act</a> (by a 46-0 margin), which would direct the chief of the Department of Commerce “to promote the competitiveness of the United States related to the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology.” While these bills are not perfect, we’re pleased that Congress has taken a serious approach to these matters.</p>\n<p>There’s another factor that gives us hope for the long-term chances of good legislation passing both chambers. And that is the willingness of Congressional offices and policymakers to engage with DEF and learn about the foundational aspects of the technology. We do “DeFi Demos” on Capitol Hill and advocate for policies welcoming of DeFi and DAOs. We explain why we believe in DeFi and why government officials and elected representatives should be just as curious as we are as to how this technology can improve the lives of their constituents. Away from sensational media headlines and televised hearings, one can see that a better, more open future for DeFi is developing.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we’ve provided a perspective from DeFi’s corner on the following federal legislation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>H.R. 1122, CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act</li>\n<li>H.R. 1177/S. 427, Financial Freedom Act of 2023</li>\n<li>H.R. 1414.

This, coupled with an optimized database, SeiDB, ensures that Sei can support high-volume applications without compromising speed or efficiency. Since Uniswap is yet to be tested in an alternative execution environment, it’s worth exploring how this deployment will affect the DEX’s usage and performance. No alterations to the Uniswap contracts will have to be made for this deployment as Sei v2 brings byte-code EVM compatibility–this mitigates concerns around security.</p>\n<p>Sei Foundation has committed up to $1M of liquidity for bootstrapping Uniswap-specific pools (see “Liquidity Bootstrapping and Incentives” below), with a firm plan of introducing $400k across three initial pools on day-one of the deployment. The other $600k will be split into 2 tranches of $300k. Each tranche will be deployed on a quarterly basis, depending upon Uniswap’s activity from the previous quarter. Sustained growth on Sei means that we will receive more liquidity. In 7 days, we will also post a vote that will allow the Uni DAO to determine whether or not we should use treasury $UNI to bolster incentives for this deployment.</p>\n<p>This proposal will utilize Wormhole for cross-chain message passing, Oku Trade will act as the deployment’s frontend, and GFX Labs will take care of the contract deployment.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-stakeholders-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#proposal-stakeholders-2\"></a>Proposal Stakeholders</h1>\n<p>The following list of stakeholders is present to transparently communicate which entities and individuals are involved in proposal creation and implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposer: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/aranadigital\">@AranaDigital</a></strong><br>\n<em>This entity is responsible for authoring the proposal &amp; managing the governance process</em></p>\n<p><strong>Deployer: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labsGFX\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GFX Labs</a></strong><br>\n<em>This entity is responsible for the technical deployment of the contracts on the target chain</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>GFX Labs will help deploy the v3 contracts on Sei and has a track record of safely deploying Uniswap v3 on various EVM-compatible chains</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Frontend: <a href=\"https://oku.trade/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Oku Trade</a></strong><br>\n<em>The initial frontend where users can interact with the new Uniswap v3 deployment</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oku is built and managed by GFX Labs</li>\n<li>Oku was seeded by a Uniswap Foundation grant in 2022</li>\n<li>Oku supports twelve chains and continues to aid Uniswap’s expansion to new protocols</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: Oku Trade has become the DAO’s go-to third party front-end for Uniswap deployments since the canonical front-end is owned and operated by Uniswap Labs</p>\n<p><strong>Bridge Provider: <a href=\"https://wormhole.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Wormhole</a></strong><br>\n<em>This is the cross-chain messaging solution selected for this deployment</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wormhole serves as the governance messaging provider to five Uniswap deployments: BNB, Celo, Gnosis, Rootstock, and Moonbeam.

The EVM and Cosmwasm contracts will be composable, able to communicate with one another, preventing liquidity and user fragmentation. Tooling for EVM-based dapps will also remain familiar, requiring no changes to RPC, wallet, and dev tooling setups.</p>\n<p>Uniswap has previously discussed potential deployments on alternative VMs, however, these conversations have so far fizzled out due to the complexity of rewriting the existing Uniswap contracts. For instance, a proposal was created to <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-starknet/19938\">deploy Uniswap on StarkNet</a>, but to carry this through, the Uniswap code would need to be transpiled from Solidity to Cairo. Such a move is subject to security issues, which the DAO has currently elected not to contend with. The parallelized EVM environment is now introducing an opportunity for Uniswap to explore a “different” VM without rewriting the v3 contracts.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/6e7efb941bd3b51a0c015d1d243f10636684eba8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fLuA1kpdQCCluOMpPlYvDMX1HS0.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/6e7efb941bd3b51a0c015d1d243f10636684eba8_2_690x383.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"fLuA1kpdQCCluOMpPlYvDMX1HS0\" width=\"690\" height=\"383\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/6e7efb941bd3b51a0c015d1d243f10636684eba8_2_690x383.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/6e7efb941bd3b51a0c015d1d243f10636684eba8_2_1035x574.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/6e7efb941bd3b51a0c015d1d243f10636684eba8.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"595F61\"></a></div><br>\n<em><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sei Blog</a></strong></em><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"optimistic-parallelization-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#optimistic-parallelization-5\"></a>Optimistic Parallelization</h2>\n<p>To further elaborate on the execution environment, we must highlight Sei’s rollout of optimistic parallelization. By enabling transactions to be processed in parallel rather than sequentially, Sei v2 enables significantly increased throughput and reduced txn fees.

Here’s where we need to mention the concept of state access, which is simply the ability for a txn to read/write to a blockchain’s state. State access plays a vital role in the efficiency and reliability of a blockchain when considering different approaches to parallelization—optimistic and deterministic. Although both parallelization strategies aim to scale blockchains via higher throughput, their methodologies for handling state access significantly influence their performance, security, and complexity.</p>\n<p>Sei v2 utilizes optimistic parallelization, where transactions are processed in parallel under the assumption that they will not conflict or interfere with each other’s state changes. This approach optimistically assumes that concurrent transactions can access and modify the blockchain state without creating inconsistencies. If conflict arises, then sequential re-execution of the txns is needed. Deterministic execution requires developers to assign the parts of state that can be accessed, but these assignments require more developer overhead. Hence, for Uniswap, it’s comparatively easier to deploy on an optimistically parallelized chain.</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://forum.sei.io/t/optimistic-concurrency-control/28?ref=blog.sei.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this page</a> to learn more about how Sei addresses conflict resolution via Optimistic Concurrency Control.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"seidb-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#seidb-6\"></a>SeiDB</h2>\n<p>More txns also means more problems, specifically around state management. If a blockchain cannot effectively manage high throughput at the state/storage level, it encounters another bottleneck. This undermines the advantages initially gained from employing a parallel execution environment.</p>\n<p>That’s where SeiDB comes in.</p>\n<p>Sei Labs has redesigned their database for high-performance storage, making sure that information is organized, stored, and accessed efficiently.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/1/1a5f86a08d574302888ddddc2eaf25e9bae25a4d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3Lj4NUKv8bKQSsaoKDkt0p9d2QB.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1a5f86a08d574302888ddddc2eaf25e9bae25a4d_2_432x375.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"3Lj4NUKv8bKQSsaoKDkt0p9d2QB\" width=\"432\" height=\"375\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1a5f86a08d574302888ddddc2eaf25e9bae25a4d_2_432x375.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1a5f86a08d574302888ddddc2eaf25e9bae25a4d_2_648x562.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1a5f86a08d574302888ddddc2eaf25e9bae25a4d_2_864x750.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"171816\"></a></div><br>\n<em><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://x.com/rhinostake/status/1750738751729393735?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@rhinostake on X</a></strong></em><p></p>\n<p>Operationally, efficiency and performance is achieved by separating state store (SS) and state commit (SC). This bifurcation is designed to optimize Sei for two requirements: handling vast historical data and processing new transactions efficiently.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>SS pertains to historical data. By organizing data as raw key values while minimizing unnecessary metadata, SeiDB ensures that historical records–encompassing txns, state changes, and other relevant data–are stored in a compact and accessible manner. This makes it easier to conduct auditing, transaction verification, and node synchronization. Such storage efficiency helps mitigate potential issues related to state bloat, ensuring that Sei remains scalable and efficient as it grows, not falling subject to diminishing performance from scale.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SC deals with the processing and validating of new transactions by performing state changes in-memory and streamlining access to the most recent state information. This way, SeiDB reduces the need for intensive Input/Output operations, enabling faster transaction validation and commitment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above architecture positions Sei in a place to aptly deal with high-volume applications.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-sei-ecosystem-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#the-sei-ecosystem-7\"></a>The Sei Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>Sei v2’s efficient design is meant to introduce an influx of applications that have not been previously possible due to the limited EVM design space. SVM and MoveVM chains will act as the direct architectural competitors to Sei going forward since they’ve been able to introduce unique applications like onchain order books. More parallelized EVMs will invariably be introduced in the coming months as well. Solana also has a parallelized EVM L2 called Neon, which has so far gained very little traction. This puts Sei in a strong position because it, ideally, enables high-throughput applications while simultaneously bringing forward a familiar developer environment.</p>\n<p>In the past few months, activity on the current Sei network has increased significantly, with organic growth around community-based NFT projects like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seiyansnft?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Seiyans</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheColonyNFT__\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Colony</a>.

From a legal as well as technical perspective, alterations to the subdomain don’t hold any weight–it’s merely a place onchain that the DAO can recognize v3/v2 deployments across various EVM chains. This way, there’s a public place to keep track of which deployments are official. Such recognition is important because it allows users and developers to ensure that the contracts they’re interacting with are representative of the real Uniswap (i.e. the Uniswap fork that has been approved by the DAO), thereby ensuring security and consistency across each fork.</p>\n<p>When the DAO currently approves deployments onchain, only the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth &amp; v2deployments.uniswap.eth text records are being altered. The actual contract deployment is completed by a third party, like <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/gfxlabs\">@GFXlabs</a>. In fact, the deployment has to be completed prior to the onchain vote since the text record alterations requires the</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The destination chain’s network number</li>\n<li>Bridge sender contract address on mainnet associated with the deployment</li>\n<li>UniswapV3Factory/UniswapV2Factory address on the destination chain</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/b/b19e853bbebcbf8879e30dd976d229e42fcad274.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pli8J397C6ZhH9o3aMgn5YLPSsY.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/b/b19e853bbebcbf8879e30dd976d229e42fcad274_2_690x372.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"pli8J397C6ZhH9o3aMgn5YLPSsY\" width=\"690\" height=\"372\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/b/b19e853bbebcbf8879e30dd976d229e42fcad274_2_690x372.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/b/b19e853bbebcbf8879e30dd976d229e42fcad274_2_1035x558.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/b/b19e853bbebcbf8879e30dd976d229e42fcad274_2_1380x744.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E8EAF0\"></a></div><br>\n<strong>Visit subdomains <a href=\"https://app.ens.domains/v3deployments.uniswap.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://app.ens.domains/%5Bdf848cb54b740ab5a6c1efa359bf318cc6e5e7b08d1134b9122466969831e32e%5D.uniswap.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a></strong><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"current-deployment-process-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#current-deployment-process-3\"></a>Current Deployment Process:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If a chain wants to deploy Uniswap, they typically connect with either the Foundation, the Accountability Committee, a delegate, or any adjacent party</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anyone is able to author an RFC, whether it be a delegate, the destination chain themselves, or whoever else.

To address the treasury’s volatility and underutilization, we propose forming the Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) to explore treasury management strategies aimed at achieving sustainability and growth for the DAO. This involves diversifying assets to stabilize the treasury and finding revenue-generating investments beyond the protocol’s core operations. The UTWG will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO based on 8 weeks of research and interviews with various entities and individuals familiar with treasury management and adjacent subject matters. A deliverable will correspondingly be released on the forum where we present at least two viable treasury management options for the DAO to begin pursuing. Both of these options will be presented as their individual RFC/RFP, ideally allowing treasury managers to present their products and services to the DAO. The UTWG will help facilitate this process.</p>\n<p>The proposal’s ultimate goal is to ensure the DAO’s long-term financial health and support the sustenance of Uniswap. However, there is one caveat–before implementing any of the proposed strategies, in other words, before moving any $UNI to and from the treasury, we must have clarity around the legal implications of administering this program. There has to be a way to pay taxes and limit liability. We hope that a simultaneous discussion around, say, DUNA, or other legal frameworks, takes place. It seems unlikely that the DAO will be able to conduct treasury management if it doesn’t open itself up to adopting a legal architecture. Our hope is that while the Foundation and potentially another working group sort out the legal side, we are able to make some strides on treasury management research. Upon adoption of a legal entity, we can then hit the ground running by actually implementing the conclusions derived from the UTWG’s research.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"treating-the-uniswap-treasury-as-an-endowment-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#treating-the-uniswap-treasury-as-an-endowment-2\"></a>Treating the Uniswap Treasury as an Endowment</h2>\n<p>“Treasury” is a broad term that typically mirrors the nature of its underlying protocol. Some treasuries quite literally reflect a protocol’s balance sheet, where the holdings are used to cover capital expenditures, and income is either paid out as a dividend to token holders or used to further grow the protocol. Other treasuries are integral in managing risk, with Aave and Compound being prime examples. Then, some treasuries, like that of Uniswap, are structured more similarly to an endowment, where the DAO must manage a large pool of capital to further the sustenance of the protocol in the long-term.</p>\n<p>The concept of an endowment refers to a collective pool of assets held by a nonprofit institution. These assets are employed to support an institution perpetually, with a clear directive of aligning with the desires of the contributing donor(s). In Uniswap’s case, the DAO was established upon the creation of the $UNI token–and 43% of the total supply was endowed to the DAO.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/76000bea555babf3a291c78f45d60ff388183708.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gPSrm6ogenfWtXlnSvrMVNgnzcI.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/76000bea555babf3a291c78f45d60ff388183708_2_690x445.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"gPSrm6ogenfWtXlnSvrMVNgnzcI\" width=\"690\" height=\"445\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/76000bea555babf3a291c78f45d60ff388183708_2_690x445.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/76000bea555babf3a291c78f45d60ff388183708_2_1035x667.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/76000bea555babf3a291c78f45d60ff388183708.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DCAFD2\"></a></div><br>\n<em><strong>Source: <a href=\"https://blog.uniswap.org/uni\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap Labs</a></strong></em><p></p>\n<p>The goal of the DAO is to support Uniswap’s growth and development in a manner that aligns with the collective vision of the token holders and their entrusted cohort of delegates.

As of today, Uniswap’s treasury boasts nearly ~$6B of assets, larger than any other DeFi protocol. That number, however, is highly inflated due to the composition of the treasury. Nearly 100% of the treasury is solely composed of one asset: the native $UNI token. Hence, the value of the treasury, in dollar terms, should be massively discounted.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/7dfce21535664fe71e4026a570c2f767339a8fb3.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hYxtYi4xQ3NC0SdLbOUfEtA9Yc3.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/7dfce21535664fe71e4026a570c2f767339a8fb3_2_690x422.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hYxtYi4xQ3NC0SdLbOUfEtA9Yc3\" width=\"690\" height=\"422\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/7dfce21535664fe71e4026a570c2f767339a8fb3_2_690x422.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/7dfce21535664fe71e4026a570c2f767339a8fb3_2_1035x633.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/7dfce21535664fe71e4026a570c2f767339a8fb3.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F8F9\"></a></div><br>\n<em><strong>Source: DeepDAO</strong></em><p></p>\n<p>Imagine if a traditional endowment was allotted billions of dollars in a singular, volatile asset, with a directive of using that treasury to sustain its core business–preposterous, right? That’s exactly the position where Uniswap is. What’s more is that there’s no current plan to mobilize this treasury in a productive manner. There lies a large amount of dormant capital simply sitting in the treasury without any explicit plan to be utilized. From our perspective, there needs to be an initiative to spur this dormant capital into action, even if it means doing so little by little. <em><strong>The goal of this proposal is to create a committee to begin researching ways by which we can put this treasury into effect.</strong></em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-are-we-optimizing-for-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#what-are-we-optimizing-for-4\"></a>What Are We Optimizing For?</h2>\n<p><strong>This proposal optimizes for two variables:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> the DAO should be a self-sustaining entity, able to cover its future costs in perpetuity.</li>\n<li><strong>Growth:</strong> the DAO should utilize its capital to grow its principal $UNI allotment in terms of dollars, thereby further propelling the adoption of Uniswap and delivering value to relevant stakeholders.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sustainability is the bare minimum. It acts as a floor. Unless the $UNI price continues to increase forever, the DAO, whenever it reaches into its treasury reserves, is reducing its runway. Hence, the first objective in any treasury management initiative should be to diversify out of the native token and into a more stable asset, like a basket of stablecoins. One could go as far as stating that any $UNI held in the treasury should actually be written down to zero. This mindset, where <a href=\"https://uncommoncore.co/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">treasury $UNI is effectively treated as an unissued share,</a> should spur us towards diversification.</p>\n<p>Since crypto is prone to fat-tail events, the DAO should establish a more robust cushion in case the market crashes. In 2021, the Uni treasury value ran to nearly $19B, and it quickly fell into a limbo zone between $1.5B - $2B for nearly 1.5 years between Q2 2022 and Q1 2024. No endowment should be this volatile. We should be in a position where if the DAO needs to fund certain initiatives, there are reserves to draw from without causing significant impairment to the token price. For instance, when the Foundation needs to be funded again, it should ideally be the case that a large portion of those requested funds are given in the form of stablecoins for instant liquidity.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/d67aedddfa5e4da2746aa937e8fd07e7b408630c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uBnyiw9MMfCtcwwwqrz3ninSkVK.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d67aedddfa5e4da2746aa937e8fd07e7b408630c_2_690x428.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"uBnyiw9MMfCtcwwwqrz3ninSkVK\" width=\"690\" height=\"428\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d67aedddfa5e4da2746aa937e8fd07e7b408630c_2_690x428.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d67aedddfa5e4da2746aa937e8fd07e7b408630c_2_1035x642.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/d67aedddfa5e4da2746aa937e8fd07e7b408630c.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"141725\"></a></div><br>\n<em><strong>Source: TokenTerminal</strong></em><p></p>\n<p>Beyond mere diversification, the DAO needs to pursue growth. Currently there are no programs in place for the treasury to increase its net asset value beyond $UNI appreciation. This is where the treasury can be used to generate revenue, either from operating or non-operating activities. Let’s break this concept down–distinguishing between the operating and non-operating income for the DAO is important for defining the source of treasury growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Operating Income:</strong> Operating income would pertain to any income generated from the primary business activities of the protocol, which, in Uniswap’s case, is fees from swaps. Currently, the DAO does not collect any income from fees and likely won’t in the future under the Uniswap Foundation’s <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936\">recently proposed fee architecture</a>. <em><strong>The Uniswap DAO will therefore not be sustainable in the long-run by relying on income from operations–fees generated will most likely be paid out to token holders in full, leaving the DAO with near zero income. To that end, we must rely on non-operating activities to ensure the sustainability of the Uni DAO.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Non-Operating Income:</strong> All income not generated from fees falls into this category. If the Uniswap DAO does not plan on attaining revenue from operations, then it must utilize its current treasury to collect income via alternative methods–likely through yield-bearing strategies and investments. Reliance on non-operating income further establishes why the Uni treasury mirrors the setup of an endowment, where the long-term sustainability of the protocol is built on indirect investments detached from the protocol’s core operations. <em><strong>These methods are to be further explored, and the present proposal aims to pioneer such exploration.</strong></em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"working-group-details-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#working-group-details-5\"></a>Working Group Details</h2>\n<p>Based on the above reasoning, the UTWG will conduct 8 weeks worth of research into the types of treasury management initiatives that the DAO may reasonably pursue in the short-to-medium term. The group will note on the experience of treasury management practices of other DAOs, adopting practices that have historically worked well and conforming them to Uniswap’s current situation, along with the presentation of new models that we believe are potentially more effective. Considering treasury management has been a key aspect of many prominent DAOs like Maker and Aave to Lido and Gnosis, we believe that there are many case studies and frameworks that can be explored to ensure initial experiments will return positive results.</p>\n<p>The UTWG will also try to collaborate with those working on various legal developments including the recent <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/duna-for-daos/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Wyoming Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) Act</a>. This process may fall outside of the jurisdiction of the treasury committee and may require outsourcing entirely to another party. It’s vital that this treasury research is analyzed in the context of potential legal structures, and we won’t move forward with implementing our research unless there are proper legal frameworks in place. The Uniswap DAO has yet to formalize its opinions on how to set up legal entities, so this caveat may delay the implementation of the proposed treasury initiatives. The UTWG’s research may conclude that a legal working group should work in concert with the treasury group to effectively bring this program to fruition.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to emphasize that the deliverables of the UTWG will aim to highlight potential treasury management options rather than pinpointing specific service providers. If the committee comes to the conclusion that an RFP process is the ideal manner by which treasury managers should be appointed, for example, then one of the UTWG deliverables will be a call to action for various service providers. After ample discussion in the forum, the most promising service providers will qualify for a vote of confidence from the DAO. The elected members will then collaborate with the UTWG to implement a proposed treasury management initiative–granted a legal framework is in place. At this point, the working group will act as the liaison between the DAO and the service providers, ensuring proper accountability and transparency for the sake of the DAO.</p>\n<p>Note that it’s too early in the research process to conclude the exact operations of the treasury initiatives–the above paragraph simply outlines a potential order of operations, which is subject to change based on our research. <em><strong>Our goal is to simply present the DAO with an assortment of options, backed by interviews and research.</strong></em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-uniswap-treasury-working-group-members-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#the-uniswap-treasury-working-group-members-6\"></a>The Uniswap Treasury Working Group Members</h3>\n<p>The UTWG will be composed of four members. 2/4 members are listed below and are a part of working group zero (WG0).</p>\n<p><strong>StableLab</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>StableLab is a governance firm focused on professional delegation, DAO framework design, and product development.

This thread is meant to capture more community sentiment around this.</p>\n<p><strong>Within this thread, we have 2 objectives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1. Inform you on runway extension:</strong> Operationally, the UAGP swapped our treasury ARB to USD to secure runway and mitigate currency risk impacting our ability to fund projects.</li>\n<li><strong>2. Align with you on program extension:</strong> With our extended runway, we propose to extend the core program to a maximum of 3 more months.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"topic-1-arb-to-usdc-swap-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#topic-1-arb-to-usdc-swap-3\"></a>Topic 1: ARB to USDC Swap</h1>\n<p>Off the back of discussions at GovSwap and aligning internally, the UAGP committee has decided to secure our program’s runway by converting a large proportion of the ARB in our treasury to USD to hedge against currency risk with ARB price fluctuations.</p>\n<p><strong>Key reasons for the decision are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our guiding objective for the UAGP is to enable builders to build, and provide value, for the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As such, we made the decision to swap a large portion of the ARB in our treasury to USDC, extending our runway and enabling us to fund almost twice as many projects as initially budgeted for at inception. This decision was made after initial discussions with delegates in Denver and after careful consideration of the potential impact of price volatility stemming from systemic risk and resulting from specific events (eg. ARB token unlocks).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Transaction in detail:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>On February 29th, we swapped 599k ARB within our treasury to USDC, which was executed at around ~$2/token, amounting to 1.195m USDC.</li>\n<li>All in all, a slippage of 0.25%, of which effectively the slippage was 0.17% and the rest was just price fluctuation/spread/others.</li>\n<li>See the discussed transaction here: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xa15eb0dda7189e1e46e920e833a4da4373f66ac05b1d25b4c793f64c636b61dd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xa15eb0dda7189e1e46e920e833a4da4373f66ac05b1d25b4c793f64c636b61dd</a></li>\n<li>A portion representing &lt;15% of our initial ARB allocation remains in the treasury to cover continued operational expenses of the UAGP committee and allow for potential program extension in the future (details below).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the price of ARB around the time of the UAGP’s inception, the program was allocated roughly ~$1.1m in USDC terms to direct towards funding projects that fit within our scope of core objectives. From that period, ARB token price has nearly doubled and our treasury has increased to ~$1.8m in USD terms (excl. amounts already paid out).</p>\n<h1><a name=\"topic-2-extension-of-the-uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#topic-2-extension-of-the-uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-4\"></a>Topic 2: Extension of the Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program</h1>\n<p><strong>Proposed extension</strong></p>\n<p>As described previously, the positive price action of ARB and our decision to secure our coffers has enabled us to fund almost 2x as many projects as initially anticipated.</p>\n<p>The increase in projects funded brings with them an extended period of assessment and tracking required, and as such:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’d like to extend the UAGP operation for up to a maximum additional 3 months depending on the quality of inbound applications (extending from ending in April ‘24 to July ‘24)</li>\n<li>Similarly, we want to block budget for an additional 6 months at 20% of full capacity for milestone-tracking and reporting, should that be necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to note that an increase in funding capacity does not necessarily equate to a proportional increase in program length due to the benefit of having already initiated and established a well-running program. More simply, the doubling in runway does not require a doubling in operational time/costs, given the biggest chunk of set-up costs and momentum creation has already been done.</p>\n<p><strong>UAGP Financial Overview</strong></p>\n<p>The UAGP has been operating for 4 months, and in that period has accepted 7 projects out of 93 applications. This resulted in reserving 586k UDSC to accepted projects to pay-out via milestones (103k USDC already paid out).</p>\n<p>Given the first month of operation was largely process initiation and set-up, we’ve averaged a rate of assessing ~31 applications per month and funded the selected ones with an average grant size of ~84k USDC.</p>\n<p>We plan to cease the committee’s operations once the final funds are distributed, or at that juncture, reassess and potentially request additional funding from Arbitrum based on the community’s perception of the program’s success.</p>\n<p><strong>What does that mean in practice?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Considering the remaining unallocated ~998k USDC in our treasury, we are now in the position to be able to fund a larger number of projects with an extension of the program, while maintaining the current assessment speed, we propose and extension for 3 months for all subsequent projects. This of course is not set in stone and will be educated by the quality level of applications.</li>\n<li>For the continuation of the operational management, we aim to reserve a maximum amount 109k ARB for the committee. This amount would be spent if all committee members would stay on board for another 3 months and work the maximum amount of hours (78k ARB), and includes another 6 months term to stay on with reduced capacity of 20% (31k ARB). We have been paid 100 ARB/hr since the beginning of the program bearing the up and down side for incentive alignment.</li>\n<li>In reality, as described above, we hope to meet the finalization of the program earlier and with less capacity needed considering our existing momentum and the rate of deal inflow we presently see.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Upon completion</strong></p>\n<p>When the UAGP committee is moving to an end we will either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pathway A:</strong> Propose extending the program and request additional funding from Arbitrum, provided the committee desires to proceed and the community views the initiative as successful.</li>\n<li><strong>Pathway B:</strong> Close down operation of the full committee and maintain a minimal capacity (20%) to see through tracking and reporting of existing Grants with a longer timeline, reporting at predefined periods to the DAO. In case this option is taken and there are excess funds (likely scenario) in the treasury, these funds will be sent back to the Uniswap Treasury / Airdrop contract, and the DAO can decide how to allocate those funds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-and-next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#timeline-and-next-steps-5\"></a>Timeline and Next Steps</h1>\n<p>We aim to provide ample time for feedback and discussion. While we have done significant pre-discussion on the ground in Denver we appreciate the importance of getting a wider consensus on this and your input, whether it’s voicing concerns, posing questions, or simply agreeing, would be valuable for our decision-making on topic 2.</p>\n<p>We plan to keep this discussion open for two weeks.

This will prevent the DAO from being pigeonholed by a singular, immutable implementation, thereby enabling further experimentation and allowing the DAO to effectively respond to issues with the current setup.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>We appreciate the Uniswap Foundation’s effort on the <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936\">protocol fee proposal</a> and look forward to supporting the proposal at the onchain vote. Overall, the implementation proposed is well thought out and provides a strong foundation for the execution of a fee switch to strengthen Uniswap and its governance.</p>\n<p>However, in the current proposal, the V3FactoryOwner.sol does not have a function to set a new owner to UniswapV3Factory.sol, making this a permanent change to the protocol. This is akin to locking a door and throwing away the key. If the proposal is approved, it will be impossible for anyone to alter the V3FactoryOwner.sol, which we believe is overly constrictive. Despite extensive analysis from several parties, it’s still unknown how activated protocol fees and this new governance mechanism will impact the protocol once implemented–and assuming that the DAO gets the implementation right the first time around is too optimistic. Hence, opting for full immutability stifles experimentation.</p>\n<p>Since Uniswap V3 was launched 3 years ago, the DAO has had the power to use the setOwner() function of the UniswapV3Factory.sol contract. This capability has never been exploited, abused, or even used by governance or any bad actor. In addition, the DAO has shown its ability to steward the protocol over the course of the +40 proposals since V3’s deployment.</p>\n<p>This proposed amendment, if passed, will add a setOwner() function to the V3FactoryOwner.sol contract. In the case that delegates wish to transition to a new system due to the potential ineffectiveness of the current system, a setOwner() function is necessary to include in the V3FactoryOwner.sol contract, just as it is necessary to make the currently proposed upgrade by the Uniswap Foundation.</p>\n<p>Adding the setOwner() function would allow governance to make amendments to the current implementation. Removing this ability inhibits the jurisdiction of the DAO and partially signals a lack of trust in governance. The introduction of the setOwner() function requires very little code and will allow the DAO to prudently respond to any potential limitations that arise with the current implementation.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"reasoning-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#reasoning-2\"></a>Reasoning</h1>\n<p><strong>The goal of the <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936\">Foundation’s proposal</a> is twofold:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>To make the DAO more robust by engaging more circulating $UNI in governance</li>\n<li>Create an economic incentive for $UNI holders to delegate their $UNI</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This amendment better accomplishes the above goals.

Note, we are not addressing the nature of the core protocol smart contracts or staking contracts–those are indeed immutable. This proposal is about the contracts related to Uniswap v3 fees. Such an area is nascent and lacks experimentation. The DAO and the Foundation are responsible for ensuring token holders and delegates are properly compensated under a fair fee collection and distribution system. Immutability hinders this experimentation and fetters v3 to an untested fee design…forever.</p>\n<p>To operationalize this concern, let’s turn to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/juanbug\">@juanbug</a>’s point, where he states that there’s a realistic concern that large holders would simply delegate their tokens to a burner wallet, or to themselves, without engaging in governance. Why would this pattern play out? Regulatory unclarity. The majority of the stake pool will be composed of $UNI from large token holders, likely VCs, with strict legal mandates. In effect, this does nothing except earn the staker yield and potentially shields them from delegate-delegator liability.</p>\n<p>If larger $UNI stakers do opt into delegating to a burn address to avoid the potential liability concerns, then the Foundation’s goal of increasing governance participation could see the opposite effect–holders would still collect staking fees without contributing anything to governance. With the proposed amendment, the protocol could introduce a revised system to push delegation to active delegates or encourage new delegates to appear.</p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936\">the topic</a> was introduced on the forum, multiple ideas for improving the system or addressing its shortcomings have been mentioned.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/banteg\">@Banteg</a>’s <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936/39\">suggestion</a> is to implement a protocol-wide fee to combat the issue of setting per-pool fees, which may be unsustainable due to the large number of pools and the burden to protocol governance it would present. <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gauntlet-s-uniswap-protocol-fee-report-tldr-version/22607\">Gauntlet is currently working through a process</a> to ensure a smooth and gradual procedure for turning on fees on particular pools. The data-driven approach will take time and require delegates to be alert.</li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/juanbug\">@Juanbug</a>’s <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936/46\">point</a> that the system proposed doesn’t necessarily encourage delegation to active delegates and may lead to the continued limited participation of $UNI token holders in the protocol’s governance.</li>\n<li>Multiple posts asked about the decision to choose wETH as the payout token rather than other ERC20s. Under the existing system, changing to another token would be impossible. This amendment would allow future delegates that option.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, as experimentation within DeFi continues to expand, we can anticipate that more effective mechanisms and designs will be devised to enhance governance. Given the significant concerns regarding this proposal’s effectiveness in improving governance, restricting experimentation and confining V3 to a potentially ineffective design does not appear to align with the DAO’s best interests. We believe that V3 may better serve as the experimentation ground for governance incentivization, which could prevent issues with future Uniswap versions. If V4 will potentially cannibalize V3’s market share, then experimenting with V3 prior to introducing protocol fees to V4 is a sound approach.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"technical-implementation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#technical-implementation-4\"></a>Technical Implementation</h1>\n<p>Implementation of the setOwner() function is incredibly lightweight from a technical perspective and can be done in less than five lines of code in the v3factoryowner.sol.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">function setUniswapV3FactoryOwner(address _owner) external {\n    _revertIfNotAdmin();\n    FACTORY.setOwner(_owner);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The effect of this change would allow the DAO to implement a new v3factoryowner.sol.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"risks-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#risks-5\"></a>Risks</h1>\n<p>We appreciate that a fully immutable system would reduce the technical risks to the protocol because it would prevent a potential future bug from being introduced or causing operational harm to infrastructure that may someday be built on the Uniswap Staker.</p>\n<p>The authors here believe the risk of locking ourselves into a totally new and operationally untested system represents a greater risk to the organization than the proposed technical change and potential future risk considerations.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#next-steps-6\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>To not significantly slow down the current process proposed by the Foundation, a Snapshot poll will be used to collect opinions via a vote from the delegates. There will be two options, “Accept amendment” or “Reject amendment.” If the “Accept amendment” is able to demonstrate a significant majority, then we would expect the onchain proposal put forth by the Foundation to include the change. The poll will go up immediately and end on March 8th.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we would like to reiterate our general support for the proposed mechanism and our appreciation for the Uniswap Foundation’s efforts to bring this proposal to the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>15 posts - 10 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v3-fees-factory-owner-amendment/23187\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v3-fees-factory-owner-amendment/23187","pubDate":"Sat, 02 Mar 2024 23:10:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-23187"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v3-fees-factory-owner-amendment/23187.rss","#text":"Uniswap V3 Fees: Factory Owner Amendment"},"filter":false},{"title":"[Temperature Check] - Activate Uniswap Protocol Governance","dc:creator":"eek637","category":"Governance-Meta","description":"<h3><a name=\"edits-and-addendums-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#edits-and-addendums-1\"></a>Edits and Addendums</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Friday, March 1, 2024: <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xad7e3612d11d56b21f0b2274e4ce825163bc1873d0e2ef809a3a98733df992a7\">Snapshot Link</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a name=\"tldr-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#tldr-2\"></a>TL;DR</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The UF is proposing a large-scale upgrade to Uniswap protocol governance to incentivize active, engaged, and thoughtful delegation.

Specifically, we propose to upgrade the protocol so that its fee mechanism rewards UNI token holders that have delegated and staked their tokens.</p>\n<p>The UF team is often asked what success looks like for Uniswap governance. Quite simply, success for governance equates to the long-term sustainability and continued growth of the Protocol. Governance controls the Uniswap Treasury, and core parameters related to the Protocol’s long term sustainability (for instance, fees). In 5, 10, 20 years, Uniswap’s continued success – and whether it actually becomes the liquidity layer of the Internet – will have been the result of its delegates and the decisions they make.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, the UF has prioritized improvements to the delegation experience. We have provided delegates with the opportunity to launch their platforms (the Delegate Race), and with information they need to make good decisions (the Bridge Report). Next week at ETHDenver we are launching GovSwap, the first of a series of in-person gatherings oriented around producing good governance outcomes by defining a common purpose. Subsequent GovSwaps will take place at ETHcc and Devcon. For delegators, we funded and launched <a href=\"https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org\">Agora</a>, a platform that allows delegators to find delegates that will best represent their interests.</p>\n<p>As a result of these efforts, delegate activity has picked up, as evidenced by the increasing number of community-driven governance initiatives. For example, in the last three months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/59?chart=list\">successful vote ending soon</a> to pilot a program to incentivize the adoption of Uniswap V3 on non-mainnet chains (there are 16 non-mainnet deployments).</li>\n<li>10m tokens from the Protocol’s treasury <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-delegation-of-uni-to-active-but-underrepresented-delegates/22238\">were delegated</a> across 7 different delegates.</li>\n<li>Delegate-run <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-community-calls/22274\">Governance Calls</a> have begun to happen on the second Tuesday of the month.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, there is much more that can be done. Free-riding and apathy remain existential risks to the Uniswap Protocol’s sustainability. Less than 10% of circulating UNI is used to vote on a given proposal. Further, a large portion of existing delegation is “stale”. As of February 1 2024, 14 of the top 30 delegates by voting power had not voted over the last 10 proposals, and only 7 of these delegates have ever created a proposal.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to invigorate governance – incentivizing not only delegation but thoughtful and active delegation – by tying delegation to protocol fees. Specifically, we believe UNI token holders will be incentivized to choose delegates whose votes and engagement with the protocol will lead to the Protocol’s growth and success. If this proposal succeeds we believe we will see an influx of new delegation. And because existing delegators will be required to re-delegate to stake their tokens, we will see a shift of “stale” existing delegation to delegates who have proven their commitment to supporting the protocol. Further, this mechanism can run on its own into the future - continuing to incentivize engaged delegation, without requiring any additional facilitation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-of-proposed-technical-changes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#summary-of-proposed-technical-changes-4\"></a>Summary of proposed technical changes</h2>\n<p>The Uniswap Foundation has funded the research and development of the various components that are required to implement this proposal. Specifically, we have funded two new smart contracts which are designed to be deployed into and interact with the existing ecosystem of Uniswap contracts operating on-chain. If implemented by this governance proposal, they would:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upgrade Uniswap Protocol Governance to enable the permissionless and programmatic collection of protocol fees</li>\n<li>Distribute any protocol fees pro-rata to UNI token holders who have staked and delegated their votes</li>\n<li>Allow for governance to continue to control core parameters: which pools which are charged a fee, and the magnitude of the fee</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Below we provide a brief overview of the two new contracts. More technical detail can be found in the Appendix.</p>\n<p>The two new contracts are <a href=\"https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker/blob/main/src/V3FactoryOwner.sol\">V3FactoryOwner.sol</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker/blob/main/src/UniStaker.sol\">UniStaker.sol</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>V3FactoryOwner.sol allows for the programmatic, permissionless collection of protocol fees, and includes a mechanism which incentivizes the conversion of those fees into a common ERC20 for distribution to stakers, who have deposited UNI in Unistaker.sol. In order for this contract to work, it will need to become the owner of the UniswapV3Factory.</li>\n<li>UniStaker.sol manages delegation and fee distribution. Actors responding to the mechanism in V3FactoryOwner.sol deposit an ERC20 into UniStaker.sol to be distributed to stakers. UniStaker.sol is modeled after Synthetix’s battle-tested <a href=\"https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/StakingRewards.sol\">StakingRewards.sol</a> but extends that contract’s functionality in two key ways: 1) It requires accounts that stake to delegate their tokens, and 2) It enables (but does not require) accounts that stake to assign staking rewards to any other account.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#next-steps-5\"></a>Next steps</h2>\n<p>If governance is supportive of this initiative, we will move forward with this vote.

The specific fraction is adjustable by governance, and could be 0, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7, 1/8, 1/9, or 1/10. They are currently set to 0.</li>\n<li>Protocol fees are set on a pool by pool basis, and fees are accrued in both tokens that comprise the pool.</li>\n<li>The UniswapV3Factory is the core contract of Uniswap V3; it spins up individual pool contracts to which users can add liquidity and swap back and forth. The Owner of the Factory is the only contract which can turn on fees in a pool, and collect fees when they’ve been turned on. Currently, the owner is Uniswap Governance’s <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC\">Timelock</a> contract.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The proposed vote would change the owner of the UniswapV3Factory to be a deployment of V3FactoryOwner.sol.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"appendix-b-new-contract-descriptions-and-parameters-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#appendix-b-new-contract-descriptions-and-parameters-7\"></a>Appendix B: New contract descriptions and parameters</h3>\n<p>The smart contract piece of our proposed solution consists of two custom-built contracts, designed and written by Scopelift. This appendix discusses each of them.</p>\n<p><strong>V3FactoryOwner.sol</strong><br>\nThis contract allows for the programmatic, permissionless collection of protocol fees from the pools where they accrue while maintaining Uniswap Governance’s control over whether fees are turned on and their levels.</p>\n<p>The mechanism that enables fee collection sets up a continuous “race” wherein external parties (we contemplate this will include MEV bots, arbitrageurs, etc.) compete to claim the fees accrued by each pool once it becomes profitable to do so. The external party that claims the fee is required to deposit (in our recommended implementation) 10 WETH to a deployment of UniStaker.sol (detailed below). In other words, once the value of accrued fees exceeds 10 WETH (plus gas), a rational actor is incentivized to convert accrued fees to 10 WETH, which is sent directly to the UniStaker.sol contract.</p>\n<p>Additionally, V3FactoryOwner is configured to pass through the function calls from Uniswap Governance that are required to turn on and adjust protocol fees in any pool deployed from the Uniswap V3 Factory contract. Governance votes will still be required for these adjustments.</p>\n<p>In order for this contract to work, it will need to become the owner of UniswapV3Factory. This first vote, the Upgrade vote, will update the Owner of UniswapV3Factory to the address of a deployed instance of V3FactoryOwner.sol.</p>\n<p>V3FactoryOwner has four parameters that are configured at contract deployment.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Updateable by governance?</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>UF Recommended parameter</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Payout Token</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>The ERC20 used to pay out rewards to stakers.</td>\n<td>WETH</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Payout Amount</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>How much of the Payout paid in each discrete deposit.

Actors responding to the mechanism in V3FactoryOwner.sol deposit an ERC20 into UniStaker.sol to be distributed pro-rata to delegators.</p>\n<p>UniStaker.sol is modeled after Synthetix’s battle-tested StakingRewards.sol. UniStaker extends StakingRewards.sol’s functionality in two key ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It requires accounts to delegate their tokens in order to earn a share of protocol fees.</li>\n<li>It enables (but does not require) accounts that stake to assign staking rewards to any other account.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Updateable by governance?</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>UF Recommended parameter</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Admin</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>The address that can add addresses to the list of RewardsNotifiers.</td>\n<td>Uniswap Timelock address</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RewardsNotifiers</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>A list of addresses that defines <em>where</em> rewards can come from.</td>\n<td>V3FactoryOwner added to the list of RewardsNotifiers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RewardsToken</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>The token UniStaker expects to be deposited and distributed to stakers.</td>\n<td>WETH</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>StakeToken</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>The token users must deposit and delegate to be eligible to earn RewardsTokens.</td>\n<td>UNI</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reward Duration</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>The timeframe over which rewards are distributed.

A shorter one will drip them more quickly.</td>\n<td>30 days</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Appendix C: Fee distribution logic</strong><br>\nThe rate at which accrued protocol fees are distributed to UNI stakers, as well as the size of a stakers’ reward, are determined by several variables. Specifically, the inputs are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reward token (set on UniStaker and V3FactoryOwner). This is the denomination of the rewards distributed to UNI stakers.</li>\n<li>Reward amount (set on V3FactoryOwner). This is the total reward amount which is distributed across stakers, per deposit. A higher reward amount means that fees will be claimed and distributed to stakers less frequently than with a lower reward amount, all other factors held equal.</li>\n<li>Reward duration (set on UniStaker). The length of time over which a given reward amount is distributed, once it has been deposited in UniStaker. A longer reward duration period incentivizes stakers to stake and thus delegate for a longer period of time to receive the same amount of fees, all other factors held equal.</li>\n<li>Staker’s share of total UNI staked: Protocol fees are distributed across stakers pro-rata over a given block. If a staker stakes a larger proportion of total UNI staked in a given block, they will receive comparatively more fee rewards, all other factors held equal.</li>\n<li>Trade volume. Higher trading volumes means fees are collected and distributed to stakers more frequently than lower trading volumes, all other factors held equal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that every time a deposit happens, the reward duration “clock” resets. All outstanding Reward Amounts are added to the newly deposited Reward Amount, and that amount is distributed over the subsequent Reward Duration.</p>\n<p>To illustrate these distribution mechanics using an example, assume that we have defined the contract variables as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Payout Token as WETH</li>\n<li>The Payout Amount as 10</li>\n<li>The Reward duration as 30 days</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every time a little bit more than 10 WETH worth of fees accrue in a pool, a third party is incentivized to collect them and distribute 10 WETH into UniStaker. From there they will be allocated pro-rata to stakers over a 30 day period.</p>\n<p><em>Example 1: Simple Case</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume Alice has deposited 10 UNI to UniStaker and that she is the only person to have done so. Her stake makes up 100% of total UNI staked.</li>\n<li>On the first day she staked, a reward (10 WETH) is deposited into UniStaker.</li>\n<li>The reward amount is ~0.33 WETH per day, 10 WETH divided by the reward duration 30 days.</li>\n<li>Alice earns ~.33 WETH per day  for 30 days</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Example 2: New Rewards Distribution</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume Alice has deposited 10 UNI to UniStaker and that she is the only person to have done so. Her stake makes up 100% of total UNI staked.</li>\n<li>On the first day she staked, a reward (10 WETH) is deposited into UniStaker.</li>\n<li>Alice earns ~.33 WETH per day.</li>\n<li>A new reward distribution of 10 WETH arrives on day 3. At this point, the rewards being disbursed reset to include this new deposit. On Day 3, there is ~9 WETH outstanding from reward 1. There is now a total of ~19 WETH to be disbursed over the subsequent reward duration of 30 days.</li>\n<li>The reward rate Alice receives is now ~.633 WETH per day (~19 WETH divided by 30 days)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Example 3: New Stakers</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume Alice is receiving ~0.633 WETH per day.</li>\n<li>A new staker, Bob, stakes 10 UNI. Alice and Bob each make up 50% of total UNI staked. Alice and Bob will now split the 0.633 WETH pro-rata for the duration of the period (0.3165 per day), or until a new deposit arrives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"appendix-d-documentation-security-and-audits-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#appendix-d-documentation-security-and-audits-8\"></a>Appendix D: Documentation, security and audits</h3>\n<p>Both V3FactoryOwner and UniStaker are fairly lightweight - the total combined lines of code is near 550. But if put into production, both are critical to the future of the Uniswap ecosystem. With that in mind we have invested considerable resources into their security.</p>\n<p>Both contracts were developed by Scopelift. The code has meticulous in-line documentation and there is user-facing technical documentation <a href=\"http://docs.unistaker.io\">here</a>. The repository contains a <a href=\"https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker/tree/main/test\">robust test suite</a> including unit, integration, and invariant tests. Scopelift has also written <a href=\"https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker/tree/main/script\">scripts</a> for the governance proposals that will be required to transfer the ownership of the V3Factory contract and subsequently to interact with the V3FactoryOwner.</p>\n<p>The smart contracts have been highly scrutinized by multiple teams including Trail of Bits, whose final audit report is forthcoming. The audit flagged one issue that is documented <a href=\"https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker/issues/59\">here</a>. The full report from that audit will be added to the contract repo when their technical writing team has completed their work.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Uniswap Foundation is sponsoring a 10-day <a href=\"https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-02-unistaker-infrastructure\">Code4rena contest </a>which will further harden the contracts. That contest will begin shortly after this post is published.</p>\n<p>Finally, in the event of a successful transfer of UniswapV3Factory ownership, the contracts will be the subject of a $1m bug bounty hosted by Immunefi.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"appendix-e-front-end-access-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#appendix-e-front-end-access-9\"></a>Appendix E: Front end access</h3>\n<p>The UF has funded two separate front ends to provide access to the UniStaker contract.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde Finance has built a <a href=\"https://github.com/avantgardefinance/UniStaking/tree/main/app\">React app</a> that enables the functionalities necessary for users to stake, delegate, and collect their fees. It is open source and its UI is purposefully unopinionated. It can be freely forked and the components copied at will for other front end teams to incorporate in their apps. This app will be deployed and hosted following a successful governance proposal; it can also be downloaded and run locally.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde has also built a <a href=\"https://github.com/avantgardefinance/UniStaking/tree/main/subgraph\">hosted subgraph</a> that indexes the events fired by the V3FactoryOwner and UniStaker contracts. This subgraph will be a valuable tool to anyone building an app that interacts with UniStaker or V3FactoryOwner.</p>\n<p>Both Avantgarde products are in the final stages of active development and testing; their repos are subject to change.</p>\n<p>Agora is integrating staking and delegation functionality into the app they maintain at <a href=\"http://vote.uniswapfoundation.org\">vote.uniswapfoundation.org</a>. Upon a successful governance vote, the new version of that app will be deployed.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"appendix-f-impact-on-protocol-liquidity-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#appendix-f-impact-on-protocol-liquidity-10\"></a>Appendix F: Impact on protocol liquidity</h3>\n<p>If this proposal passes, it sets the stage for future proposals to turn on the Uniswap Protocol fee. In evaluating any such future proposal, delegates should consider the potential impact to the procotol’s liquidity. To this end, the UF engaged Gauntlet to produce a report that investigates the likely outcomes. Using a simulation engine that ingests months of transaction-level blockchain data, Gauntlet’s report provides a framework to think about the impact on liquidity and trade execution resulting from the introduction of a protocol fee (and to measure the results of any successful implementation).</p>\n<p>An overview of their findings can be found <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gauntlet-s-uniswap-protocol-fee-report-tldr-version/22607\">here</a>, and a full discussion of their methodology can be found <a href=\"https://www.gauntlet.xyz/resources/uniswap-protocol-fee-report\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We encourage delegates to read through this work to inform their decision-making.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"appendix-g-next-steps-for-delegators-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#appendix-g-next-steps-for-delegators-11\"></a>Appendix G: Next steps for delegators</h3>\n<p>We expect an influx of new delegation, as well as adjustments to existing delegation, if this proposal passes. As such we want to share a few thoughts to help delegators.</p>\n<p>We expect all UNI token holders to do their diligence on delegates and delegate to those who have shown good judgment, decision making, and engagement with the protocol. You can review delegate platforms and past activity <a href=\"https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/\">here</a>. Your choice in delegate will directly impact the future of the protocol.</p>\n<p>Additionally, note that protocol fees will flow through the new staking and delegation contracts (not existing ones). In other words, if you delegate today or are already delegated today, you will have to re-delegate once the new contracts go live in order to receive your portion of protocol fees.</p>\n<p>Finally, note it will still be possible to delegate without staking by using the existing delegation function on the UNI token contract.</p>\n<p><em>The Uniswap Foundation supports a community of individuals and organizations dedicated to a more open, fair and decentralized financial system through education around and broader adoption of blockchain technologies and smart contract-based decentralized protocols.</em></p>\n<p><em>This post does not constitute, and is not intended to constitute, any kind of legal advice, and readers are not to construe the contents of this brief as legal, business, tax, accounting, investment, or other advice.

Despite the differences, they commonly emphasize delegate participation and communication. And in many cases, delegate compensation is factored by the voting power as well, thus the larger delegates often get a greater share of the delegate reward compared to smaller delegates.</p>\n<p>StableLab has experience designing Delegate and Governance reward initiatives across various ecosystems. In the case of Uniswap, our goal is to prioritize collective growth and accountability over typical competition. The Uniswap community and its governance consist of various esteemed and reputable contributors, fostering synergy through collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details</strong></p>\n<p>Participation and communication as Delegates requirements that are common across delegate compensation will be applied. However, similar to “Delegation of UNI to Active but Underrepresented Delegates”, rather than calculating the voting record since the start of delegate launch, it would be examining for the past 3 months (which also means the delegates should at least should have contributed for 3 months) to allow more participation. Generally, the reward is a linear scale where the better the performance such as participation rate, the more reward such delegates get. However, for simplicity and also to be more inclusive, the proposal will use 80% for the past 3 months as a benchmark for both participation and communication.</p>\n<p>Also generally, the reward is factored by the amount of token delegated. For certain protocols, one needs to be top 8 or 12 to be considered for delegate compensation. However, to be inclusive, we will implement a mixture where we borrow the idea of a badge system. 500,000 UNI or above delegated , of which 50+ delegates have such amount according to tally, have “Badges” and can apply for Delegate Reward if they also fulfill participation and communication requirement. For those delegates that have less than 500,000 UNI delegated can also apply for the “Badge” with endorsement from delegates with 500,000 UNI +. There’s no limit on how many these 500,000 UNI + delegates can endorse as this mechanism is in place to prevent spams but also give ample opportunity to all the genuine delegates.</p>\n<p>While there can be other factors to be considered such as need to author or co-author a proposal, we believe the above three requirements are good place to start for RFC.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/1/1af33c8912f17ca849be9c8fc8299198f569b888.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3QpxQF3jzGV1nMiAiTUEjkRwgUE.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1af33c8912f17ca849be9c8fc8299198f569b888_2_422x441.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"3QpxQF3jzGV1nMiAiTUEjkRwgUE\" width=\"422\" height=\"441\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1af33c8912f17ca849be9c8fc8299198f569b888_2_422x441.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1af33c8912f17ca849be9c8fc8299198f569b888_2_633x661.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/1/1af33c8912f17ca849be9c8fc8299198f569b888_2_844x882.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDF1F1\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Example from MakerDAO- Pre-Endgame</em><p></p>\n<p><strong>More Details - Communication Metric</strong></p>\n<p>Communication means an interested delegate will need to create a delegate profile post, make an introduction and also post voting updates that require reasonings behind their votings.

Recognizing the vibrant Uniswap community, we propose a canonical deployment of Uniswap v3 on Zora benefitting creators, collectors, and builders of both ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Zora Network is onboarding thousands of creators and collectors to Ethereum L2s through a distinctly creative brand and support from protocols like Mint.Fun, Holograph, PartyDAO, and the Zora Creator Toolkit. It is important for Zora Network’s ecosystem of creators, collectors, and developers to have access to premier crypto tooling, including DeFi protocols, that can help them protect and expand the value they are creating onchain.</p>\n<p>We believe offering these tools is a material step in supporting creators as they explore and innovate with onchain media. This is particularly true as the amount of people and teams that earn ETH on Zora Network continues to grow from features like Zora’s Protocol Rewards.</p>\n<p>This momentous collaboration will position Uniswap to win long term market share on an emergent L2 network with a uniquely differentiated user base. And, it will signal the DAO’s ongoing support of the growing population of creators, collectors, and builders that transact on Zora Network everyday.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"background-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#background-4\"></a>Background</h1>\n<p>Zora Network is an L2 built on top of Ethereum using the OP stack <a href=\"https://dune.com/sealaunch/zora-network\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">with over half a million addresses onchain</a> and just under 1000 ETH in transaction fees. Zora Network launched last summer on June 21st, the Summer Solstice. It is currently supported by industry leading infrastructure partners such as Rainbow, Opensea, Zerion, Dune, Layer Zero and many more. Zora Network supports a bustling ecosystem of creators, collectors and developers that are exploring creativity onchain. Next is a quick overview of the Zora Network ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"creator-and-collector-ecosystem-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#creator-and-collector-ecosystem-5\"></a>Creator and Collector Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>Zora Network brings a uniquely creative and NFT native audience to the Uniswap ecosystem. Many of the active users on Zora Network are the artists, collectors, and builders that makeup the onchain creative community. Zora Network makes up <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3216404/5377012\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">30-34% of mint marketshare </a>across Ethereum and its L2s ecosystem. In the last month, there were more than 40,000 NFT contracts created on Zora Network, and today <a href=\"https://dune.com/jhackworth/zora-network\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">36% of all unique collectors </a>across Ethereum and its L2 ecosystem are active on Zora Network.</p>\n<p>Adoption of Zora Network comes alongside easy to use product features in the Zora Creator Toolkit like email signup and free creation, which position Zora to easily onboard first time users to crypto. As these users grow in their understanding of crypto, it’s important that Zora Network has brand aligned partners, like Uniswap, available to facilitate our users’ next steps in their crypto journey.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"developer-ecosystem-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#developer-ecosystem-6\"></a>Developer Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>The Zora Network developer ecosystem includes a lot of the core infrastructure that developer teams need to get started with a new project in crypto. There are <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3102645/5177911\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">over 10,000 contracts deployed to Zora Network everyday</a>. Examples of teams that support Zora Network today include infrastructure teams like Dune, Third Web, Tenderly, and Gelato as well key developer tools like Wagmi and Privy.</p>\n<p>NFT native protocols like those mentioned above, Mint.Fun, Holograph, and Highlight, have also integrated Zora Network alongside others like <a href=\"https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x5921a344e85553d8ec7f8510917d38aaa8d21081\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gallery</a> and <a href=\"https://fair.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Fair XYZ</a>. One of the more exciting integrations of late has been the <a href=\"https://warpcast.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Warpcast</a> team’s launch of in-app minting of Zora Network NFTs powered by Warps. Lastly on the developer front — Protocol Rewards on Zora Network, specifically referral rewards, are proving to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylemccollom/status/1697237856962720076\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a new revenue stream</a> for developers building aggregators, recommendation systems like <a href=\"https://www.daylight.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Daylight</a>, and mobile notification rails like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/interfacedapp\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Interface</a>. Zora Network is still early, but it’s proving to be valuable for developer teams of all types.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-for-uniswap-on-zora-network-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#rationale-for-uniswap-on-zora-network-7\"></a>Rationale for Uniswap on Zora Network</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8192123-understanding-protocol-rewards-on-zora\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Protocol Rewards on Zora Network</a> makes the need for stablecoins and fiat on/off-ramps increasingly apparent. Creators, collectors, and developers in the Zora ecosystem are <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3216223/5376687\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">earning six figures of ETH in protocol rewards everyday</a>. For some creators, protocol rewards are helping to <a href=\"https://warpcast.com/tokenart.eth/0xfb0ded63\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">pay their rent </a>or just grab a slice of pizza. And for platforms, rewards are quickly becoming a core part of their business model and a key to their success.</p>\n<p>There is a growing need on Zora Network for swaps and stablecoins that can better protect the value these individuals and teams create. Today, creators are required to bridge their ETH from Zora Network to a chain where Uniswap is supported, which costs gas and eats into their earnings. Only then will they be able to swap to a stablecoin.

Of which, each strongly benefited from early mover advantages. Today, there are 13 deployments of Uniswap v3. Many of the new deployments are newer chains that, while today, don’t have the usage seen on Arbitrum, Polygon, or Optimism; one or multiple of them will likely grow to be as big or bigger.</p>\n<p>On each of these deployments, Uniswap is currently the underdog. We’re competing against Uniswap v3 &amp; v2 forks and other concentrated liquidity protocols, which often have more focused resources for marketing and distribution than Uniswap and often boast close relationships with the chain’s team.</p>\n<p>The good news is these chains are still generally nascent. So, if Uniswap acts quickly, it can take the lead spot and likely hold it thereafter, thanks to its robust ecosystem of tooling and support.</p>\n<p>What would a good plan of action include?</p>\n<p><strong>We develop a Uniswap v3 onboarding package!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>$250k in allotted UNI to dedicate to kicking off the liquidity incentivization on the chain for 3 months (with frontloaded rewards) and 4-5 key pools to incentivize.\n<ul>\n<li>Classic pairs like ETH-USDC, WBTC-USDC, USDC-USDT, and one local pool.</li>\n<li>An APY of 10% and $250k allocated across three months would incentivize $10M in liquidity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A partner protocol/app to execute the UNI rewards program live from day one.\n<ul>\n<li>Let’s bring back the Uniswap v3 staker or pick a partner to handle the allocated rewards.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A Uniswap v3 frontend live from day one.\n<ul>\n<li>Oku is already leading this effort for zkSync, Scroll, Rootstock, Boba, Moonbeam, and soon Polygon zkEVM.\n<ul>\n<li>For Oku to support a new chain, it’s $45k for the initial integration and $5k/month for 12 months. This covers getting the new chain onto the frontend, the Oku API (free), our cloud costs for hosting the API, our global system for quoting, node requests, and DevOps maintenance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once governance decides on a standard package, when a new chain wants a deployment, we can include this package approval and roll-out as part of the governance proposal. This also ends the current status of rubber-stamping deployment proposals and provides a reason for new chains to seek the support of Uniswap governance proactively. Also, delegates can vote on which existing deployments should receive an onboarding package.</p>\n<p>Uniswap could quickly take the lead on 5-10 chains without spending more than $2.5m. If one of these chains grows into a major player (like Arb/Op/Poly), it will have paid for the entire program multiple times over (assuming the fee switch is someday turned). Providing a modest onboarding package helps Uniswap diversify and develop new markets without waiting to see which chains become long-term relevant - at which point it is often too late or too costly to get market share.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I’m posting this as a discussion topic.

However, this would reduce LP yield, leading to decreased liquidity, higher slippage for traders, and a potential loss of trading volume to competitors.</p>\n<p>The Uniswap Foundation has engaged Gauntlet to model the effects of a protocol-level fee on revenue, liquidity, and trading volume for certain deployments of the Uniswap protocol. This report investigates the effects on Uniswap v3 specifically, and may serve as a reference for delegates when they consider potential future votes to implement a protocol fee.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"methodology-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#methodology-2\"></a>Methodology</h1>\n<p>Using a data set comprised of all swap transactions on the Ethereum mainnet deployments of Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, and Sushi between August 2023 and January 2024, Gauntlet has built a simulation engine that can predict how a protocol fee would impact the liquidity and slippage of Uniswap pools. Based on those changes, the engine predicts how swap transactions would be impacted for two different types of orderflow: core and MEV. Core volume represents retail and institutional traders and is assumed to migrate to exchanges offering the lowest slippage. MEV volume primarily consists of toxic arbitrage trades, and is assumed to decrease in line with liquidity. The simulation also considers the potential exacerbation of the negative flywheel effect of reduced LP revenue from trading volume causing further reductions in liquidity.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"results-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#results-3\"></a>Results</h1>\n<p>Using the above methodology, Gauntlet considered the impact on core volume, MEV volume, and protocol revenue across hypothetical protocol fees from 1% to 99% for pools that Uniswap Labs charges an interface fee (<a href=\"https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/20131678274957-What-are-Uniswap-Labs-fees\">those that trade between stablecoins, ETH, and WBTC</a>). While Uniswap V3 only supports protocol fees ranging from 10-25%, projections from outside of that range may be useful for designing future versions of the Uniswap protocol. The revenues are based on Uniswap’s usage from August 2023 to October 2024 and should be seen as ballpark numbers. Actual revenues could be substantially higher or lower depending on macro factors such as overall DEX trading volumes and crypto market prices.</p>\n<p>As observed, the impact on volume, TVL, and revenue depends significantly on the fee applied. In the most conservative case allowed by the v3 fee contracts, Gauntlet predicts that a flat 10% protocol fee would lead to a loss of 4.25-14.78% in liquidity, a 4.25-14.78% reduction in MEV volume, and a 0.22-1.44% decrease in core trading volume when factoring in the flywheel effect. Combining the loss in MEV volume and Core volume would result in a total volume loss of 1.93-10.87% for Uniswap with 93-96% of that lost volume coming from a reduction in toxic MEV volume.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/d699180657225f3b7a89060d17ac4d2d737d2a19.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uCqbcJ1wYWza3vFYTp7WngX3vOF.png?dl=1\" title=\"core_loss\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d699180657225f3b7a89060d17ac4d2d737d2a19_2_666x500.png\" alt=\"core_loss\" data-base62-sha1=\"uCqbcJ1wYWza3vFYTp7WngX3vOF\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d699180657225f3b7a89060d17ac4d2d737d2a19_2_666x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d699180657225f3b7a89060d17ac4d2d737d2a19_2_999x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/d699180657225f3b7a89060d17ac4d2d737d2a19.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"232132\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/7fd9e1976a4cabf4edd5ae43928ee663cf404a13.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/if1rIEE8EWvO3rKXGomKBa8nyw3.png?dl=1\" title=\"mev_loss\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/7fd9e1976a4cabf4edd5ae43928ee663cf404a13_2_666x500.png\" alt=\"mev_loss\" data-base62-sha1=\"if1rIEE8EWvO3rKXGomKBa8nyw3\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/7fd9e1976a4cabf4edd5ae43928ee663cf404a13_2_666x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/7/7fd9e1976a4cabf4edd5ae43928ee663cf404a13_2_999x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/7fd9e1976a4cabf4edd5ae43928ee663cf404a13.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"232132\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>From a revenue perspective, if this 10% fee is only applied to the pools for which Uniswap Labs charges an interface fee, Uniswap would earn $10.3-10.8M annually based on market conditions over the time period analyzed or $40m annually based on the peak market volume observed in December 2021.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/f/f058c68cb689ffeaba9b2d2be4627183beb3d2bc.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/yicNd3QkZI62M2UmpdozvD82A1u.png?dl=1\" title=\"revenue_base\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/f058c68cb689ffeaba9b2d2be4627183beb3d2bc_2_666x500.png\" alt=\"revenue_base\" data-base62-sha1=\"yicNd3QkZI62M2UmpdozvD82A1u\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/f058c68cb689ffeaba9b2d2be4627183beb3d2bc_2_666x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/f058c68cb689ffeaba9b2d2be4627183beb3d2bc_2_999x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/f/f058c68cb689ffeaba9b2d2be4627183beb3d2bc.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"232132\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>It’s important to note that the impact on revenue and trading volume varies across different pools, and further work will be required to dynamically set fees to maximize efficiency.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"recommendations-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#recommendations-4\"></a>Recommendations</h1>\n<p>If the Uniswap governance community were to consider implementing protocol fees, Gauntlet recommends an incremental approach to rolling them out. This should begin with a low fee on select pools, followed by an extension to additional pools and a gradual increase in the fee on existing ones, in order to validate the projections presented in our report. Under current market conditions and during an upswing, a conservative fee on carefully selected pools would generate a significant amount of revenue with a limited impact on non-MEV volume.</p>\n<p>The community choice of whether or not to institute a protocol fee comes down to whether or not the long-term revenue gained outweighs the losses in volume and liquidity.</p>\n<p>Our analysis shows that the losses to TVL and toxic MEV volume may be significant with even a conservative fee switch. Still, we expect the impact on core, non-MEV volume to be very minor under all but the most extreme fees. The only means to identify if a fee switch is an optimal strategy for the Uniswap DAO and protocol community is to perform calculated experiments with a live fee switch, which Gauntlet is keen to help craft.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gauntlet-s-uniswap-protocol-fee-report-tldr-version/22607\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gauntlet-s-uniswap-protocol-fee-report-tldr-version/22607","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Jan 2024 19:57:43 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-22607"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gauntlet-s-uniswap-protocol-fee-report-tldr-version/22607.rss","#text":"Gauntlet’s Uniswap Protocol Fee Report - TLDR version"},"filter":false}]}}}
