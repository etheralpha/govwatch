Recently, it has come to light in private communications that some DAO delegates and participants may have been subpoenaed in connection with their activities within the DAO, some in highly alarming and threatening situations.</p>\n<p>To support and protect Uniswap DAO participants from the growing legal risks associated with their involvement, we propose setting aside $10 million in a dedicated Operator Legal Defense Fund. This fund will be used exclusively to cover legal expenses incurred by participating delegates in responding to subpoenas related to their participation in the Uniswap DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong><br>\nThe regulatory environment around decentralized finance (DeFi) and DAOs remains uncertain and rapidly evolving. As a result, Uniswap DAO participants are increasingly vulnerable to legal actions initiated by governmental and regulatory bodies. Without the appropriate financial support, individual delegates may face overwhelming legal costs simply for their role in representing the DAO and participating in governance.</p>\n<p>Given the significant legal risks faced by Uniswap DAO members, it is crucial for Uniswap to establish a similar legal support mechanism.</p>\n<p>By allocating $10 million to this Legal Defense Fund, we are creating a safeguard for our delegates and participants, ensuring they have access to proper legal representation and the resources needed to respond to subpoenas.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal Details</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fund Allocation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The DAO will allocate $10 million to establish a Legal Defense Fund. This fund will be reserved solely for covering legal and operational expenses related to subpoena responses for Uniswap DAO participants.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To qualify for reimbursement from the Legal Defense Fund, a participant must:\n<ul>\n<li>Be an active Uniswap DAO delegate at the time the subpoena was issued. (TBD: this could be made broader, for example some people might not be participating because of legal risk)</li>\n<li>Provide verifiable proof of the subpoena related to their role within the DAO.</li>\n<li>Submit legitimate legal bills associated with their defense or response to the subpoena.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>KYC Requirement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given the sensitive nature of distributing funds for legal purposes, KYC (Know Your Customer) verification will be required before any payouts are made. This ensures accountability and prevents misuse of funds while maintaining the security and integrity of the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fund Disbursement Process</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eligible delegates will submit a formal reimbursement request, including evidence of their legal expenses and proof of the subpoena.</li>\n<li>Each case will be reviewed by an independent team, which will verify the documentation before authorizing the release of funds.</li>\n<li>To ensure fairness and transparency, a detailed process for submitting and reviewing claims will be implemented.</li>\n<li>TBD: Unclear what sort of privacy requirements need to be implemented at this point.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Governance and Oversight</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A designated committee, consisting of community members and legal experts, will oversee the management of the Delegate Legal Defense Fund. This committee will be responsible for reviewing and approving disbursement requests and ensuring that the funds are used appropriately.</li>\n<li>(TBD: I am not personally a fan of creating committees willy-nilly, so I’d like to leave this point as something to be determined if this proposal gains traction)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fund Administration</strong> (TBD)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The administration of the Legal Defense Fund will be determined in collaboration with the Uniswap community and stakeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Options under consideration</strong> include having the Uniswap Foundation manage the fund directly, given its role in overseeing the broader mission and operations of the DAO. However, due to potential legal and jurisdictional complexities, it may be more appropriate to create a <strong>separate legal entity</strong> specifically dedicated to managing the fund.</li>\n<li>This entity would be responsible for the following tasks:\n<ul>\n<li>Managing and disbursing the funds in accordance with the guidelines set by the DAO.</li>\n<li>Conducting KYC and verifying the eligibility of applicants.</li>\n<li>Working with external legal advisors to review claims and ensure proper fund usage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The exact structure, governance, and operational details of the fund administration are left as <strong>TBD</strong> at this time. This will be fleshed out through a community discussion and agreed upon prior to moving toward an on-chain vote. Careful attention will be paid to compliance with legal standards while ensuring that the fund operates efficiently and in alignment with the decentralized nature of the Uniswap DAO.</p>\n<p>The goal of this proposal is not to create extended processes and entities but rather a streamlined process for ensuring that Delegates have appropriate legal coverage for their participation in governance.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>\nThe success of the Uniswap DAO is built on the contributions of its participants and delegates, who have taken on significant responsibilities and risks in shaping the future of decentralized finance. By establishing this Legal Defense Fund, the DAO will demonstrate its commitment to protecting its members from legal threats and ensuring they have the necessary resources to navigate these challenges.</p>\n<p>In an uncertain regulatory landscape, it is critical that we take proactive steps to safeguard the rights and well-being of our community members. This fund will not only provide financial protection but also ensure that the DAO continues to operate with the full confidence of its delegates and participants.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-establish-a-legal-fund-to-pay-for-delegate-legal-fees/24605\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-establish-a-legal-fund-to-pay-for-delegate-legal-fees/24605","pubDate":"Sat, 21 Sep 2024 13:57:33 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24605"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-establish-a-legal-fund-to-pay-for-delegate-legal-fees/24605.rss","#text":"[RFC] Establish a Legal fund to pay for Delegate Legal Fees"},"filter":false},{"title":"About the Request For Comment category","dc:creator":"eek637","category":"Request For Comment","description":"<p>(Replace this first paragraph with a brief description of your new category.

Nouns DAO encountered an incident when investor DCF GOD and allies amassed enough NFTs to propose liquidating the treasury. Amidst a bear market and disagreements over spending priorities, they used the governance structure for personal gain, withdrawing $27 million from the treasury.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Aragon DAO experienced a governance exploit in May 2023. Investors gained control of 51% of the token supply and proposed liquidating the treasury. Despite efforts to oppose the move, they extracted $163 million, which led to Aragon’s dissolution.</p>\n<p>Most recently, in 2024, Compound DAO suffered a governance attack by a group known as the “Golden Boys.” They exploited the governance process to pass a proposal transferring $24 million in COMP tokens to a protocol under their control. This attack succeeded due to several factors: low voter turnout, poor timing of the vote (during a weekend), and lack of transparency.</p>\n<p>These cases highlight a critical vulnerability in DAOs—concentrated voting power and low voter engagement can lead to malicious actors seizing governance control and draining the treasury for personal gain.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-54114-rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54114-rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Uniswap DAO’s core mission is to govern its protocol and manage treasury resources to support its long-term objectives. However, as the DAO grows, its treasury expands, creating an attractive target for potential attacks.</p>\n<p>The current dynamic poses a threat: while the value of the treasury increases, the percentage of tokens actively delegated for governance decreases. This creates an imbalance where an attacker could acquire enough $UNI to take control of the DAO at a cost far below the total value of the treasury. Without safeguards, Uniswap DAO is at risk of facing a similar governance attack.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-54114-implementation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54114-implementation-4\"></a>Implementation</h1>\n<p>We see two possible solutions to address this challenge:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Establish a Veto Council</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One proposed solution to safeguard the DAO’s treasury is to create a Veto Council. This council would have the authority to veto any proposal deemed harmful to the DAO. However, to avoid centralisation risks, the council’s veto power would be limited—lasting only 18 months. This ensures the council’s role is temporary, allowing time to strengthen governance while minimising the risk of long-term centralisation.</p>\n<p>The Veto Council would provide an immediate defence mechanism, intervening when malicious proposals threaten the DAO’s stability or treasury. The ENS DAO recently adopted a similar solution (<a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/42329103797433777309488042029679811802172320979541414683300183273376839219133\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a>).</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Introduce Proposal Staking</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An alternative solution is to implement a staking requirement for proposal authors. Under this system, anyone submitting a proposal must stake a small amount of UNI tokens, which would be locked until the vote concluded. Additionally, the vote would include a default option to cancel the proposal and slash the author if it receives over 33% of the votes to veto the proposal. This would effectively discourage bad actors from submitting harmful proposals, as they risk losing their staked tokens. The Cosmos hub governance has successfully implemented the ‘’No with Veto’’ option to combat spam and malicious proposals and has achieved tremendous success. This approach, however, can only be implemented in matured DAOs in terms of governance processes as an irrational stakeholder(s) with 33% of the voting power could exploit the system and veto any proposal and slash an innocent participant.</p>\n<p>Benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Unlike the Veto Council, which introduces some level of centralisation, proposal staking preserves the DAO’s decentralised nature. It empowers the broader delegate community to assess and vote on the validity of proposals, ensuring the process remains transparent and democratic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By adding financial risk to submitting proposals, the staking mechanism discourages malicious intent while encouraging more thoughtful, well-constructed proposals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No with Veto could be used by minor delegates to convey their strong disagreement with a particular proposal.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-54114-next-steps-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54114-next-steps-5\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Gather consensus from the DAO about next steps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Voting Options</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish a Veto council</li>\n<li>Explore Proposal staking</li>\n<li>Make no changes</li>\n<li>Other</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>10 posts - 9 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-preparing-for-possible-governance-attacks/24592\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-preparing-for-possible-governance-attacks/24592","pubDate":"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 09:40:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24592"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-preparing-for-possible-governance-attacks/24592.rss","#text":"[RFC] Preparing for possible Governance Attacks"},"filter":false},{"title":"Avantgarde Finance Delegate Platform","dc:creator":"Avantgarde","category":"Delegation Pitch","description":"<p><strong>Delegate Address:</strong> avantgardefi.eth (0xb49f8b8613be240213c1827e2e576044ffec7948)<br>\n<strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:governance@avantgarde.finance\">governance@avantgarde.finance</a><br>\n<strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://avantgarde.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://avantgarde.finance/<br>\n</a><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/avantgardefi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://x.com/avantgardefi<br>\n</a><strong>Governance Lead:</strong> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/justerik\">@justErik</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-54110-about-us-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54110-about-us-1\"></a>About us</h2>\n<p>Avantgarde is a crypto native asset management, advisory and research firm, specialising in asset liability management, R&amp;D, special situations, risk monitoring and on-chain diversification strategies.

Should this standard gain widespread adoption, it could fundamentally alter the dynamics of DEXs, with Uniswap—the DEX with the largest TVL—standing at the epicenter of this seismic shift.</p>\n<p>Although studies suggest that our first hypothesis is correct and that the main reason a user refrains from taking action (in this case, bridging and adding liquidity) is due to think time, our findings indicate that the other hypotheses are incorrect. Consequently, the rise of intent-based protocols shows a positive correlation with on-chain liquidity, potentially enhancing it rather than diminishing it. This correlation is stronger on Ethereum than Arbitrum or Base, although the effect varies depending on the asset pairs analyzed.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-54097-introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Liquidity remains a critical challenge for many emerging blockchain networks, particularly within DEXs. Despite accumulating significant TVL, these networks often struggle to maintain sufficient liquidity, leading to poor UX, high transaction costs, and ultimately, hampered growth and adoption. This issue is exacerbated by the complexities and costs associated with bridging assets across chains and low APYs that fail to incentivize liquidity providers.</p>\n<p>This study explores how Uniswap can play a pivotal role in mitigating these challenges by leveraging atomic cross-chain swaps. These swaps enable seamless asset exchanges across different blockchains without relying on a central intermediary, potentially reducing friction and unlocking new liquidity pools.</p>\n<p>Our research will focus on three key hypotheses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Transaction costs and bridging complexities deter liquidity provision on new blockchains.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Intent-based atomic cross-chain swaps could reduce liquidity on smaller DEXs.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>These swaps may impact the on-chain liquidity of high-cap assets more than long-tail assets.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>By investigating these aspects, we aim to provide actionable insights and recommendations to enhance liquidity provision in new blockchain networks supported by Uniswap’s innovative technology and established platform.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-54097-liquidity-flywheel-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-liquidity-flywheel-3\"></a>Liquidity Flywheel</h1>\n<p>Our research builds on the concept of the <strong>liquidity flywheel</strong>, which is the essence of every AMM-based DEX and the main incentive why liquidity providers add liquidity. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>High Liquidity Attracts Traders:</strong> The more liquidity there is, the easier and faster it is for traders to execute large transactions without significantly affecting the price.</li>\n<li><strong>Trading Volume Generates Fees:</strong> Every trade is charged a fee, which is collected and distributed to the LPs (Liquidity Providers) who have supplied liquidity.</li>\n<li><strong>Fees Attract Liquidity Providers:</strong> Because liquidity providers earn these trading fees, providing liquidity becomes an attractive way to earn passive income. The more fees generated from trading volume, the more people are incentivized to add liquidity to earn those fees.</li>\n<li><strong>More Liquidity Attracts More Traders:</strong> The pools grow larger as more people add liquidity. Larger pools mean even better trading conditions for traders, attracting more traders to Uniswap, increasing trading volume, generating more fees, and thus continuing the cycle.</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/5/56e5202637a7d3e97c20b08a4a80aa2e384981cb.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/coHXCZvrAyNfoU4NQK0LVI3xblx.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56e5202637a7d3e97c20b08a4a80aa2e384981cb_2_690x387.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"coHXCZvrAyNfoU4NQK0LVI3xblx\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56e5202637a7d3e97c20b08a4a80aa2e384981cb_2_690x387.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56e5202637a7d3e97c20b08a4a80aa2e384981cb_2_1035x580.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56e5202637a7d3e97c20b08a4a80aa2e384981cb_2_1380x774.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"030303\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>One strategy new blockchains use to attract liquidity is to increase incentives for liquidity providers through airdrops or tokens, ensuring that the APY they receive for providing liquidity is higher than what other blockchains offer. This is how they attempt to kickstart the liquidity flywheel.</p>\n<p>However, these incentives often fall short of starting this flywheel due to two main reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Friction (speed, cost, security, etc.) from bridging assets and making the necessary swaps to add liquidity.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The security of these new blockchains, which is inferior to the base layer (Ethereum), leads most LPs to prefer staying on Ethereum despite receiving lower APYs.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Cross-chain intent-based protocols address friction by allowing users to bridge and swap assets quickly and securely.</p>\n<p>Yet, while solving one problem, they could potentially create another: If the fees generated in an AMM are distributed to solvers instead of liquidity providers, could this impact the liquidity flywheel and, consequently, be detrimental to the liquidity of AMM DEXs like Uniswap?</p>\n<p>While it is true that solvers need to get their liquidity somewhere, they typically have access to significant funds and can obtain liquidity from CEXs at a lower cost and with greater ease than on-chain. As a result, they may not generate fees for LPs in these situations. However, this dynamic changes when dealing with long-tail assets that are only available on-chain or listed on a limited number of CEXs with low liquidity. In such cases, market makers would need to acquire these assets on-chain, thereby generating fees for LPs.</p>\n<p>We’ve analyzed with empirical data what is happening and if our hypotheses are correct.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-54097-analysis-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-analysis-4\"></a>Analysis</h1>\n<p>To test our hypotheses, we analyzed the on-chain volume and the volume of intent-based protocols (not just the cross-chain ones, but every relevant intent-based protocol) for three different asset pairs across three blockchains. The objective was to verify whether an increase in the volume of intent-based protocols correlates with a decrease in on-chain volume for the same asset pairs. This decrease would lead to a decrease in the on-chain liquidity because it could break the liquidity flywheel.</p>\n<p>Although it could make sense to analyze all the off-chain volume (all transactions conducted off-chain, including those on CEX and intent-based protocols), in this study, we focus exclusively on the volume from intent-based protocols because it reflects transactions only from on-chain users (those who use a DEX, whether intent-based or not) and not from off-chain users (those who only use CEX).</p>\n<p>Our analysis was conducted systematically involving four key steps, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the blockchain and asset pairs in question.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54097-step-1-blockchain-selection-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-step-1-blockchain-selection-5\"></a>Step 1: Blockchain Selection</h3>\n<p>The first step involved identifying the most suitable blockchains for our case study. This was achieved through the following process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: We gathered inflow-outflow data from deBridge (one of the most relevant cross-chain intent-based protocols), focusing on a cumulative 180-day period.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: We compiled a list of the top blockchains by cumulative inflow-outflow volume, to identify blockchains with significant intent-based cross-chain activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Criteria Matching</strong>: We further refined the selection by ensuring that the chosen blockchain met specific criteria:\n<ul>\n<li>Adequate (i.e. among the top 10 volume blockchains) cumulative 180-day off-chain volume.</li>\n<li>The absence of an ongoing airdrop could skew the data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Selection</strong>: We chose 3 different blockchains based on the three steps above:\n<ul>\n<li>Base Layer: Ethereum</li>\n<li>Consolidated Alt-layer: Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Alt-layer + new chain: Base</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54097-step-2-off-chain-and-on-chain-data-collection-180-day-period-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-step-2-off-chain-and-on-chain-data-collection-180-day-period-6\"></a>Step 2: Off-chain and On-chain Data Collection (180-day Period)</h3>\n<p>After defining the sample, the next step focused on collecting and analyzing off-chain and on-chain data, ensuring that we had a detailed understanding of the asset pairs and their volumes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Off-chain Data Extraction</strong>: We obtained the cumulative volumes generated on intent-based protocols for all exchanged asset pairs (e.g., ETH-USDT, ETH-USDC) on the selected blockchains over 180 days.</li>\n<li><strong>On-chain Data Extraction</strong>: We obtained the cumulative volumes generated on DEXs for all exchanged asset pairs (e.g., ETH-USDT, ETH-USDC) on the selected blockchains over 180 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Asset Pair Identification</strong>: We chose 3 pairs of assets for each blockchain: the main pair of assets (ETH-USDC or similar), a pair of assets including a high cap with high volume (e.g. PEPE-ETH), and a pair of assets of an on-chain-only token (or at least predominantly on-chain) (e.g. USDC-USD+)</li>\n<li><strong>Selection</strong>: We chose 3 different pairs of assets for each blockchain:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereum</strong>: USDC-ETH, PEPE-ETH, APU-ETH</li>\n<li><strong>Arbitrum</strong>: USDC-ETH, ARB-ETH, MIM-ETH</li>\n<li><strong>Base</strong>: USDC-ETH, BRETT-ETH, USD±USDC</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54097-step-3-market-activity-data-collection-180-day-period-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-step-3-market-activity-data-collection-180-day-period-7\"></a>Step 3: Market Activity Data Collection (180-day period)</h3>\n<p>The final step related to data extraction focused on retrieving network activity data to use as a proxy in our analysis.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Network Activity Data Collection</strong>: We extracted the daily transaction count for each of the selected blockchains.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Utilization</strong>: This data was then used as a proxy indicator to better understand and analyze the network activity in relation to the other variables in our study.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54097-step-4-data-analysis-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-step-4-data-analysis-8\"></a>Step 4: Data Analysis</h3>\n<p>In this phase, we looked over the collected data using statistical and graphical methods. The primary objective was to determine whether there was a correlation between the increase in off-chain volume and the decrease in on-chain volume for each asset pair.</p>\n<p>The analysis involved the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Logarithmic transformations were applied to the on-chain volume, off-chain volume, and active addresses data to address skewness and stabilize variance.</li>\n<li><strong>Regression Models:</strong> Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models were employed to analyze the relationship between on-chain volume (dependent variable) and two independent variables: off-chain volume and active addresses. The models were separately applied to each token pair on each blockchain.</li>\n<li><strong>Statistical Significance:</strong> The significance of off-chain volume’s effect on on-chain volume was determined using p-values, with a threshold of p &lt; 0.05 to indicate statistical significance.</li>\n<li><strong>Pearson Correlation Coefficient:</strong> Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the strength of the linear relationship between on-chain and off-chain volumes.</li>\n<li><strong>Visualizations:</strong> Regression plots were generated to visually represent the relationship between on-chain and off-chain volumes, including the Pearson correlation coefficient.</li>\n<li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> Analyzed the relationships between on-chain volume, off-chain volume, and active addresses over time.</li>\n<li><strong>ADF Test:</strong> Applied the ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test to ensure the stationarity of the time series data.</li>\n<li><strong>VAR Model:</strong> Utilized a VAR (Vector AutoRegression) model to explore the interdependencies among the variables.</li>\n<li><strong>Granger Causality:</strong> Conducted Granger causality tests (normal and inverse) to assess whether off-chain volume can predict on-chain volume and whether on-chain volume can predict off-chain volume, indicating potential causality.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approach tested the <strong>hypothesis</strong> that an increase in off-chain volume was statistically associated with a decrease in on-chain volume for the selected asset pairs and either confirmed or refuted it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we analyzed the solvers’ activity and compared their volume to the on-chain volume to assess whether intent-based protocols are a practical alternative solution to AMM-based DEXs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-54097-results-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-results-9\"></a>Results</h1>\n<p>The numerical results

This suggests that an increase in off-chain trading volume is associated with a notable increase in on-chain volume. VAR model results indicate a strong predictive relationship from off-chain to on-chain volume, with Granger causality tests confirming this bidirectional influence. This pair’s high liquidity across CEX and DEX platforms underscores the robustness of this relationship, suggesting that off-chain activity might drive or reflect similar trends in on-chain transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>PEPE-WETH and APU-WETH</strong>: Both pairs exhibit strong positive correlations, with coefficients of 0.828 and 0.756, respectively, and very low p-values. The VAR analysis for these pairs also indicates a significant influence of off-chain volume on on-chain activity, particularly for PEPE-WETH, where Granger causality tests suggest that off-chain volume significantly predicts on-chain volume. These findings imply that even for less prominent pairs, off-chain volume is a strong predictor of on-chain activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54097-base-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-base-12\"></a><strong>Base</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>USDC-WETH</strong>:  The positive but smaller coefficient (0.186, p-value &lt; 0.001) suggests a weaker yet significant relationship between off-chain and on-chain volumes. VAR analysis for this pair shows that while there is a positive correlation, the predictive power is weaker compared to Ethereum. The differences might stem from variations in market maturity, liquidity, or infrastructure. Granger causality tests did not find a strong causal relationship, indicating that the interaction between these volumes might be more complex on Base.</li>\n<li><strong>USD±USDC</strong>: This pair shows an insignificant and slightly negative relationship between off-chain and on-chain volumes (coefficient = -0.011, p-value = 0.433). The results suggest that for USD±USDC, off-chain activity may not be a reliable predictor of on-chain volume and vice versa.</li>\n<li><strong>BRETT-WETH</strong>: Although less traded than USDC-WETH, BRETT-WETH still shows a positive correlation (coefficient = 0.152, p-value &lt; 0.001). The VAR analysis suggests that off-chain volumes can moderately predict on-chain activity even for smaller pairs on Base, although the relationship is not as robust as in more liquid pairs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54097-arbitrum-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-arbitrum-13\"></a><strong>Arbitrum</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>USDC-WETH</strong>: The relationship between off-chain and on-chain volumes is moderate but significant (coefficient = 0.404, p-value &lt; 0.001). However, the ADF tests indicate that the time series for on-chain volume, off-chain volume, and active addresses are not stationary, which raises concerns about the validity of the VAR model and Granger causality tests applied in this context. Although the VAR model suggests that off-chain volume influences on-chain volume, this relationship may be less robust due to the non-stationarity of the data. The Granger causality tests confirm some degree of influence, highlighting the interconnectedness of off-chain and on-chain activities even in less mature ecosystems like Arbitrum. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, given the potential for spurious relationships caused by the underlying trends in the non-stationary data. Further preprocessing or alternative modeling approaches may be necessary to obtain more reliable insights.</li>\n<li><strong>ARB-WETH</strong>: The effect is weaker (coefficient = 0.173, p-value &lt; 0.001) but still significant, indicating that off-chain activity influences on-chain volume, though the impact is smaller compared to more liquid pairs. The VAR analysis also supports this finding, showing a moderate influence of off-chain volume on on-chain activity.</li>\n<li><strong>MIM-WETH</strong>: This pair shows the weakest relationship (coefficient = 0.022, p-value = 0.337), with the VAR model and Granger causality tests indicating a lack of significant interaction between off-chain and on-chain volumes. The results suggest that for MIM-WETH, off-chain activity may not be a reliable predictor of on-chain volume and vice versa.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54097-comparative-insights-across-blockchains-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-comparative-insights-across-blockchains-14\"></a><strong>Comparative Insights Across Blockchains</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ethereum as a Benchmark</strong>: Ethereum remains the blockchain where off-chain volume most strongly affects on-chain activity. The robustness of these relationships, particularly for USDC-WETH, makes Ethereum an essential benchmark for understanding the dynamics between off-chain and on-chain trading. These insights could inform strategies as other blockchains evolve and develop their market structures.</li>\n<li><strong>Divergence in Lower Liquidity Networks</strong>: The results from Base and Arbitrum highlight that the relationship between off-chain and on-chain volumes can vary significantly depending on each blockchain’s liquidity and trading environment. On these blockchains, off-chain activity’s influence on on-chain volumes is less pronounced, possibly due to differences in market infrastructure or liquidity provision strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although our initial hypotheses suggested that intent-based protocols might negatively impact on-chain liquidity, our findings indicate a positive correlation across most pairs and blockchains. A key reason could be that this off-chain volume (generated by solvers) remains very low—about 4.63% of on-chain volume—failing to reach the critical threshold needed to significantly affect APY in liquidity pools.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the strength of this relationship varies significantly. The effect is more pronounced in highly liquid pairs (such as USDC-WETH on Ethereum) and diminishes in pairs primarily traded on DEXs or with lower liquidity. This could suggest that solvers are not interested in filling orders from DEX-only tokens. Our main hypothesis suggests that this is because these tokens can’t be arbitraged through CEXs, making it difficult to offer better quotes than the price provided by an AMM LP. However, this is just a hypothesis and should be investigated further to obtain conclusive data.</p>\n<p>Regarding the time series of all the aggregated data, its analysis, supported by the ADF tests, confirms that most key variables are stationary, ensuring that the relationships observed are reliable and not driven by underlying trends.</p>\n<p>The VAR model analysis, considering the most significant lags (ranging from 1 to 10 across different pairs), reveals that past values of on-chain and off-chain volumes do indeed influence current volumes over time. However, the complexity and interaction within these markets are highly dependent on the specific asset pair and blockchain, with varying degrees of impact observed across different lags.</p>\n<p>Granger causality tests show a mixed picture of the relationships between off-chain and on-chain volumes. For some pairs, there is a strong bidirectional relationship, indicating that off-chain and on-chain activities are closely interlinked, each influencing the other. However, for other pairs, the relationship is weaker or even insignificant, suggesting that the dynamics between off-chain and on-chain activities can vary widely depending on the specific context.</p>\n<p>Regarding solver activity, although they fill less volume on weekends, a comparison with on-chain volume shows that they fill orders every day at every hour, indicating that intent-based protocols are currently a good alternative to AMM-based DEXs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-54097-conclusions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-conclusions-15\"></a>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>We formulated three hypotheses before conducting this research:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Transaction costs and bridging complexities deter liquidity provision on new blockchains.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>True:</strong> Studies suggest that trader behavior is predominantly influenced by “think time” (in this case, the time a user spends thinking about how to bridge funds), one of the most critical predictors of user satisfaction. In addition, the task completion rate and “click time” (or offset time) also play significant roles. Transaction costs and bridging complexities compel users to deliberate on the fastest, safest, and cheapest way to bridge funds for adding liquidity, leading to longer thinking times and decreased user satisfaction. This results in fewer users choosing to bridge funds to new blockchains.</p>\n<p>These are not the only factors driving this behavior; incentives and lower security on new blockchains are also relevant reasons users may avoid bridging funds and providing liquidity.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Intent-based atomic cross-chain swaps could reduce liquidity on smaller DEXs.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Partially False:</strong> The data analysis suggests that while intent-based atomic cross-chain swaps were hypothesized to reduce liquidity on smaller DEXs, this is not entirely the case. Instead, there is a positive correlation between off-chain and on-chain volumes, indicating that off-chain activity can enhance on-chain liquidity because of the liquidity flywheel (more volume leads to more fees, leading to more liquidity). This suggests that rather than diminishing liquidity on DEXs, the off-chain volume may complement and support on-chain trading activity across different assets and blockchains.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>These swaps may negatively impact the on-chain liquidity of high-cap assets more than that of long-tail assets.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Partially False:</strong> The data analysis shows that intent-based swaps do not negatively impact the on-chain liquidity of high-cap assets as hypothesized. Instead, a stronger positive correlation exists between off-chain and on-chain volumes for high-cap assets, which enhances on-chain liquidity. This positive correlation is particularly evident in blockchains with higher liquidity and more mature ecosystems, where off-chain activity complements and bolsters on-chain trading. In contrast, long-tail assets exhibit a weaker correlation, suggesting that the impact of these swaps on on-chain liquidity is less pronounced for less liquid assets.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that correlation does not imply causation. While the results analyzed through the Granger causality tests suggest that these correlations might reflect a causal relationship, this evidence alone is insufficient to confirm causality. The Granger test indicates potential predictability between variables, but it cannot account for all possible external factors or underlying mechanisms driving these relationships. Therefore, while the findings provide strong indications of a causal link, further investigation, and additional methods would be necessary to establish causality.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-54097-recommendations-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-recommendations-16\"></a>Recommendations</h1>\n<p>The findings of this study indicate that the rise of intent-based protocols, while potentially beneficial for certain aspects of cross-chain functionality, could pose significant challenges to the liquidity dynamics of AMM-based decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. To address these potential challenges and ensure sustained growth and resilience, Uniswap could consider the following strategic recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhancing Liquidity on Smaller Blockchains</strong>: Based on our analysis, Uniswap should consider strengthening the infrastructure for intent-based protocols on smaller blockchains, primarily by deploying UniswapX on more blockchains. The positive correlation between off-chain and on-chain volumes indicates that improving on-chain volume could lead to increased fees and, consequently, more incentives for liquidity providers to contribute to these networks. Uniswap is already paving the way for this by implementing the ERC-7683 standard and deploying UniswapX cross-chain, which leverages this framework. To maximize the impact of these initiatives, Uniswap should also enhance support for solvers and simplify their onboarding process, attracting more participants and further boosting liquidity on smaller blockchains. The practical steps should be as follows:\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Deploy UniswapX on Target Blockchains</strong>: The governance should vote on and allocate resources towards expanding UniswapX to smaller blockchains such as Base or Optimism. Prioritize blockchains with active user bases and liquidity needs, ensuring that deployment is efficient and aligns with market demand.</li>\n<li><strong>Create Incentive Programs for Solvers</strong>: Uniswap could introduce temporary incentives to encourage filling on smaller blockchains (e.g. protocol fee sharing, grants, etc).</li>\n<li><strong>Improve Solver Onboarding</strong>: To attract more solvers and market makers, Uniswap could allocate resources to streamline the onboarding process. This might include providing grants or subsidies for solver infrastructure, offering developer tools, and simplifying documentation, making it easier for new solvers to participate.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Uniswap should regularly monitor the evolving landscape of intent-based protocols and their impact on on-chain liquidity. By staying informed and adapting its strategies accordingly, Uniswap can ensure it remains competitive and responsive to the dynamic changes in the decentralized finance ecosystem. This could involve periodic reviews of data, user behavior, and market developments to make adjustments as needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Tailoring Strategies</strong>: Uniswap should consider these dynamics when implementing new features. For Ethereum, where off-chain volume significantly impacts on-chain behavior, strategies that closely integrate off-chain and on-chain data could be crucial. On Base and Arbitrum, however, more tailored approaches that focus on strengthening on-chain liquidity or optimizing cross-chain interactions might be needed to ensure that the off-chain innovations translate effectively into these ecosystems.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider Alternative Cross-Chain Solutions</strong>: If off-chain volume is found to impact on-chain liquidity negatively, Uniswap should explore the implementation of alternative cross-chain solutions proposed in the CAKE framework (see references) that do not rely on intent-based mechanisms. By diversifying its approach to cross-chain functionality, Uniswap can mitigate potential risks to on-chain liquidity and maintain a robust and balanced ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-54097-future-work-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54097-future-work-17\"></a>Future work</h2>\n<p>While this research provides insights into the potential impact of intent-based protocols on on-chain liquidity, several ways for future research remain open. Expanding the scope of the analysis to include a broader range of blockchains and token pairs would help validate and generalize the findings.</p>\n<p>Comparative analyses between the different solutions proposed in the CAKE models and their impact on the Defi landscape would be another valuable area of research. These comparisons could highlight different chain abstraction solutions’ relative strengths and vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Finally, simulations that model the potential impact of full adoption of the ERC-7683 standard across various ecosystems could help anticipate risks and inform the development of mitigation strategies. By pursuing these lines of inquiry, future research can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by intent-based protocols in decentralized finance.</p>\n<p><em>(references and acknowledgements below)</em></p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-steps-for-uniswap-to-take-in-light-of-research-on-how-intent-based-protocols-are-shaping-on-chain-liquidity/24586\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-steps-for-uniswap-to-take-in-light-of-research-on-how-intent-based-protocols-are-shaping-on-chain-liquidity/24586","pubDate":"Mon, 16 Sep 2024 11:15:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24586"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-steps-for-uniswap-to-take-in-light-of-research-on-how-intent-based-protocols-are-shaping-on-chain-liquidity/24586.rss","#text":"[RFC] Steps for Uniswap to take in light of research on how intent-based protocols are shaping on-chain liquidity"},"filter":false},{"title":"[RFC] AlphaGrowth - Growing Uniswap through Incentives, Distribution, and Co-Marketing","dc:creator":"alphagrowth","category":"Requests for Comment","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/b/b8b03a35919d77a4e9fcb21c6189ec984edf7ba0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qlPq2pE3dAAKceWWJJ8lS9BK6s0.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"UniswapBanner1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/b/b8b03a35919d77a4e9fcb21c6189ec984edf7ba0_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"UniswapBanner1\" data-base62-sha1=\"qlPq2pE3dAAKceWWJJ8lS9BK6s0\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/b/b8b03a35919d77a4e9fcb21c6189ec984edf7ba0_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/b/b8b03a35919d77a4e9fcb21c6189ec984edf7ba0_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/b/b8b03a35919d77a4e9fcb21c6189ec984edf7ba0_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DB1492\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-54069-rfc-growing-uniswap-through-incentives-distribution-and-co-marketing-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-rfc-growing-uniswap-through-incentives-distribution-and-co-marketing-1\"></a>RFC - Growing Uniswap through Incentives, Distribution, and Co-Marketing</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"p-54069-introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"p-54069-purpose-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-purpose-3\"></a>Purpose</h4>\n<p>In recent months, we’ve actively engaged dozens of Uniswap stakeholders, gathering diverse perspectives from across the ecosystem.

We’ve helped dozens of projects go multichain. Throughout this process, members of Compound DAO encouraged us to design and implement a comprehensive growth program to address stagnation in the protocol. As of today, we lead growth for Compound.Finance. Some wins at Compound include securing nearly $4M in incentives for Compound users, the launch of 7 new markets and 30+ new collateral assets, and a TVL growth of over $400M. <a href=\"https://www.comp.xyz/t/alphagrowth-quarterly-report-400m-added-in-tvl-and-user-growth/5717\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Here</a> is the most recent quarterly report of our Growth program at Compound.

We, like many members of the community, see Uniswap as a pioneer with great power. Without an organized forward trajectory of pioneers like Uniswap and Compound, we risk seeing the industry spin its wheels.</p>\n<p>Uniswap has done a tremendous job setting the gold standard for how we trade assets on-chain. The Uniswap product, brand, and community are some of the strongest in DeFi.</p>\n<p>We are here because we believe that Uniswap will be the liquidity layer of the internet; and we want to help get it and keep it there.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54069-co-contributors-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-co-contributors-4\"></a>Co-contributors</h3>\n<p>This post was guided by the opinions of numerous Uniswap delegates, each bringing their own perspectives and expertise.

Teams like Oku are often marketing new deployments, opportunities, and feature updates on their own—efforts that could be amplified by the Uniswap ecosystem if a mechanism were in place. At present, the lack of a standardized process for co-marketing initiatives is causing missed opportunities for organic growth. If Bunni, a layer on top of Uniswap, wants to offer $1M of incentives to specific Uniswap pools, what’s the best way for them to share this with the Uniswap community? Uniswap is missing a place for ecosystem partners to engage, cross-pollinate, and share opportunities with users.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Onboarding Package referred to <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/update-uni-v3-v2-deployment-process-march-2024/23468/4\">here</a> offers network partners tremendous value. However, many chains are unaware that this opportunity exists. Currently, no outbound team is promoting the Onboarding Package and inviting chains to apply. The latest UAC report mentioned that the current impact of programs like the URGP can also be increased if the DAO were to establish a marketing team:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"AbdullahUmar\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"24492\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sea2.discourse-cdn.com/business6/user_avatar/gov.uniswap.org/abdullahumar/48/7920_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-accountability-committee-uac-season-2-report/24492/1\">Uniswap Accountability Committee (UAC): Season 2 Report</a></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It may be worth considering a marketing group for the DAO to more reliably and freely communicate campaigns, events, and proposals to the broader DeFi community.

If we don’t secure these incentives for Uniswap users, other more growth-oriented DEXes will. Without this additional firepower, it will be increasingly difficult to retain and grow the Uniswap protocol and user base. Many DEX teams on L2s collaborate directly with core ecosystem teams to secure these incentives. If we don’t run this race, we will continue losing market share.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-54069-why-market-opportunities-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-why-market-opportunities-11\"></a>Why market opportunities?</h4>\n<p>Simply put, DeFi users must be aware of opportunities if they are to capitalize on them. If Uniswap launches on a new chain, there needs to be a greater marketing push so that the incentives are effectively utilized. Additionally, without distribution, only power users and insiders will have visibility into these opportunities. Finally, ecosystems will be much more willing to offer us incentives if we plan on shouting the opportunities from the rooftops.</p>\n<p>Beyond marketing these opportunities to users, marketing opportunities (like the Onboarding Package) to chains will make them far more likely to offer Uniswap users reciprocal incentivization.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-54069-why-highlight-and-co-market-with-ecosystem-partners-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-why-highlight-and-co-market-with-ecosystem-partners-12\"></a>Why highlight and co-market with ecosystem partners?</h4>\n<p>When we co-market, we not only increase visibility for our initiatives but also strengthen the loyalty of key partners. By highlighting partner contributions and opportunities, we create a virtuous cycle where partners are incentivized to do and offer even more to the ecosystem. Co-marketing is another way of showing appreciation to the Uniswap Ecosystem’s talented contributors. Many of these partners have opportunities and incentives for Uniswap users to capitalize on. In addition to Oku, projects built on top of Uniswap, such as hook builders, are seeking a clear co-marketing channel. By neglecting our ecosystem partners, we’re missing out on opportunities that drive value, contribution, loyalty, and organic growth around V4 and beyond.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-54069-what-solutions-do-we-propose-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-what-solutions-do-we-propose-13\"></a>What solutions do we propose?</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"p-54069-uniswap-ecosystem-incentives-initiative-ueii-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-uniswap-ecosystem-incentives-initiative-ueii-14\"></a>Uniswap Ecosystem Incentives Initiative (UEII)</h4>\n<p>Let’s dive deeper into the program teased by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/pgov\">@PGov</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/abdullahumar\">@AbdullahUmar</a> from the Metagovernance team earlier this week. (<a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-ecosystem-incentives-initiative/24548\">Forum Post</a>) To distribute the most value to Uniswap users, when it comes to sourcing incentives, we propose leveraging our dedicated team to help the Metagov team. This outbound initiative will include members of the AlphaGrowth, PGov, and Arana teams, focusing on securing grants and incentives for the DAO and Uniswap users.</p>\n<p>The initial focus will be on <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/official-uniswap-v3-deployments-list/24323\">chains where Uniswap is currently deployed</a>, capitalizing on the lower-hanging fruit. Depending on the goals of the issuing partners, these grants and incentives can be distributed in several ways: allocated to liquidity providers on specific chains / liquidity pools (e.g., stablecoins, LSTs, LRTs), used to subsidize transaction costs and trading fees, or directed toward other creative initiatives.</p>\n<p>When reaching out to prospective chains, we’ll leverage our experience, the existing DAO programs like the Onboarding Package, and we’ll collaborate with the Metagov team (currently the UADP) to strengthen our pitch.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes these grants require KYC/KYB, which we’ll handle through ReservoirDAO, AlphaGrowth’s sister company DAO LLC in the Marshall Islands. This is how we’ve successfully claimed and distributed incentives for Compound. We’re fully doxed and ready to facilitate the process. We’ll provide the infrastructure to make it even easier to secure incentives.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-54069-a-dedicated-team-to-market-incentives-and-opportunities-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-a-dedicated-team-to-market-incentives-and-opportunities-15\"></a>A dedicated team to market incentives and opportunities</h4>\n<p>To ensure these opportunities and incentives are shared far and wide, we propose leveraging our growth-marketing team. As we secure these grants and incentives, our mission is to strategically promote and distribute this alpha across the DeFi space, increasing TVL, volume, and activity on Uniswap.</p>\n<p>Based on the success we’ve had running campaigns around the distribution of millions in incentives to Compound users, the primary marketing channel we recommend is Twitter. Promoting engaging content will help mitigate the cold-start problem. Additionally, ensuring visibility on industry-leading platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko will keep Uniswap top-of-mind for ideal audiences. If there are other channels that the DAO would like to see activated, we are more than happy to entertain these options.</p>\n<p>Our team will work closely with the Accountability Committee, Oku and others to identify the best opportunities to prioritize the roadmap of future Uniswap deployments. Over the past year, for instance, the DAO has approved the deployment of Uni V3 on over a dozen EVMs, but there has never been a DAO-led push to ensure that individuals outside of the DAO are aware of these deployments. We will act as that bridge between the DAO and the broader DeFi community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54069-a-dedicated-program-to-vet-and-highlight-ecosystem-partners-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-a-dedicated-program-to-vet-and-highlight-ecosystem-partners-16\"></a>A dedicated program to vet and highlight ecosystem partners</h3>\n<p>In order to offer reciprocity to partners and opportunities to users, we’re proposing the creation of a program dedicated to highlighting the most exciting and valuable opportunities within the Uniswap ecosystem, especially with Uni V4 hooks. Partners can apply to this program for co-marketing / promotion, and our team will review, qualify, and KYB each opportunity (to prevent any bad actors from being promoted). If the partner’s application meets the requirements of the review committee (and the team passes KYB), the opportunity will be greenlit for our marketing team to promote.</p>\n<p>The review committee will consist of several members who will first establish the criteria for what qualifies as worthy of co-marketing. Once the criteria are set, the team will meet weekly to vote on co-marketing opportunities from various partner applications. The goal is to highlight opportunities in the Uniswap ecosystem, particularly with the launch of V4 hooks and teams offering user incentives. While AlphaGrowth will handle the admin work, KYB, promotion, and distribution, having a diverse group of quality voices on the review committee is optimal. If an application has a majority vote and quorum, it will be advanced to the marketing team for promotion.</p>\n<p>Here are some DAO members who have verbally committed interest in being a part of this proposed co-marketing review committee:</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/juanbug\">@Juanbug</a> | Governance, PGov<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/abdullahumar\">@AbdullahUmar</a> | Governance, Arana Digital<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/cole_404\">@Cole_404</a> | Governance, 404 DAO<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/pennblockchain\">@Pennblockchain</a> | Governance, FranklinDAO<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/zeebradoom\">@Zeebradoom</a> | Governance, CalBlockchain<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/hugob\">@Hugob</a> | Governance, ChicagoDAO<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/michiganblockchain\">@Michiganblockchain</a> | Governance, Michigan</p>\n<p>We are also more than happy to hold an election to decentralize the creation of this review team.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54069-reporting-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-reporting-17\"></a>Reporting</h3>\n<p>To maximize transparency, efficacy and attribution of these programs, we will regularly analyze and report campaign success metrics. Some of these metrics include engagement rates, TVL growth, trading volume, daily/monthly active users, and new wallets created.</p>\n<p>We will post quarterly progress reports on the forum to ensure the Uniswap community is in the loop and that our efforts are public.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-54069-whats-the-rationale-for-these-solutions-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-whats-the-rationale-for-these-solutions-18\"></a>What’s the rationale for these solutions?</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54069-we-know-that-people-respond-to-incentives-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-we-know-that-people-respond-to-incentives-19\"></a>We know that people respond to incentives</h3>\n<p>We’ve done it several times now. Our team has secured around $4M in grants and incentives for Compound.Finance users alone. In addition to Compound, we’ve helped numerous DeFi projects secure grants from a variety of ecosystems. We’ve been on both side of the equation; over the past few years, we also helped deploy millions in grants and incentives on behalf of the Aurora and Kava ecosystems. These incentives onboarded dozens of DeFi protocols and several hundred million in TVL. We learned what works, and more importantly, what doesn’t.</p>\n<p>The primary rationale behind this strategy is based on our success at Compound, where our approach to grants and co-marketing has driven significant growth. At Compound, we’ve secured and deployed nearly $4M in incentives and expanded into seven new markets. This resulted in significant TVL growth across multiple chains, including a jump from $51M to $200M million on Arbitrum alone. Based on our tried and true methods at Compound and elsewhere, we’re confident that Uniswap users will benefit greatly from this same playbook.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54069-if-we-dont-talk-about-it-it-wont-be-heard-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-if-we-dont-talk-about-it-it-wont-be-heard-20\"></a>If we don’t talk about it, it won’t be heard</h3>\n<p>As we (and other partners) create valuable opportunities, it’s important that we make DeFi aware of them. Without awareness, there’s little chance of action. It’s crucial to run campaigns that spread the word. Another successful example of this playbook was focused on users transitioning from bridged USDC.e to native USDC. We secured the incentives, incentivized an action, marketed the opportunity, and saw active wallets jump 4.5x over the course of a few months.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54069-ecosystem-partners-deserve-a-chance-in-the-spotlight-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-ecosystem-partners-deserve-a-chance-in-the-spotlight-21\"></a>Ecosystem partners deserve a chance in the spotlight</h3>\n<p>When speaking with several partners throughout the Uniswap Ecosystem, we learned that there is no easy way for them to cross-pollinate their communities and offerings with Uniswap users. These contributors are actively seeking more channels to reach the Uniswap community. Highlighting partners will give them even more reason to build, engage, and incentivize on Uniswap.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-54069-what-are-the-high-level-steps-for-implementation-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-what-are-the-high-level-steps-for-implementation-22\"></a>What are the high level steps for implementation?</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-54069-h-1-securing-incentives-ueii-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54069-h-1-securing-incentives-ueii-23\"></a>1.

We’ve been on both sides of the equation, and we now know what is looked for in each applicant. Since we already have our finger on the pulse of these grants programs, identifying these opportunities for Uniswap will be a simple activation. We will submit applications for Uniswap early and often. Additionally, we will engage all of Uniswap’s existing blockchain ecosystem partners to explore their appetite for a one-off incentive program. We have already received positive feedback from several of these chains looking to play ball and incentivize liquidity.</li>\n<li><strong>Creating new opportunities.</strong> In many cases, blockchain ecosystems have funds specifically set aside to incentivize user engagement, but these opportunities might not always be publicly announced through formal grants programs. To unlock these opportunities, we will leverage our relationships with various ecosystems.

The losses caused by this risk can be substantial and can potentially deter users from providing liquidity. Having a substantial amount of liquidity not only in major token pools but also in the mid and small sized tokens is necessary for the future of DeFi that lies in composability and swapping is the main building block today and tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Providing liquidity providers with an option to hedge fully or partially against Impermanent Loss would likely increase the volume of assets in Uniswap’s liquidity pools. This would stabilize liquidity availability as users would feel more secure about their investments and be less inclined to withdraw their capital. Additionally, new tokens are more likely to be listed on Uniswap, as the availability of this feature could be a key factor for the communities of newly listed tokens.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-54028-how-it-works-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54028-how-it-works-3\"></a>How it works</h2>\n<p>The design is straightforward. At its core is a liquidity pool that matches underwriters and buyers. On one side, buyers purchase the Hedge against Impermanent Loss, with the liquidity pool acting as the counterparty. On the other side, underwriters take on the Impermanent Loss risk. The liquidity pool ensures that buyers and sellers are matched over time…</p>\n<p>This hedge fully covers the Impermanent Loss, with a small excess payout due to the discrete nature of the hedge. For example, if the Impermanent Loss from a 10% price shift results in a $20 loss, the hedge would compensate $20, plus a small additional amount. Buyers pay a premium to acquire this coverage.</p>\n<p>The Hedge against Impermanent Loss is priced using a European options model. This approach offers two benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarity: European options are well-understood financial instruments, simplifying onboarding for underwriters and facilitating third-party distribution by arbitrageurs.</li>\n<li>Flexibility: Options act as market-priced conditional statements, and their P&amp;L profiles can be easily combined to create more complex structures that align with Impermanent Loss behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the background, the hedge is constructed as a portfolio of options with strike prices spread out to match available market conditions, resulting in a payout curve that has linear segments.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-54028-team-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-54028-team-4\"></a>Team</h2>\n<p>We are Carmine Finance.

In addition to bolstering liquidity and utilization of Uniswap across these chains, the allocated incentives have brought in thousands of unique addresses and users to the respective chains. Furthermore, participating in the governance of Arbitrum, and other target chains soon, through the UADP show the DAO’s willingness to engage and devote resources to the combined growth of both of our communities. Now, with the conclusion of our first ecosystem grant from Arbitrum, we are expressing our intention to expand our incentives initiative to other chains and deepen our relationships within those communities.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-53955-background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53955-background-2\"></a>Background:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Uniswap has voted to incentivize over a dozen deployments across various chains. Deployed incentives and chains are listed <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-deployments-accountability-committee-update-thread/21835/4\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Uniswap was a recipient of the initial Arbitrum airdrop, and with ~25% of the funds, a metagovernance program was started on Arbitrum. The voting rationale of the program is <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-delegate-program-uadp-communication-thread/22185\">here</a>; the program has gained delegation since and maintained 100% voting rate.</li>\n<li>The metagovernance team, UADP (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/juanbug\">@Juanbug</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/abdullahumar\">@AbdullahUmar</a>), applied for the Arbitrum long term incentives pilot program. More info <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-delegate-program-uadp-communication-thread/22185/11\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Uniswap received a grant of 1,000,000 ARB tokens. To show alignment, a matching incentives discussion was also started for Uniswap and <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/arbitrum-ltipp-incentive-matching/24066\">$750,000 of UNI was approved.</a></li>\n<li>The UADP then worked with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/gauntlet\">@Gauntlet</a> to distribute these tokens over 12 weeks, concluding recently in September. An in-depth report on the efficacy of this program will soon be delivered by the Gauntlet team.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-53955-going-forward-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53955-going-forward-3\"></a>Going forward:</h3>\n<p>With the success of the initial trial grant application on Arbitrum, we believe now is the time to move forward with expanding these initiatives. Many of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on administer tens of millions of dollars in grants, often without enough worthy applicants. We also believe that an additional level of alignment can be achieved with target chains if the DAO is able to hold a stake in their governance tokens. A vehicle like the UADP has proven successful in participating in Arbitrum governance, and such a setup extrapolated to other EVMs will be beneficial as well as the likelihood of attaining grants and sustaining reciprocating relationships is only increased if the DAO becomes an active participant.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-53955-grant-applications-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53955-grant-applications-4\"></a>Grant Applications:</h3>\n<p>We are interested in replicating what we did at Arbitrum, across the other deployments of Uniswap. This will be a much more intense venture, and are asking the community for feedback on what and where to focus. We believe this is a great opportunity to work closely with the AlphaGrowth team. They have been exploring ways of marketing the DAO in the broader ecosystem and have shown success running this playbook on Compound.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/alphagrowth\">@alphagrowth</a> is a DeFi and DAO service provider primarily working in the realm of growth through securing grants, growth-marketing, and Defi Operations. Today, they run all growth, business development, and marketing efforts for the Compound.Finance protocol. AlphaGrowth’s achievements at Compound include securing nearly $4 million in incentives for Compound users, launching 7 new markets and over 30 collateral assets, and driving a TVL increase of more than $400 million (<a href=\"https://www.comp.xyz/t/alphagrowth-quarterly-report-400m-added-in-tvl-and-user-growth/5717\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Quarterly Report</a>).</p>\n<p>Together with AlphaGrowth, some areas we want to focus on are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifying existing opportunities\n<ul>\n<li>To boost our current efforts, AlphaGrowth has been involved in grants programs for several years. Since they already have their finger on the pulse of so many grants programs, identifying these opportunities for Uniswap will be a simple activation. We will submit applications for Uniswap early and often. Additionally, we will engage all of Uniswap’s existing blockchain ecosystem partners to explore their appetite for one-off incentive programs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Creating new opportunities\n<ul>\n<li>In many cases, blockchain ecosystems have unspecified ecosystem funds set aside to incentivize user engagement, but these opportunities might not always be publicly announced through formal grants programs. To unlock these opportunities, we and AlphaGrowth will leverage our relationships with various ecosystems.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>KYC/KYB\n<ul>\n<li>Many grants/incentives require KYC/KYB. We can utilize ReservoirDAO, AlphaGrowth’s sister company, a DAO LLC in the Marshall Islands. This DAO LLC is how they have claimed and distributed incentives for Compound. Everyone is doxed and happy to facilitate this process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Incentive Distribution\n<ul>\n<li>Once we’ve secured the grants, we will distribute the incentives through various Uniswap partners. For our grant prior from Arbitrum, we used Gauntlet and Merkl. To distribute incentives at Compound, AlphaGrowth had great success using just Merkl and OKX. In addition to using these tried and true partners previously mentioned, we will identify the most effective distribution partners for Uniswap incentives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Marketing\n<ul>\n<li>As we open up more of these lucrative opportunities for Uniswap users, it’s crucial that there is visibility. In the coming days, AlphaGrowth will be pushing forward a high impact marketing plan similar to the one they have been running at Compound.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Working together on these pieces, we are confident we will have sufficient coverage and bandwidth to manage the chains</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-53955-expanded-metagovernance-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53955-expanded-metagovernance-5\"></a>Expanded Metagovernance:</h3>\n<p>Currently, Uniswap has only received self-delegation from Arbitrum as a part of the UADP team. In the future, this is an avenue that we are actively exploring to deepen our relationship with other teams. Being delegates builds trust from within and strengthens any grant application we submit. We will continue to look for good opportunities to become involved with other chains where Uniswap is deployed and even consider other complimentary communities if relevant.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-53955-next-steps-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53955-next-steps-6\"></a>Next Steps:</h3>\n<p>We want to start a discussion around the interest and scope of our plan. We can continue in our current state or scale up and appropriately cover these many bustling ecosystems. Namely, we would like to nail down the size and focus of this initiative. In the coming weeks, we will incorporate general feedback and ideas before moving forward with a full plan and budget.</p>\n<p>We will receive suggestions across a multitude of scopes with an ultimate goal of reaching community consensus on an execution plan. Thank you everyone for your time and we look forward to everyone’s opinions!</p>\n            <p><small>13 posts - 8 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-ecosystem-incentives-initiative/24548\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-ecosystem-incentives-initiative/24548","pubDate":"Tue, 10 Sep 2024 13:33:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24548"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-ecosystem-incentives-initiative/24548.rss","#text":"Uniswap Ecosystem Incentives Initiative"},"filter":false},{"title":"Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) - July/August Reporting","dc:creator":"fin_areta","category":"Governance-Meta","description":"<p>In early August we shared the <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-review-report/24372\">UAGP Review Report</a> with the DAO, which discussed everything from our operations as the UAGP committee, grant and program outcomes, key learnings, and the future prospects for the UAGP.

This can largely be attributed to the remaining milestones of grantees being larger downstream objectives, such as protocol launches.

DAO-led programs have also increased in quantity. Unfortunately, many of these proposals and conversations can get lost in the swath of forum posts, making it difficult to keep track of what’s important and timely. It also takes some time for new entrants to become familiar with the DAO’s existing initiatives. To increase clarity around monthly DAO occurrences, we are resuming governance community calls, now led by the Uniswap Accountability Committee (UAC).</p>\n<p>These calls will be hosted using Google Meets on the second Tuesday of every month, from 10am – 11am Eastern Time.

We will be recording each of the meetings and tracking the attendance for delegates that are a part of the delegate reward program.</p>\n<p>If you are ever interested in covering a particular proposal or discussion point regarding Uniswap governance in general, please feel free to reach out. Our team will collect a list of relevant topics for each call and contact authors of currently active proposals to ensure that they have a chance to directly interact with the community and fairly present their thoughts. The format of these calls will be a combination of quick, successive presentations from a couple of community members, followed by a live Q&amp;A/discussion.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-governance-community-calls/24530\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-governance-community-calls/24530","pubDate":"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 23:48:33 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24530"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-governance-community-calls/24530.rss","#text":"Uniswap Governance Community Calls"},"filter":false},{"title":"Uniswap Accountability Committee (UAC): Season 2 Report","dc:creator":"AbdullahUmar","category":"Requests for Comment","description":"<p><strong>Authors: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/abdullahumar\">@AbdullahUmar</a> (Arana Digital), <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/juanbug\">@Juanbug</a> (PGov), <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/frisson\">@Frisson</a> (Tally)</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/2/269ad395cbd4f8bbd4b0e9f9c01913cb39feb435.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/5vvRcF7NwJhyLRSLYQIoeIbzCJv.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/2/269ad395cbd4f8bbd4b0e9f9c01913cb39feb435_2_690x258.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"5vvRcF7NwJhyLRSLYQIoeIbzCJv\" width=\"690\" height=\"258\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/2/269ad395cbd4f8bbd4b0e9f9c01913cb39feb435_2_690x258.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/2/269ad395cbd4f8bbd4b0e9f9c01913cb39feb435.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/2/269ad395cbd4f8bbd4b0e9f9c01913cb39feb435.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"110D0F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>The purpose of this report is of two-fold:</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-53837-part-1-descriptive-report-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53837-part-1-descriptive-report-1\"></a>Part 1: Descriptive Report</h3>\n<p>This section outlines the operations and programs with UAC oversight and provides a financial recap of account balances and expenditures.</p>\n<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preface and Background</li>\n<li>Collaborating with Target Chains</li>\n<li>Escrow and Oversight for DAO Programs and Working Groups</li>\n<li>Multisig Operations</li>\n<li>Accounting and Financials</li>\n<li>Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program Campaigns</li>\n<li>Incentive and Liquidity Matching</li>\n<li>Deployment Record Management</li>\n<li>Community Call</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-53837-part-2-request-for-comment-rfc-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53837-part-2-request-for-comment-rfc-2\"></a>Part 2: Request for Comment (RFC)</h3>\n<p>Based on the information from Part 1, this section proposes a 7-month renewal of the UAC for Season 3 and requests rebalancing of program accounts under deficits.

In addition to our <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-create-the-uniswap-accountability-committee/21043\">original mandate</a> to “…liaise with projects seeking to deploy Uniswap; ensure deploying projects are correctly configured; and providing a recommendation to the community on whether to approve certain deployments”, we added a focus on managing official <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/61\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">deployment subdomain records</a>, driving market share by deploying incentives as part of the Uniswap <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/59\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">revitalization and growth</a> program (URGP), and scaling DAO operations by serving as an oversight and escrow committee for other DAO programs.</p>\n<p>The focus on driving market share in particular has proven consequential for the committee. We’ve deployed over $4M of DAO-funded UNI, with over $1M in matching funds from partner chains. This area of focus has demanded operational rigor from members, including a very high level of availability, the capability to create and audit complex onchain transactions, managing working groups’ financials, and strong business development skills. This season also added other overhead like accounting, logging transactions, and managing multiple multisigs.</p>\n<p>This report outlines the operations behind the UAC from this previous season, along with an update regarding the financial situation of DAO programs and working groups. The last section will act as the request for comment (RFC) to renew the UAC and balance accounts.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53837-collaborating-with-target-chains-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53837-collaborating-with-target-chains-5\"></a>Collaborating with Target Chains</h2>\n<p>Since Season 1, the UAC has been central to facilitating the deployment of Uniswap on numerous alternative EVM environments. We work closely with these target chains, helping them create their RFCs, provide resources for deploying relevant contracts, and walk them through the governance process for attaining the DAO’s stamp of approval. During Season 2, Rootstock, Zora, Blast, Mantle, Sei, Manta , Taiko, and Redstone have all been onboarded by the DAO–and existing deployments have received between $250k - $1M of liquidity incentives.</p>\n<p>Whenever a new chain onboards Uniswap into its ecosystem, the UAC is involved in overseeing and detailing that chain’s financial commitment to Uniswap. This primarily comes in the form of incentive or liquidity matching. One of the stipulations that the DAO has informally agreed on is giving priority to target chains that match Uniswap’s onboarding package. The onboarding package was introduced by the GFX Labs team in February 2024, and it can be split into three main parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>UNI Incentives</li>\n<li>Incentive Distribution Costs</li>\n<li>Front-end Integration</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The go-to provider for distributing funds has been Merkl–they take a 3% fee on the amount of incentives distributed, and if we’re looking to deploy incentives on a chain that they haven’t integrated yet with, the DAO must pay an integration cost of $21.6k.</p>\n<p>The go-to front-end for allowing users to actually use Uniswap v3 has been Oku. Their team charges a total of $105k per integration. Oku also handles the backend contract deployment and verification process. Some teams, namely Zora and Redstone, decided to collaborate with Protofire for deploying the v3 contracts. Redstone also used AW House for setting up their front-end. The UAC has had to be more hands-on with new entrants, assisting with the governance and contract deployment process. As soon as a team has experience with one deployment, the following deployments become much easier to handle.</p>\n<p>Some target chains have been fortunate enough to attain a spot on the canonical <a href=\"http://Uniswap.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap.org</a> front-end–however, we can never guarantee that a target chain will be able to receive such a spot. Depending on the need of the target chain, we will refer them to the above list of experienced deployers and front-ends. This list may over time expand as more providers enter the space. The UAC had conversations with the DapDap team, for example, to potentially increase the breadth of DAO-approved front-ends. Their team <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/enhancing-uniswap-presence-on-ethereum-layer-2s/24189\">released a proposal </a>asking the DAO for funding a handful of existing v3 deployments. This proposal never went to vote as the DapDap team felt a degree of hesitancy from the DAO around funding the program. As they are needed, the UAC will continue having these types of conversations going forward.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53837-escrow-and-oversight-for-dao-programs-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53837-escrow-and-oversight-for-dao-programs-6\"></a>Escrow and Oversight for DAO Programs</h2>\n<p>Maintaining lean–yet secure–operations is vital for any DAO. One of the ways DAOs run into operational and accountability issues is when treasury funds are haphazardly spread across various wallets. It’s more constructive to elect a trusted group of contributors, assigned with the responsibility to track and custody the DAO’s funds. The creation of new working groups or the approval of treasury-funded programs typically requires administering payroll or deploying funds for various initiatives. <strong>These operational responsibilities have largely been diverted to the UAC.</strong></p>\n<p>The UAC currently administers incentive distribution for the URGP–plus escrows and distributes payroll for the Delegate Compensation initiative, Uniswap Treasury Working Group, and the Delegate Reward Working Group.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53837-multisig-operations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53837-multisig-operations-7\"></a>Multisig Operations</h2>\n<p>For the most part, the UAC uses two multisigs to conduct its operations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary UAC Wallet Address: 0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C</li>\n<li>UAC Incentives Wallet Address: 0xEBCCf1ce13F63c6B98811F03964F51fC43cef851\n<ul>\n<li>This wallet is deployed across various EVMs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were four members as part of this multisig for Season 2–and the threshold for signage was ¾.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisig Members are same as UAC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Primary Wallet is in charge of receiving all token flows approved by the DAO. It acts as the escrow and distribution wallet for paying working groups. The Incentives Wallet is in charge of routing liquidity incentives from the URGP. This is in part done to prevent signing an unneeded number of transactions from the Primary Wallet as it is the foundational escrow unit. Dispersing incentives via interactions with the Merkl application is therefore conducted solely through the Incentive Wallet.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/d3d523268aa79f2fe849b2d8897dbf297f82e2b4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/udXoenNe0dwcuxOeP1POkC2PBdO.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d3d523268aa79f2fe849b2d8897dbf297f82e2b4_2_690x378.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"udXoenNe0dwcuxOeP1POkC2PBdO\" width=\"690\" height=\"378\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d3d523268aa79f2fe849b2d8897dbf297f82e2b4_2_690x378.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d3d523268aa79f2fe849b2d8897dbf297f82e2b4_2_1035x567.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/d3d523268aa79f2fe849b2d8897dbf297f82e2b4_2_1380x756.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"3D2134\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Incentives Wallet is also deployed across a number of other EVMs, like Base, Scroll, Manta, etc. This was required to deploy UNI incentives on all of these target chains. Earlier this summer, Merkl launched a cross-chain feature that allows the deployment and claiming of incentives directly on Ethereum Mainnet. For instance, we were able to use the Incentives Wallet on Ethereum to reward liquidity providers on zkSync. These LPs would then claim their rewards directly on mainnet instead of on zkSync, making it easier for them to swap in and out of UNI.</p>\n<p>We will likely continue using this cross-chain feature in the future to prevent the segmentation of funds and overhead with managing an increasing number of multisigs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53837-accounting-and-financials-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53837-accounting-and-financials-8\"></a>Accounting and Financials</h2>\n<p>The DAO currently does not have a system for tracking expenses, managing runway, or overseeing the treasury. There are separate initiatives addressing such needs–but the UAC has begun administering its internal accounts to better manage DAO funds and report their utilization over time. Routing funds for various programs to the UAC wallet will help manage DAO funds in a more prudent and standardized manner. We have also begun using more sophisticated tooling like DEN, ensuring proper tracking and labeling of transaction data.</p>\n<p>You may view the UAC as a DAO-adjacent entity, currently solely governed by a multisig and not a legal entity. Token flows in and out of the UAC multisig are–today–only denominated in the native $UNI token. The committee does not yet have the authority to buy and sell assets. This setup may alter in the future to ensure more flexible runway management, but it’s not a guarantee.</p>\n<p>Cash vs token-based accounting is a key concern to address. Almost every program that the DAO has voted in favor of so far has been quoted in US dollars. Since the UNI token is quite volatile, the dollar value of the funds assigned to a particular program upon execution may be significantly higher or lower than what was intended during either the RFC or voting period. Denominating programs in terms of dollars makes it much easier for delegates to conceptualize the cost of a particular program. Such a practice also eases communication with external parties. It’s easier to market a “$250k Incentive Package” versus a “35.7k UNI Incentive Package.” Plus, many of the approved programs are associated with a working group’s payroll, which is best denominated in dollars.</p>\n<p><strong>We are therefore requesting all future proposals that use the UAC as an escrow service to assign a dollar value to their requested budget. The UAC would like to periodically revisit these budgeted accounts and balance them if the dollar value of the given funds falls below the allotted amount.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>See the below analysis for detailed accounts (through mid-August):</strong></em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-53837-breakdown-of-inflows-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53837-breakdown-of-inflows-9\"></a>Breakdown of Inflows</h3>\n<p>Token inflows refer to funds sent from the Uniswap treasury to the Primary Wallet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Treasury Address: 0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Outflows simply refer to funds being sent away from the UAC’s control, either for the use of certain programs or for compensating DAO contributors.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/e/e2d0d3f77a4b900521a88082bd5f4259d7b3e14c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wmvjQZv9IHliv48e4A5vgNCVDQw.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/e/e2d0d3f77a4b900521a88082bd5f4259d7b3e14c_2_690x340.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"wmvjQZv9IHliv48e4A5vgNCVDQw\" width=\"690\" height=\"340\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/e/e2d0d3f77a4b900521a88082bd5f4259d7b3e14c_2_690x340.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/e/e2d0d3f77a4b900521a88082bd5f4259d7b3e14c_2_1035x510.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/e/e2d0d3f77a4b900521a88082bd5f4259d7b3e14c_2_1380x680.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"140E13\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>A total of four passed proposals led to an increased Primary Wallet balance.

The barrier for being considered an official Uniswap deployment was higher prior to January 2024, and the Michigan Blockchain team spent months vetting and negotiating liquidity commitments with Rootstock.

Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/61\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the Primary UAC wallet attained the ability to alter the text record</a> on the Uniswap deployments ENS subdomains. Whenever a set of contracts are considered official and are properly verified, the UAC is responsible for writing to the given subdomains.</p>\n<p>For more details, along with a comprehensive list of each of the deployed v3 contracts, <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/official-uniswap-v3-deployments-list/24323\">refer to this post</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53837-community-call-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53837-community-call-27\"></a>Community Call</h2>\n<p>The UAC will also be taking on the responsibility to administer monthly community calls going forward. These were previously hosted by Blockworks Research–but due to turnover in their team, they’re stepping away from this duty. Once the new UAC team is elected, we will release a new community call calendar for delegates and all interested parties to keep track of. We believe that continuing the community calls is an important aspect in helping consolidate month-to-month occurrences, allowing people to ask questions and stay in the loop with DAO developments.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-53837-part-2-rfc-28\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53837-part-2-rfc-28\"></a>Part 2: RFC</h1>\n<p>This section is divided into two RFCs–one for renewing the UAC and the other to rebalance accounts.

Collectively, with our new much expanded scope, we have contributed more than originally expected, which was the limited 10 hours/month per member. In total over 6.5 months, committee members have worked 359 hours, 99 hours more than the expected 260 hours for this time frame. Note that the extra hours have not been paid out. Today, the scope of the UAC can broadly relate to DAO operations, program oversight, and protocol growth–the specifics of these categories will continue to evolve to meet the needs of the DAO.</p>\n<p>Going forward, we propose a few key areas of focus for the committee:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposing new incentive programs, including a potential exploration into Protocol Owned Liquidity and other forms of growth beyond mere incentives</li>\n<li>Administering an operational framework for the Uniswap DAO to best sustain efficiency with ever increasing programs and working groups</li>\n<li>Continuing our role as an escrow service for DAO-funded programs</li>\n<li>Polishing our accounting and record-keeping to improve reporting</li>\n<li>Exploring and implementing growth programs related to Uni v4</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To accommodate this expanded focus, we propose the following next steps to operationalize the committee going forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add an additional member <strong>(going from 4 to 5 members)</strong> to increase work capacity and multisig security</li>\n<li><strong>Increase the maximum hours</strong> per member from 10 hours/month to 30 hours/month</li>\n<li>Institute a <strong>staggered election system</strong> to retain three current members on the committee–this helps retain momentum and continuity with existing projects. We believe a degree of stickiness with the UAC team is important since conducting the noted operations requires subject matter expertise and familiarity with the DAO.\n<ul>\n<li>Going forward, the UAC will internally hold a vote to decide which of the ⅖ members will be up for reelection–that is, if two members don’t resign by default</li>\n<li>For this election, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/0xpibblez\">@0xpibblez</a> has stepped down, so <strong>there are automatically 2 available seats for the Season 3 election</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Approve the $32.6k of wages payable to accommodate for Season 2 overtime</li>\n<li>Fund the committee with an <strong>additional $210,000 of $UNI for payroll through March 2025</strong> (this assumes that all 5 members spend 30 hours per month for all 7 months, given the $200/hour rate)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: The UAGP is funding legal research into an entity structure that would be suitable for the UAC. This would, among other aspects, allow the committee to sign incentive matching agreements with protocols to which Uniswap is being deployed. The introduction of a legal entity may change the dynamic of the UAC and its election setup as well.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53837-rebalance-accounts-in-deficit-temp-check-2-30\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53837-rebalance-accounts-in-deficit-temp-check-2-30\"></a>Rebalance Accounts in Deficit (Temp Check 2)</h2>\n<p>Fluctuations in the UNI token price means that the accounts for various programs become unbalanced–sometimes at a surplus and other times at a deficit. Since programs are almost always budgeted in terms of dollars, we are looking to top up those balances to ensure liabilities around sustaining elected DAO programs are covered. The temperature check associated with rebalancing will be run separately from the UAC Season 3 renewal vote–the vote will request 42,060 UNI.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/5/5f2a888f126fe7a80f0b180a6ccf887df02e0fe0.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dzSucC9EVFPSDtNYMb7ElPivsqs.png?dl=1\" title=\"Summary of Account Rebalancing Amounts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/5f2a888f126fe7a80f0b180a6ccf887df02e0fe0_2_690x289.png\" alt=\"Summary of Account Rebalancing Amounts\" data-base62-sha1=\"dzSucC9EVFPSDtNYMb7ElPivsqs\" width=\"690\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/5f2a888f126fe7a80f0b180a6ccf887df02e0fe0_2_690x289.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/5f2a888f126fe7a80f0b180a6ccf887df02e0fe0_2_1035x433.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/5f2a888f126fe7a80f0b180a6ccf887df02e0fe0_2_1380x578.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E3E0E2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Please revisit the “Accounting and Financials” section above for a granular demonstration of the summarized rebalancing numbers.</p>\n<p>We look forward to hearing the DAO’s feedback.</p>\n            <p><small>12 posts - 8 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-accountability-committee-uac-season-2-report/24492\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-accountability-committee-uac-season-2-report/24492","pubDate":"Thu, 29 Aug 2024 20:26:36 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24492"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-accountability-committee-uac-season-2-report/24492.rss","#text":"Uniswap Accountability Committee (UAC): Season 2 Report"},"filter":false},{"title":"Dhive - governance data tooling","dc:creator":"snowdot","category":"Governance-Meta","description":"<p>Gm everyone</p>\n<p>We’re excited to share with you our project <a href=\"https://dhive.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">⬡ Dhive</a>.

After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702\">https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702</a></p>\n<p>Incorporating these findings, the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative–Cycle 1 was <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-uniswap-delegate-reward-3-months-cycle-1/23837\">proposed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/64\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">launched</a> in June 2024.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53572-success-of-cycle-1-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53572-success-of-cycle-1-4\"></a>Success of Cycle 1</h2>\n<p>The 12 delegates that were selected under Cycle 1 maintained 100% voting participation rate for both offchain and onchain votes during this period. In addition, the Delegate Reward Initiative discussion attracted several new delegates.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>New Delegate Name</th>\n<th>Delegate Join Date</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>SEEDGov</td>\n<td>May 2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Curia</td>\n<td>June 2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tané</td>\n<td>June 2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bobbay</td>\n<td>July 2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Whetstone</td>\n<td>July 2024</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"p-53572-learnings-from-cycle-1-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53572-learnings-from-cycle-1-5\"></a>Learnings from Cycle 1</h2>\n<p>While Cycle 1 was simple and effective, there were several suggestions to have a tier system to incorporate different participation levels of delegates. In addition, various suggestions were shared on how to make a points system to determine the top delegate applicants more fair and objective.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-53572-cycle-2-proposal-details-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53572-cycle-2-proposal-details-6\"></a>Cycle 2 Proposal Details</h2>\n<p><strong>Application Eligibility</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There will be a week-long period for delegate candidates to submit their applications.

The highest number of available point would be 10.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Voting Participation</strong></p>\n<p>-Considering one of the primary roles of the delegate is to receive voting power from their delegators to vote on behalf for the best of Uniswap, voting participation is crucial to ensure quorums are met and malicious proposals are prevented. The total point amount from this category is 6. The onchain part is weighted more heavily due to its usual frictions such as gas cost, as well as its ability to dictate governance contract alterations and movement of treasury funds. The voting rate is based on the past 6 months.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Offchain Voting (Snapshot)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>80% and above : 2</li>\n<li>70% till 80% : 1.5</li>\n<li>60% till 70%: 1</li>\n<li>50% or below but above 0%: 0.5</li>\n<li>0% : 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>2. Onchain Voting</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>80% and above : 3</li>\n<li>70% till 80% : 2.25</li>\n<li>60% till 70%: 1.5</li>\n<li>50% or below but above 0%: 0.75</li>\n<li>0% : 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3. The date of the first on chain vote is 3 months or more (this is to counterbalance very new applicants who have few votes and able to get full points on the voting)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yes : 1</li>\n<li>No : 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>2. Proposal Authorship</strong></p>\n<p>-Helping to write proposals for Uniswap DAO is important. However, we also want to prevent low-quality or malicious proposals. Therefore, only passed votes would count. The total points for this category is 3. The onchain part is weighted more heavily once again.</p>\n<p>In case of non-binary proposals, if the choice equivalent to “No” was present, and the end voting result was another choice than “No”, then it would be considered as valid for below. For example, Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) Election wouldn’t be valid for the points as there’s no “No” vote . But [Temp] Uni Onboarding Package - BSC would be valid for the points as there was a choice of “Against”. And the voting result was “$1m”.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed offchain (snapshot) vote before.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yes, 2 or more : 1</li>\n<li>Yes, 1 : 0.5</li>\n<li>No: 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>2.Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed onchain vote before</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Yes, 2 or more : 2</li>\n<li>Yes, 1 : 1</li>\n<li>No: 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3. Other Governance Participation</strong></p>\n<p>-The full point for this category is 1. This category is to recognize other ways one could contribute to discussion regarding Uniswap Governance. This can be achieved by either</p>\n<p><strong>1. Joined Uniswap Gov Workshop Before</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Yes: 1</li>\n<li>No: 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Or</p>\n<p><strong>2. Joined Uniswap Community Call Before</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Yes: 1</li>\n<li>No: 0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Tie Breaker</strong></p>\n<p>-Ties will be decided by the date of the first on chain vote these applicants casted in order to reward those delegates that have been contributing to Uniswap governance for an extended period.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget</strong></p>\n<p>We are requesting 540,000 [6000 USD *6 Months *15 Delegates ] USD worth of UNI for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative.</p>\n<p>The total amount, once approved, will be sent to the Accountability Committee, which will be responsible for the monthly distribution of rewards to eligible delegates and the proposal authors. Since the total budget of the now disbanded Delegate Reward WG has not been fully used, administration of this reward program–including the creation of this proposal and the admin work behind verifying monthly delegate participation–will be paid for using the current balance of $41.6k. The monthly admin consumption will be communicated each month to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>On August 20th , the snapshot vote will go live as well as well as the Delegate Reward Delegate application process. The application process will end on 27th.</p>\n<p>On August 25th, assuming the snapshot vote passed, will proceed to Onchain vote.</p>\n<p><strong>Edits</strong></p>\n<p>The points between 50-60% will be 0.75 and 1.125, for offchain and onchain votes respectively.</p>\n            <p><small>26 posts - 13 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward-initiative-cycle-2/24404\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward-initiative-cycle-2/24404","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 16:29:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24404"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward-initiative-cycle-2/24404.rss","#text":"[RFC] Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 2"},"filter":false},{"title":"July '24 Uniswap Report","dc:creator":"Oku","category":"Uncategorized","description":"<p>Hello Uniswap Community,</p>\n<p>We published our most recent issue of the Uniswap Monthly Report, summarizing protocol metrics for July 2024.</p>\n<p>You can find our latest report at <a href=\"https://www.newsletter.oku.trade/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">newsletter.oku.trade </a> and subscribe for future monthly releases.</p>\n<p>Here’s the executive summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In July 2024, the Uniswap Protocol processed $59.02 billion in monthly volume (+7.7%) across $6.37 billion in liquidity (-2.1%), earning market makers $76.43 million in fees (-15.1%).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Across all chains, Ethereum saw the most Uniswap volume with $26.74 billion in v3 pools, seconded by Arbitrum.

The offchain vote (Snapshot) will be a weighted voting where each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices to help to assess three blockchain for Forse to analyze.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>In February 2024, the Uniswap DAO introduced the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program, which incentivizes users to participate in current and new deployments of Uniswap on different networks within the L2 space. The initial onboarding packages of this program cost the Uniswap DAO at least $3.5M worth of assets.</p>\n<p>We propose that Uniswap DAO engage with Forse, our DAO intelligence and analytics platform, to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth program and assess if the current approach drives real growth.</p>\n<p>By assessing the impacts of the Revitalization and Growth Program, the Uniswap DAO will have valuable insights to improve further iterations of the Revitalization and Growth Program or other incentive programs. Armed with this information, Uniswap DAO will be able to understand what was the most relevant user groups, and their acquisition cost, and evaluate if the Revitalization and Growth program effectively modified user behavior and led to increased stickiness of users, and therefore TVL and other top-level protocol metrics.</p>\n<p>Recently, StableLab supported the Arbitrum DAO as the Program Manager for the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program</a>, and we delivered a comprehensive <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stablelab-analyzing-stip-s-efficacy-and-ltipp-comparison/24777/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">analysis</a> of the STIP to the Arbitrium DAO.</p>\n<p>With Uniswap allocating over $3.5M worth of assets for the purpose of growing Uniswap’s market share, it is essential to ensure that the DAO analyses and reviews the impact of these incentives on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Forse?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forse.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Forse</a> is a data and intelligence platform built by StableLab helping DAOs analyze the impact of governance decisions in protocol growth, top-line metrics, and governance operations, including its cost and effort structures. <a href=\"https://www.stablelab.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">StableLab</a> is the leading provider of governance products and solutions for decentralized protocols.

With over 5 years of experience in Product Management, with focus on Web3 and Analytics products, he is also experienced in building DeFi protocols, having previously worked for other protocols in the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Specification</strong></p>\n<p>By analyzing the impact of these incentives, Forse by StableLab hopes to identify the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impact quantification of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program in top-line protocol metrics with the isolation of external factors influencing these metrics as far as permitted and reasonably possible.</li>\n<li>User segmentation and analysis based on archetypes of users to determine the types of users attracted through the incentive program.</li>\n<li>Post-Incentive user retention, reactivation, and user acquisition cost metrics.</li>\n<li>Per-dollar value of incentives compared to other ways of incentivising users (e.g. Airdrops, LP rewards, grants, …).</li>\n<li>User Retention and activity patterns over the time of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To see Forse in action, explore our <a href=\"https://dashboard.forse.io/main/arbitrum/grants_program/Short_Term_Incentives_Program\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">interactive dashboard</a> showcasing the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program. This provides a great example of what our output could be for Uniswap’s Revitalization and Growth Program.</p>\n<p><strong>Budget Request</strong></p>\n<p>The proposal requests $70,000 worth of UNI to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program so far for 3 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO, with 3 months of additional maintenance support and updates to analytics modules utilized in the live dashboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Three Blockchains Chosen by the Uniswap DAO</strong></p>\n<p>We believe it will be better for Uniswap to better understand the impacts of the Incentive program for protocols that are at least sizable. So the options will compose the top 6 blockchains by TVL.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Blockchains</th>\n<th>TVL</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum</td>\n<td>$2.596b</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Base</td>\n<td>$1.35b</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blast</td>\n<td>$838.46m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scroll</td>\n<td>$601.14m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Linea</td>\n<td>$519.15m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mantle</td>\n<td>$440.09m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zksync</td>\n<td>$77.19m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sei</td>\n<td>$70.62m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manta</td>\n<td>$39.74m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moonbeam</td>\n<td>$31.45m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polygon zkEVM</td>\n<td>$13.2m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Taiko</td>\n<td>$13.29m</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Next Steps</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Launching Snapshot vote to decide the top 3 blockchains as well as regarding whether to proceed with this proposal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proceed to Onchain Vote if the snapshot vote passes</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>17 posts - 11 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-forse-analytics-for-uniswap-revitalization-and-growth-program/24373\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-forse-analytics-for-uniswap-revitalization-and-growth-program/24373","pubDate":"Wed, 07 Aug 2024 22:40:26 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24373"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-forse-analytics-for-uniswap-revitalization-and-growth-program/24373.rss","#text":"[Temp Check] Forse Analytics for Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program"},"filter":false},{"title":"Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) Review Report","dc:creator":"fin_areta","category":"Governance-Meta","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/da1f124d4cad47f2b8ccb07c01aa8a85c141b2e9.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/v7AEQTFVPnNa8330LZtb3Q34yPT.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 12.12.31 PM\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/da1f124d4cad47f2b8ccb07c01aa8a85c141b2e9_2_690x379.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 12.12.31 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"v7AEQTFVPnNa8330LZtb3Q34yPT\" width=\"690\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/da1f124d4cad47f2b8ccb07c01aa8a85c141b2e9_2_690x379.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/da1f124d4cad47f2b8ccb07c01aa8a85c141b2e9_2_1035x568.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/da1f124d4cad47f2b8ccb07c01aa8a85c141b2e9_2_1380x758.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D5B2BD\"></a></div><p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/speech_balloon.png?v=12\" title=\":speech_balloon:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":speech_balloon:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Hi all, the Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) is coming to an end. It has been an exciting experience growing alongside the program since its <a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/vote/2/47\">inception</a> in November 2023. Over the 9 months since, we have been thrilled by the interest, quality, and enthusiasm of the people and projects building at the intersection of these two ecosystems. Through our initial program design &amp; operations phase, and beyond with our <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/extension-of-the-uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp/23369/4\">program extension</a>, we have felt that operating a cross-ecosystem program of this nature has given us the opportunity to see and feel first-hand the impact that grants have in realizing ecosystem growth; as it has always been a key piece to move crypto forward.</p>\n<p>This final UAGP review report, provided below, will present the details of our experience, including investigating program outcomes, sharing learnings, and looking at what lies ahead. As always since Day-1 with the UAGP, we highly encourage you to share your feedback, thoughts, or questions on this piece and on the program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1><a name=\"p-53486-table-of-contents-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53486-table-of-contents-1\"></a><strong>Table of Contents</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>I.

Abstract</h1>\n<p>As the Uniswap Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) reaches the end of its scheduled operation, we felt it necessary and important to share a retrospective of the program with the DAO.</p>\n<p>Given the UAGP’s novelty as a cross-ecosystem grant program, many learnings and insights can be taken away from our experience, which in turn will hopefully inspire and inform other programs looking to fund ideas that strengthen within or beyond the Uniswap ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This program report will cover everything from our operations as the UAGP committee, to grant and program outcomes, key learnings, and future prospects. Our aim is to continue the functioning system and progress through a new Grant Program for the Uniswap Ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-53486-ii-executive-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53486-ii-executive-summary-3\"></a>II. Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>Since its inception in November 2023, the Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP) has fostered significant interest and enthusiasm, successfully funding innovative projects at the intersection of these ecosystems.

Way Forward</h1>\n<p>As the UAGP closed to new applications at the end of July, we remain active for the next 6 months in a significantly reduced capacity (20%) for milestone-verification and reporting. Given the timelines laid out in our 12 grant outlines, we expect the remaining projects to have fully completed their grant milestones before the end of our UAGP reporting/funding coverage, for this, the remaining ~$81k USD worth of ARB in the treasury will be used to cover operational expenses.</p>\n<p>Further, and motivated by the feedback and outcomes of the first iteration of the UAGP, we are presently exploring a way forward to continue funding innovative projects that provide value to these core networks, and beyond in web3.</p>\n<p>Through the various awareness initiatives we ran over the course of the UAGP, the committee has noticed the quality and quantity of applications dip in recent weeks. Appreciating this, and in light of strong demand on the Uniswap core side for a grant program to support further ecosystem growth, we are currently in the works of iterating RFPs for Uniswap-focused grant program.</p>\n<p>In an effort to identify the most meaningful opportunities, we are looking to hold conversations with delegates, builders, and researchers within the ecosystem. Off the back of these conversations, we hope to be back with a program to further grow and strengthen the Uniswap ecosystem as it continues to lead the charge for DeFi, and all of web3.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-53486-vi-helpful-links-35\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#p-53486-vi-helpful-links-35\"></a>VI.

The crown jewel of this trading is the ETH/USDC pool on Ethereum mainnet. The pool between ETH/USD trading pairs is the most important pool within a chain’s ecosystem because it represents the transition between flight-to-safety and risk-taking.</p>\n<p>Most other pools within the AMM ecosystem utilize ETH as their pair asset. Pools generally do this, because ETH is correlated with most assets trading on blockchain-based markets. However, ETH is by definition not correlated with USDC, thus making it the most difficult pair to provide liquidity for in AMM markets.</p>\n<p>On July 27th, Aerodrome ETH/USDC overtook both the Uniswap ETH/USDC both on Base and Ethereum - marking the first time for this newcomer DEX.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/f/fc2f296ededda8d21a4e90b626b56859bf1badfb.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zYVmIeCSMdptvnFUkiprxStO8rh.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/fc2f296ededda8d21a4e90b626b56859bf1badfb_2_227x303.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"zYVmIeCSMdptvnFUkiprxStO8rh\" width=\"227\" height=\"303\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/fc2f296ededda8d21a4e90b626b56859bf1badfb_2_227x303.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/fc2f296ededda8d21a4e90b626b56859bf1badfb_2_340x454.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/f/fc2f296ededda8d21a4e90b626b56859bf1badfb_2_454x606.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"222126\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1817225900737654863\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1817225900737654863</a></p>\n<p>One could say that Aerodrome has now entered the decentralized exchange thunderdome.

This is the <a href=\"https://basescan.org/address/0xd0b53d9277642d899df5c87a3966a349a798f224#readContract\">ETH/USDC 5 bps pool</a>, which is also shown in black. For reference, the large orange share (labeled 52.4%) above is all pools outside of the top 10 combined.</p>\n<p>Observant readers will notice the difference between these two pools right away - the Aerodrome ETH/USDC pool has a 4 bps fee while the Uniswap v3 pool has a 5 bps fee. Because most retail users have nearly 0 price impact on their trades, liquidity differences between the two pools will not bring back flow. This is because the fee from the trade dominates the cost of trading on that pool. Liquidity mining alone will not bring back the flow. For the rest of this piece, we will focus on the ETH/USDC pools on both of the protocols.</p>\n<p>Most retail users’ trades are semi-sophisticated because they use interfaces to find the best routes for their trades. Because of this, the difference in 1 bp will cause sophisticated interfaces to choose Aerodrome over Uniswap.</p>\n<p>To test this, we labeled the top 400 interface contracts by volume as either retail or non-retail (ie MEV). We checked where interfaces were routing their volume to and how much volume is from arbitrage volume (volume routed from MEV bots). These lists can be seen in the queries below.</p>\n<p>Our sample is over the last 14 days as of the time of writing. On Uniswap Protocol, $293m of retail flow went into Uniswap v3. On Aerodrome, $425m of retail flow went into their Protocol. This is about a 45% difference in retail flow. This is significant, but the difference is not without a cost.</p>\n<p>The higher fee tier of the pool <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14604\">protects LPs more from arbitrage losses</a>. For reference, the arbitrage volumes on Aerodrome are $2.18b while the Uniswap Protocol was $588m, almost a 4 times increase. While there is a retail volume difference, the volume generated from arbitrage is massively different as well.</p>\n<p>Notice that while Aerodrome has higher retail volumes, the arbitrage volumes are also significantly higher. More importantly, the volume of non-retail trades is proportionately much more than on Uniswap Protocol. This means much more of the flow that the LPs of Aerodrome are taking is worse. Because fee-tiers are inversely proportional to arbitrage losses, while the difference between 4 bps and 5 bps may seem small, the inverse relationship combined means the impact of these fee differences is super-linear.</p>\n<p><strong>ETH/USDC volume categorized by originator on Aerodrome</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/d/dda20882831e70efb8649b31fc041afc59f1df2f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vCEFSXxlBAag0ZgxYbMSC26Kz1R.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/dda20882831e70efb8649b31fc041afc59f1df2f_2_624x357.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"vCEFSXxlBAag0ZgxYbMSC26Kz1R\" width=\"624\" height=\"357\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/dda20882831e70efb8649b31fc041afc59f1df2f_2_624x357.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/dda20882831e70efb8649b31fc041afc59f1df2f_2_936x535.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/d/dda20882831e70efb8649b31fc041afc59f1df2f_2_1248x714.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8D7CF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3946817/6639387\">https://dune.com/queries/3946817/6639387</a></p>\n<p>Note: The data is Jul 13th - Jul 27th and the selected ETH/USDC pool</p>\n<p>ETH/USDC volume categorized by originator on Uniswap v3</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/5/56c9f9d2ca7a44840c662f2bc0f72c80c3a23100.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/cnLNdfDcVaKZIZrAraZnKBuhG6I.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56c9f9d2ca7a44840c662f2bc0f72c80c3a23100_2_624x356.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"cnLNdfDcVaKZIZrAraZnKBuhG6I\" width=\"624\" height=\"356\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56c9f9d2ca7a44840c662f2bc0f72c80c3a23100_2_624x356.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56c9f9d2ca7a44840c662f2bc0f72c80c3a23100_2_936x534.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/5/56c9f9d2ca7a44840c662f2bc0f72c80c3a23100_2_1248x712.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F1DBD4\"></a></div><br>\nSource: <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3946818/6639388\">https://dune.com/queries/3946818/6639388</a><br>\nNote: The data is Jul 13th - Jul 27th and the selected ETH/USDC pool<p></p>\n<p>Not all flow is equal, and more volumes may not necessarily be better for LPs. However, there is also <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09494\">evidence</a> that Layer 2 Protocols significantly lower losses and increase LP capital efficiency - this is due to lower blocktimes and lower fees. Because of this, the market clearing fee for LPs on L2s may actually be lower than 5 bps. Because Uniswap v3 has fee-tiers chosen by governance + the initial deployers, it is likely that these fee tiers may not totally be accurate.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>In the analysis above, we suppose that the reason why Uniswap has lost market share to Aerodrome over the last 4 months is Aerodrome’s lower fee tier on its ETH-USDC pool. This pool has attracted more retail flow as Uniswap’s flows have remained similar. The increase in retail flow and lower fees have in turn attracted significant non-retail flow.</p>\n<p>Since Aerodrome is a Uniswap v3 fork, we see this analysis as good evidence of the viability of a lower fee pool for ETH-USDC on Base and suggest it as evidence to governance that this proposal has merit.</p>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<p>One benefit of Uniswap v3 is the incentive to collect liquidity into one pool, creating network effects.

This will overcome the effects from liquidity fragmentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>Just like the <a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488\">1 bp fee tier</a> originally proposed 3 years ago by Getty Hill, we propose to additionally add a 2, 3, 4 bps fee tier to Uniswap v3 on Base.</p>\n<p>You may question why we are proposing the creation of three new fee tiers when our analysis only focused on 4 bps. There are two reasons for this. For one, Aerodrome is able to adjust fees automatically on Base. We anticipate they may respond by lowering fees below 4 bps and want Uniswap Protocol to allow LPs to move without governance intervention if this happens.</p>\n<p>Second, we believe this analysis may be a single case study into a larger finding that the required fee for LPs on L2s may be lower than 5 bps. While Aerodrome highlights the success of a 4 bp fee tier, it’s unclear whether that’s the right market rate. It may be lower.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we note that this change should not be blindly repeated on other chains. The community should do further research on the success or failures of this program before executing it on another chain.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/e/e00e07a5a59b4f372d12b5f476c7ed9c4287b09a.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"vY50L3r1h8SXxYIdtoMBLTJ9ki6\" width=\"308\" height=\"168\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\n            <p><small>37 posts - 18 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-proposal-to-active-2-3-4-bps-fee-tiers-on-base/24346\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-proposal-to-active-2-3-4-bps-fee-tiers-on-base/24346","pubDate":"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 16:01:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24346"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-proposal-to-active-2-3-4-bps-fee-tiers-on-base/24346.rss","#text":"[RFC] Proposal to active 2, 3, 4 bps fee-tiers on Base"},"filter":false},{"title":"Whetstone Research Delegate Platform","dc:creator":"aadams","category":"Delegation Pitch","description":"<p>Key Information</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Whetstone Research</li>\n<li>Delegate ENS: whetstoneresearch.eth</li>\n<li>Delegate Address: 0xd18bff14A9541f146071B0b8292c2274e2AE3b8e</li>\n<li>Forum Username: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/u/aadams\">@aadams</a></li>\n<li>Twitter: whetstonedotcc</li>\n<li>Website: <a href=\"https://whetstone.cc/\">https://whetstone.cc/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>About Us<br>\nWe are a research team focusing on the future of onchain markets.

The Attackathon will consist of three phases: education, active code hunting, and result evaluation. The goal is to enhance the security of the Ethereum network, which in turn benefits the entire DeFi ecosystem, including Uniswap.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-2-motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-2-motivation-4\"></a>2 - Motivation</h1>\n<p>The Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi are introducing the first-ever “Attackathon” program, which is aimed to be the largest ever crowdsourced security audit contest conducted to augment security for the entirety of the protocol’s code.</p>\n<p>An Attackathon is a multifaceted event involving three phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before the Attackathon: A comprehensive education program on the protocol’s code delivered via live technical walkthroughs and Attackathon Academy content.</li>\n<li>During the Attackathon: Security researchers hunt for vulnerabilities in the code based on specific rules to qualify for rewards. Only impactful reports, as specified by the rules of the Attackathon, will be rewarded.</li>\n<li>After the Attackathon: Immunefi evaluates and compiles the results into an official Attackathon report, spotlighting top researchers with monetary rewards, NFT awards and a leaderboard.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although the Ethereum Foundation has a permanent bug bounty, it does not get the awareness and eyeballs it should get on the code. While the EF Bug Bounty has existed since 2015, it typically only receives 2-3 low-medium reports per week. Therefore, we hope that through this event we can draw more skilled security professionals to audit Ethereum and blockchain projects more broadly.</p>\n<p>Following recent large hard forks such as Dencun and Shapella, the Ethereum network has undergone significant changes, making this the ideal time to conduct an extensive security audit. Ensuring the protocol’s stability and security post-upgrade is crucial for maintaining trust and reliability.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-3-proposal-details-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-3-proposal-details-5\"></a>3 - Proposal Details</h1>\n<p>This Attackathon will be held fully online. Immunefi will host the contest on their platform and triage the bug reports, and the EF Protocol Security Research Team will judge the results together with representatives from client teams.</p>\n<p>The scope of this Attackathon program seeks to include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specification Bugs:\n<ul>\n<li>Safety/finality-breaking bugs</li>\n<li>Denial of service (DOS) vectors</li>\n<li>Inconsistencies in assumptions, like situations where honest validators can be slashed</li>\n<li>Calculation or parameter inconsistencies</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Client Bugs:\n<ul>\n<li>Spec non-compliance issues</li>\n<li>Unexpected crashes, RCE or denial of service (DOS) vulnerabilities</li>\n<li>Any issues causing irreparable consensus splits from the rest of the network</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Solidity Compiler Bugs</li>\n<li>Deposit Contract Bugs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The primary ask for the Uniswap community in supporting this project will be in funding, but any contributions to broadcast the program through socials would also be appreciated!</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-4-benefits-to-the-uniswap-community-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-4-benefits-to-the-uniswap-community-6\"></a>4 - Benefits to the Uniswap Community</h1>\n<p>Conducting the Attackathon now, following recent major hard forks of the Ethereum network, is crucial. These upgrades have brought significant changes, and a comprehensive security audit will ensure the protocol’s stability and security post-upgrade. This increased focus on security will attract significant attention to the Ethereum codebase, enhancing visibility and participation from security researchers.</p>\n<p>For the Uniswap community, this initiative has direct benefits. Enhancing Ethereum’s security directly improves Uniswap’s reliability and trustworthiness, as Uniswap’s security is inherently tied to Ethereum’s security. A secure Ethereum fosters a confident developer community, which benefits the entire DeFi ecosystem, including Uniswap. Moreover, by including the Solidity compiler in the competition’s scope, the Attackathon will specifically address potential vulnerabilities in the primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, which includes those used by Uniswap. Ensuring the security of the Solidity compiler will thus directly enhance the security of Uniswap’s smart contracts.</p>\n<p>Additionally, aligning with Ethereum’s security efforts offers cost-effective benefits. Uniswap will gain from top-tier security assessments without bearing the entire cost, ensuring a secure and robust environment for its operations. Furthermore, by upskilling security researchers now, we prepare them for future hard fork contests, enhancing the overall security readiness of the Ethereum and Uniswap ecosystems.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-5-cost-and-timeline-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-5-cost-and-timeline-7\"></a>5 - Cost and Timeline</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"h-51-sponsorship-tiers-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-51-sponsorship-tiers-8\"></a>5.1 - Sponsorship Tiers</h2>\n<p>Unicorn Partners (+75 ETH Commitment, Approx. $250,000) (limited to two sponsors)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank</li>\n<li>Participation in Attackathon Kick-off Twitter Space as a partner speaker</li>\n<li>Leaderboard Placement on Sponsor page</li>\n<li>Top-tier logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page</li>\n<li>Top-tier logo placement on the Program Education page and program report</li>\n<li>Call out in Press Releases and EF and Immunefi Program Announcement Blogs</li>\n<li>Digital Logo Placement in the results announcement at Devcon or a dedicated virtual event</li>\n<li>4x Devcon tickets</li>\n<li>25% Discount on Crowd Sec offerings [transferable]</li>\n<li>1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Panda Partners (+30 ETH Commitment, Approx. $100,000)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank</li>\n<li>Leaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page</li>\n<li>Mid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page</li>\n<li>2x Devcon tickets</li>\n<li>10% Discount on Immunefi Crowd Sec offerings [Transferable]</li>\n<li>1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"h-52-timeline-and-key-dates-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org#h-52-timeline-and-key-dates-9\"></a>5.2 - Timeline and Key Dates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>July 8-11: EthCC program announcement</li>\n<li>August 8: Detailed program announcement and education kickoff.</li>\n<li>September 1st: Attackathon hunting begins.</li>\n<li>October 31st: Attackathon concludes, and results compilation begins.</li>\n<li>November 9-17: Results announced.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>8 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-ethereum-foundation-attackathon-sponsorship/24343\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-ethereum-foundation-attackathon-sponsorship/24343","pubDate":"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 13:53:54 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.uniswap.org-topic-24343"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-ethereum-foundation-attackathon-sponsorship/24343.rss","#text":"[RFC] - Ethereum Foundation Attackathon Sponsorship"},"filter":false},{"title":"[RFC] Forse for Uniswap Analytics for Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program","dc:creator":"Doo_StableLab","category":"Requests for Comment","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/63ebb1abd7be4fc6c828a78f6d9bfd3a8aefe736.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/efWeZ6bR0AL5Ck6ZXVyKC1AgxLM.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/63ebb1abd7be4fc6c828a78f6d9bfd3a8aefe736_2_624x167.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"efWeZ6bR0AL5Ck6ZXVyKC1AgxLM\" width=\"624\" height=\"167\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/63ebb1abd7be4fc6c828a78f6d9bfd3a8aefe736_2_624x167.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/63ebb1abd7be4fc6c828a78f6d9bfd3a8aefe736_2_936x250.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/6/63ebb1abd7be4fc6c828a78f6d9bfd3a8aefe736_2_1248x334.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"0B1820\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Simple Summary</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to onboard Forse by StableLab as a data service provider, helping analyze the effectiveness of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>The Uniswap DAO recently introduced the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program which incentivizes users in current and new deployments of Uniswap in different networks within the L2 space.

The Accountability Committee will be responsible for updating this thread.</p>\n<p><strong>What does it mean for a deployment to be “official”?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uniswap v3 was initially released under a BUSL license to prevent others from forking the protocol and using it for commercial purposes. As of April 2023, the BUSL was converted to an open-source license, allowing for the commercial usage of the v3 contracts. Such a transition can lead anyone to deploy the relevant v3 contracts on any EVM, claiming those contracts to be “the official Uniswap”.</li>\n<li>In order to prevent entities apart from the Uniswap DAO, who may or may not have ill intentions or an ulterior motive behind deploying the given v3 contracts, the Uniswap Foundation implemented <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/38\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a process</a> to officiate deployments across numerous EVMs.</li>\n<li>This grants authority solely to the Uniswap DAO to declare which v3 deployments are official, thereby preserving Uniswap’s reputable brand. Any target chain that would like to introduce an official Uniswap deployment to their ecosystem must abide by the appropriate governance channels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Until April 2024, the process for declaring a v3 deployment as official required a multi-step process, culminating in an onchain vote where the given deployment would be added to the v3 subdomain. The DAO now follows<a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/61\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> a simpler model</a>, where a deployment is optimistically considered official if the DAO does not veto deployment onto the given chain during a Snapshot vote.
