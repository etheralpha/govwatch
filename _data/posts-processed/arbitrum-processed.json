This is the third and final case study of a three-part series that entails an in-depth analysis of the risk and efficiency of the Arbitrum STIP on three major protocols, the third of which is Pendle Finance.</p>\n<p>As requested by the DAO advocate for the ARDC, L2BEAT, Chaos Labs has been conducting case studies on STIP recipients. This case study provides an in-depth analysis of the Arbitrum STIP program’s impact on Pendle Finance, focusing on its efficiency and associated risks. This analysis is part of a broader series that evaluates the STIP program across three major protocols.</p>\n<p>Following our previous analyses of Vertex and Silo Finance, we now turn our focus to Pendle Finance to provide a comprehensive evaluation of its performance and risk profile.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-3\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<p>An in-depth, bottom-up analysis of the protocol is essential to comprehensively understand the specific risks and efficiency factors influencing the Pendle STIP allocation. The initial section of this report delves into all pertinent aspects of Pendle Finance’s functionality, providing context and reference.</p>\n<p>Following this, detailed analyses of efficiency and risk are conducted, using the insights gained from the protocol deep-dive as a foundation. This analysis aims to identify all factors that could potentially result in adverse outcomes. These findings are then used to derive positive and negative insights from the Pendle STIP incentive program, which will inform the design of future incentive schemes.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive Amount:</strong> 2m ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive Uses:</strong> Liquidity incentives (55%), trading incentives (40%), Ecosystem integrations (5%)</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Matching:</strong> Yes</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pendle-overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-overview-4\"></a>Pendle Overview</h1>\n<p>Pendle is a permissionless yield-trading protocol where users can execute various yield-management strategies. This is achieved by first wrapping yield-bearing tokens into Standardised Yield (SY) tokens. SY tokens are compatible with the Pendle AMM and can be split into its principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token), respectively. This process is called yield tokenisation and allows both PT and YT to be traded on Pendle’s AMM.</p>\n<p>By creating a yield market in DeFi, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield, enabling users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed yield (e.g. earn fixed yield on stETH)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long yield (e.g. bet on stETH yield going up by purchasing more yield)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Earn more yield without additional risks (e.g. provide liquidity with your stETH)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A mix of the above strategies</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each PT and YT has a maturity date. For PT, you can redeem the full underlying yield-bearing token after this date. For YT, the yield of the yield-bearing token is only accrued up until the maturity date, after which YT has no value.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-liquidity-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-liquidity-5\"></a>Pendle Liquidity</h2>\n<p>Pendle liquidity comes from holders of yield-bearing tokens wrapping and depositing them into AMM pools. These liquidity providers then earn swap fees, PENDLE rewards, and any other incentives on top of the tokens’ native yield. The fixed maturity nature of these pools also means that if LPs keep providing liquidity until maturity, there will be no impermanent loss, and they will receive their initial tokens back along with the additional yield.</p>\n<p>During the STIP, Pendle launched an Order Book system alongside its AMM to enable peer-to-peer trading of PT and YT. This allows users to place limit orders to buy or sell at a specified implied APY.</p>\n<p>Together, the Order Book and AMM enhance market liquidity, facilitating smoother trading on Pendle.</p>\n<p>The total liquidity in a pool impacts slippage and is therefore crucial for user experience and seamlessly offering the use cases users desire.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-trading-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-trading-6\"></a>Pendle Trading</h2>\n<p>Liquidity pools in Pendle V2 are set up as PT/SY, e.g. PT-aUSDC / SY-aUSDC. Swapping PT is a straightforward process of swapping between the two assets in the pool, while swapping YT is enabled via flash swaps in the same pool.</p>\n<p>Flash swaps are possible due to the relationship between PT and YT. As PT and YT can be minted from and redeemed to its underlying SY, we can express the price relationship:</p>\n<p>P(PT) + P(YT) = P(Underlying)​</p>\n<p>Knowing that YT price has an inverted correlation against PT price, we use this price relationship to utilise the PT/SY pool for YT swaps.</p>\n<p>Traders on Pendle obtain SY tokens by depositing yield-bearing tokens, and swap them to gain exposure to the token of their choice. As yields change they then have the option to trade further to alter their exposures.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pendle-yield-token-integrations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-yield-token-integrations-7\"></a>Pendle Yield Token Integrations</h2>\n<p>A key feature of Pendle’s principal and yield tokens is their ability to support strategies that create specific exposures for users, enabled by ecosystem integrations with other protocols. Pendle offered incentives for depositing PT or LP positions into specific pools on other protocols to foster the broader ecosystem, liquidity, and trading activity. This initiative began in Week 5 of the program and was adjusted based on general market sentiment.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"use-of-incentives-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#use-of-incentives-8\"></a>Use of Incentives</h1>\n<p>The objectives for the STIP, as stated by Pendle, were:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Increasing yield trading volume, inciting activity on the platform, deepening liquidity on existing pools as well as an additional incentive for users to bootstrap liquidity for newly listed Pendle markets Arbitrum, and finally to encourage activity on protocols built on top of Pendle.</strong></em></p>\n<p>This was implemented by allocating 55% of incentives towards liquidity providers on Pendle, 40% towards trading incentives, and 5% to ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidity-incentives-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquidity-incentives-9\"></a>Liquidity Incentives:</h2>\n<p>Slightly over half of the total incentives were allocated to boosting additional yield for LPs, aiming to encourage deeper liquidity and reduce slippage on Pendle.</p>\n<p>Initially, Pendle distributed liquidity incentives based on vePENDLE votes for Arbitrum pools. However, this approach soon proved suboptimal as the incentives were neither distributed broadly nor targeted at the most active markets or new markets needing support. Starting from week 3, the Pendle team took over the allocations, using metrics such as the most active yield markets and new pools requiring initial liquidity. Additionally, there was significant experimentation and iteration in the weekly allocations.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows the evolution of weekly incentives by category. Over the course of the STIP, incentives were redirected from LST and derivative LP markets to lending, LRT, and Silo Pendle LP markets in response to market interest.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/clqSs4QQ4Dd0xdDuTrwCBxI4npy.png?dl=1\" title=\"The Evolution of Pendle Weekly Incentives by Category\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_690x439.png\" alt=\"The Evolution of Pendle Weekly Incentives by Category\" data-base62-sha1=\"clqSs4QQ4Dd0xdDuTrwCBxI4npy\" width=\"690\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_690x439.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_1035x658.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/56865649415e7e50d1104121816ee727cdee6a4c_2_1380x878.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"222729\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"trading-incentives-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trading-incentives-10\"></a><strong>Trading Incentives</strong>:</h2>\n<p>Trading incentives were designed as campaigns targeted at increasing trading activity on Pendle. The initial STIP application suggested that there would be “at least one campaign per month will be done to keep things fresh and to entice users to keep trying out the campaigns.” Over the course of the STIP, the following campaigns were conducted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Swap fee rebates:</strong> This campaign refunded a portion of traders’ swap fees with ARB tokens. The rebate was set below 100% to ensure wash trading remained unprofitable, starting at 75% and reducing to 50% in week 9. This campaign ran for the entire duration of the STIP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trading leaderboard with prizes for the most successful traders:</strong> An in-app leaderboard showcased the top-ranked users based on percentage gain. These top performers received ARB rewards to stimulate more trading volume and TVL. Performance-based prizes also incentivized traders to improve their strategies, aiding in long-term retention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Supercharged swap fee rebates:</strong> For a limited time, certain pools had their swap fee rebates increased to 120% to further incentivize trading activity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Maker incentives to promote the new limit order book feature:</strong> Rewards were provided for using Pendle’s newly launched limit order feature. Filled limit orders earned ARB rewards proportional to the order size, drawing attention to this innovation. Pendle’s limit orders were initially launched on Arbitrum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"ecosystem-incentives-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ecosystem-incentives-11\"></a>Ecosystem Incentives:</h2>\n<p>Ecosystem incentives were designed to integrate Pendle tokens further into the broader DeFi ecosystem by encouraging their use on partner protocols. Large lending pools that accepted Pendle LP or PT tokens as collateral received ARB incentives to boost their usage. The incentivized protocols included Stella, Dolomite, Timeswap, Silo, and Teller.</p>\n<p>Similar to the liquidity incentives, the focus of these incentives evolved throughout the STIP. Notably, in February 2024, the incentives shifted to emphasize leveraged strategies using LRT PT tokens, aligning with the development of these markets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"pendle-incentives-impact-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pendle-incentives-impact-12\"></a>Pendle Incentives Impact</h1>\n<p>The objective of this impact assessment is to evaluate the effects of the incentive program on protocol activity, specifically examining the demand for holding Pendle PT and YT tokens, trading activity and liquidity provision on Pendle’s AMM. This detailed, bottom-up analysis scrutinizes individual components of the STIP, which are unique to Pendle. This allows a clear prescription of how the results of the program were obtained and how this could be applied to other protocols. The unique nature of the Pendle protocol makes direct comparison impossible, but important incentive principles can be gleaned from their program strategy.</p>\n<p>Despite the STIP program’s short-term nature, this report assesses its prolonged benefits by analyzing protocol usage data following the program’s conclusion. The intention is to identify persistent activity changes and what drove them.</p>\n<p>Pendle accepts deposits of yield-bearing assets, wraps these into standardized yield (SY) tokens, and splits these into Principal (PT) and yield (YT) tokens. These PT and YT tokens are then bought and sold on the Pendle AMM, with Arbitrum end users primarily leveraging their PT positions or holding YT for yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the impact analysis will focus on the effects of the incentives on the growth of the supply of yield-bearing assets available for trading (the supply side), the growth in the trading of Pendle yield tokens (trading activity), and the growth of ecosystem TVL.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of Pendle’s incentives is thoroughly examined across various dimensions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How did the incentives affect the supply of yield-bearing assets by LPs?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did the incentives affect trading activity on the Pendle AMM?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Did they attract new users?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect retention?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect the average volume per user?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did incentives affect the ecosystem growth of Pendle tokens?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of the incentives is also analyzed to gain insight into the structural efficiency of this program.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"liquidity-provider-reactions-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquidity-provider-reactions-13\"></a>Liquidity Provider Reactions</h2>\n<p>Liquidity from AMM LPs on Pendle grew from $52 million to $723 million over the STIP period. Most of this growth occurred between February and March 2024, driven by points programs on Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) that were ideally suited to Pendle’s products. The increase in LRT TVL during this period was clearly due to the demand for Pendle’s offerings, although this growth on Arbitrum was positively affected by the STIP use.</p>\n<p>Pendle’s focus on Arbitrum during this time, enhanced by STIP incentives, brought significant LRT TVL to Arbitrum and added considerable value to the chain. Without these incentives, LRT strategies on Pendle Arbitrum would have been less attractive, and the supply may not have grown as it did. It is also important to highlight how the attention flywheel established Arbitrum as a prominent hub for leveraged LRT strategies, with the incentives having a highly asymmetric effect on its success.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xv2DDOkfOfXXLlEyXl8txLNT5Bv.png?dl=1\" title=\"Total Pendle LP Supply\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_690x429.png\" alt=\"Total Pendle LP Supply\" data-base62-sha1=\"xv2DDOkfOfXXLlEyXl8txLNT5Bv\" width=\"690\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_690x429.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_1035x643.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/eaca0f5487ee65637a69ec898a90eba59d018c61_2_1380x858.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"192632\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The aggressive growth observed after the launch of LRTs overshadows the performance during the first three months of the STIP. Focusing on the period from July 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, a clear trend emerges with LP supply increasing from $52 million to $116 million by the end of January. Most of this growth occurred within the first six weeks of the STIP, before the launch of ecosystem incentives. It remains unclear whether these alternative avenues for accessing STIP rewards competed with LP supplies or if an equilibrium was reached between demand and supply, making the timing coincidental.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1hGuOpRJX8kjTIvRfzUWhhXzoNN.png?dl=1\" title=\"LP Supply up to the end of January 2024.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_690x421.png\" alt=\"LP Supply up to the end of January 2024.\" data-base62-sha1=\"1hGuOpRJX8kjTIvRfzUWhhXzoNN\" width=\"690\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_690x421.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_1035x631.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0901f5d100542bb045b31db327cb8b45efd6c727_2_1380x842.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"15334F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"trading-activity-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trading-activity-14\"></a>Trading Activity</h2>\n<p>These metrics focus on Pendle’s AMM activity.

I found myself in this unfortunate situation after being lured in by the false promises of a platform called <a href=\"http://vipfx.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vipfx.com</a>, which claimed to offer substantial returns on Bitcoin investments. Introduced to this platform by a friend, I naively trusted their recommendations without conducting thorough research, leading to a substantial loss of funds and a prolonged period of despair. Fortunately, my fortunes took a positive turn when I was introduced to Cyber Constable Intelligence, a reputable company specializing in recovering assets lost to financial fraud. With the expert assistance of their team, I was able to navigate the complex process of reclaiming my stolen Bitcoin with remarkable efficiency and success. The support and guidance provided by Cyber Constable Intelligence were attentive, compassionate, and dedicated to helping me recover my bitcoins. One aspect that stood out during my experience with Cyber Constable Intelligence was their swift and effective handling of my case. Within a short span of two weeks, they managed to successfully retrieve my stolen BTC from the perpetrators behind the <a href=\"http://vipfx.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vipfx.com</a> scam. Their prompt action to deliver results without unnecessary delays or complications was truly commendable.

During this period, we will deliver strategic proposals, guide key partners through the DAO processes, and align the priorities of essential stakeholders for the betterment of Arbitrum. We will also expand our efforts to include a small set of additional verticals by hiring skilled contributors in areas where the DAO needs support, such as data analytics, technical proposal creation, marketing, or any other needs that may arise.</p>\n<p>With a budget of $2.791M for the year paid in monthly installments and stored with the Foundation for DAO-clawback capabilities, along with an optional up to 1.5 million ARB for performance-based bonuses voted on by the DAO near the end of the term and put in a 3-year vesting contact to ensure long-term alignment, we will continue to build a dedicated team focused solely on enhancing the Arbitrum DAO’s success. The primary goal of our work is to help Arbitrum DAO continue its path toward efficient and effective operations and execute its long-term vision of becoming a sustainable entity with diversified revenue streams. We believe that over the coming years, Arbitrum DAO has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year while maintaining its status as the leading Ethereum scaling solution with an ever-growing base of users and developers. All of Entropy Advisors’ employees will work full-time towards achieving this goal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-and-rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-and-rationale-4\"></a>Motivation and Rationale</h1>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO is set up to prosper with its cutting-edge technology stack that will soon support numerous coding languages, a vibrant community of users and developers, abundant resources in the DAO treasury, and the ecosystem’s commitment to scaling the most decentralized and secure L2 on Ethereum. Despite our belief that Arbitrum holds a strong position in the market today, there is a lot of work to be done over the next 3-5 years to ensure Arbitrum maintains and advances its position. We have diagnosed some key areas in need of improvement that we feel well suited to take on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Designing, drafting and executing proposals that benefit Arbitrum.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Strengthening overall governance processes and providing feedback to other DAO contributors, unlocking efficiencies and ensuring redundant work is avoided.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Acting as a mesh layer between key stakeholders, e.g., active delegates, development teams such as Offchain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Helping potential 3rd party strategic partners navigate the DAO to attract high-quality companies and individuals within the ecosystem and RFP applicant pools.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Attracting/retaining top talent working full-time, professionally on behalf of Arbitrum DAO.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Improving the ability of the DAO to spend money effectively and support a long term sustainable future for Arbitrum.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Today the Arbitrum DAO faces friction executing across all of the aforementioned tasks. Many times those creating proposals have known or unknown ulterior motives and incentives at play. It is difficult for aspiring contributors and partners to navigate the DAO. No one is incentivized to bolster RFP applicant pools. Communication is fragmented with no entity in place to tie perspectives together, and operations/goals often overlap across initiatives. There are numerous proposals that are consensus to move forward but do not progress because there is no financial incentive to do so. There is inadequate accountability over and transparency into DAO funded programs. The problems are ever-evolving and growing, and the Arbitrum DAO needs an entity that only has the DAO’s best interests in mind to fill the gaps.</p>\n<p>Our team (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/swmartin19\">@swmartin19</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/mattonchain\">@mattonchain</a>, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/pruitt\">@pruitt</a>) brings an extensive network as well as experience in research, governance, brand building, and project management to the Arbitrum DAO, having led well-known brands in the space such as Blockworks Research and 404 DAO. We have all been involved in the DAO since the beginning, starting with Blockworks Research’s entry into the DAO by <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-1-arbitrum-improvement-proposal-framework/30/91\">highlighting flaws</a> in the DAO’s very first proposal, AIP-1. We are not afraid to push against the status quo if we believe it helps Arbitrum achieve its goals.</p>\n<p>Entropy Advisors was extremely fortunate to receive a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation. As such, we have been able to use the past few months contributing full-time to Arbitrum DAO to further showcase our value in the community. We have hosted bi-weekly 1-on-1 calls with a cohort of large delegates, with the foundation, and with OCL, and feel that we have a strong hold on various stakeholder’s interests, strategic goals for Arbitrum, working initiatives, etc. When paired with our experience and networks within the industry, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help Arbitrum achieve its long-term goals with all stakeholder perspectives in mind. With exclusivity meaning no official or unofficial engagements with any other client, Entropy Advisors can serve Arbitrum DAO with no ulterior motives or conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>Today, virtually no money is spent on operations, while the DAO has spent almost 435M ARB in total with ~95% going towards investments, incentives, and grants (Source: Delphi &amp; R3gen). We believe it is absolutely imperative for the DAO to make an investment in operations, simultaneously ensuring different initiatives across the ecosystem can be set in motion swiftly, fit together seamlessly, and can reach the best talent, while the DAO’s expenditures can be managed in a way that enables long-term sustainability. It is evident that this is becoming a wider-reaching theme within the DAO, but requires a heavy lift (see <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737\">OpCo</a> proposal from <span class=\"mention\">@dkpremia</span> that asks for 25M ARB). We are NOT looking to replace OpCo, but rather drastically reduce the scope and funding request by helping formulate operational procedures until the OpCo is formally stood up. At that point, the DAO can decide what role Entropy Advisors plays as a service provider to the OpCo.</p>\n<p>With the budget as outlined, Entropy will be able to hire up to 10 employees with a diverse range of skill sets including governance, data analytics, marketing, and development/engineering. We will be able to hire top talent in our industry who will dedicate their full-time bandwidth to Arbitrum DAO. Regardless of Arbitrum’s current strategic priorities, whether cutting costs or scaling strategies, our team will work to execute the goals of the DAO. Given Arbitrum’s dominance, size, and number of initiatives it is important that we build a well-rounded team at Entropy that can operate as the tip of the spear as a catalyst for change across the many sectors that the DAO operates.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"entropys-portfolio-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#entropys-portfolio-5\"></a>Entropy’s Portfolio</h1>\n<p>At the beginning of May, we <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-print-hello-world/23675/9\">introduced</a> Entropy Advisors to the Arbitrum DAO.

This has helped ensure no two entities are working on the same thing in silos and will become more important in the future as we define the DAO’s long-term strategic vision.</li>\n<li>By leveraging our existing network, we have kicked off discussions with potential major partners for the DAO.

The partnership will begin on the first of the month after this proposal passes. During this time, Entropy will service no other clients in any capacity. We will achieve the aforementioned goals through the following deliverables:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"proposals-as-a-service-paas-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposals-as-a-service-paas-7\"></a><strong>Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Neutral Proposal Broker\n<ul>\n<li>Hold introductory strategy meetings with key Arbitrum stakeholders and partners to help them navigate the DAO.

This involved acting as a neutral party to broker proposals, aligning stakeholders, attracting talent, and improving strategic partner onboarding and stakeholder relations. Our initial efforts have already demonstrated notable progress in a short time period, setting the stage for a more capable DAO.</p>\n<p>During Phase 1 we identified how Entropy fits into the broader DAO, and how we can be most useful. This involved lessons learned in passing proposals, project management, and working with new and existing partners. Additionally, we took this time to start building relationships with all of the DAO’s most active stakeholders including many delegates, members of the foundation, protocol teams, and key individuals at Offchain Labs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"this-proposal-phase-2-passing-a-dao-proposal-for-one-year-of-continued-work-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#this-proposal-phase-2-passing-a-dao-proposal-for-one-year-of-continued-work-11\"></a>[This Proposal] Phase 2: Passing a DAO Proposal For One Year of Continued Work.</h3>\n<p>Over the next year, we will build on the foundations we have established, aiming to make the Arbitrum DAO an efficient and effective community dedicated to long-term sustainability through the points brought up in the Motivation &amp; Rationale section.</p>\n<p>We will enhance governance processes by ensuring the initiatives we develop and implement focus on accountability. By fostering stronger relationships between key stakeholders we will ensure more cohesive collaboration. Through data, quantitative, and qualitative analysis we will begin to analyze active initiatives and propose clawbacks and other mechanisms to decrease DAO spend to focus its budget on high ROI initiatives.</p>\n<p>Leveraging our extensive network, we will secure partnerships that bring value to the DAO, enhancing the overall ecosystem. Additionally, we will pick up small lift brand and marketing campaigns to help bring awareness to DAO initiatives. We will continue to attract and retain high-quality contributors by offering competitive compensation, professional development opportunities, and a collaborative work environment.</p>\n<p>Through strategic projects, such as well-thought-out economic stimulation, we will support the DAO in generating sustainable revenue streams. Our proposal includes an agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation so that if the OpCo is stood up in the next year, we can easily port our agreement to fall under its purview instead of the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"phase-3-a-well-oiled-machine-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#phase-3-a-well-oiled-machine-12\"></a>Phase 3: A Well-Oiled Machine</h3>\n<p>In Phase 3, we envision Entropy Advisors as a well-oiled machine, seamlessly servicing the Arbitrum DAO. Entropy will grow together with the ecosystem, continuing to perfect the deliverables mentioned earlier while looking for areas where we can add value. By this stage, we will have employed and retained top talent, creating an environment where the DAO operates at peak efficiency. Our efforts will help position Arbitrum as the clear-cut leader in the rollup ecosystem, driving innovation, growth, and success.</p>\n<p>At this point OpCo should be well underway and Entropy Advisors will continue to serve as a service provider to OpCo, if viewed as beneficial. The DAO will be able to retain a second year of Entropy’s services under the same terms stipulated in this proposal, if it desires to do so. For this second-year engagement clause to be executed in the future, the DAO will also need to vote in favor of the future bonus proposal discussed below. If the OpCo is stood up, this entity can be responsible for the potential renewal in place of a DAO vote. This structure would come into effect at the end of our initial 1-year term.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"cost-budget-breakdown-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#cost-budget-breakdown-13\"></a>Cost &amp; Budget Breakdown</h1>\n<p><strong>Salaries: $1.96M</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: According to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGkU4uF_Lz5Y_qiOaimLAVxYdy9JfEn3DfIraJCUY0E/edit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Delphi</a>, a VC analyst (the lowest level employee) makes $85,000-$160,000 + a carry with more senior positions making significantly more. Employees cost an employer substantially more than base salary due to benefits, taxes, and other assorted costs. This ensures competitive compensation to attract and retain top talent, with our goal being to hire up to 10 employees. Additionally, we will be able to hire independent contractors and service providers on a project-by-project basis as needed. We are doing highly specialized work, and obtaining experienced individuals in the middle of a bull market with extensive experience in operations, project management, finance, and governance that are also crypto native will be expensive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Legal, Insurance, and Accounting: $90K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Covers necessary legal, insurance, and accounting services to ensure compliance and protect the organization. As a company operating in a forward-facing role in the governance space, a sufficient budget is necessary to protect against changing tides in the regulatory environment. Costs include setting up a Cayman Entity, D&amp;O + E&amp;O insurance, accountant’s hours, ESOP, employee agreement reviews, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conference Travel, Offsites, and Small Events: $105K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: It is important that Entropy represent Arbitrum DAO at industry leading events. Hosting our own small events is important for brand building. Offsites and conferences can cost as much as $5,000 per employee in attendance. Even throwing a small “Happy Hour” type event can cost between $5,000 and $15,000. This enables Entropy members to attend industry conferences, conduct 1-2 offsites per year, and host 1-2 small events to foster team collaboration and engagement with the community. All while representing Arbitrum DAO in a professional manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Assorted Software: $21K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Enterprise Dune, Gusto, QuickBooks, Replit, Google Suite, Web Hosting, Laevitas, Token Terminal, Open AI API, Slack, etc. Provides essential tools and platforms for data analysis, development, operations, and communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Brand and Marketing: $80K</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Justification: Invests in brand building and marketing efforts to enhance the visibility and reach of the Arbitrum DAO. Though it is a small budget and the DAO should still explore other avenues for marketing, it will allow us to do the bare minimum of promoting Twitter/X threads, building websites, and other brand building mechanisms of this nature. Launching a high-quality podcast can also incur significant costs.

Any Excess ARB not monetized (or stored for the potential bonus below) and excess stables from lower payments during the initial scaling of Entropy will be sent back to the DAO by the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"termination-and-clawback-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#termination-and-clawback-16\"></a>Termination and Clawback</h3>\n<p>The DAO may vote via Snapshot to terminate Arbitrum’s relationship with Entropy Advisors at any time. Quorum for this proposal will be set at the same level as ongoing non-constitutional onchain proposals, with quorum defined as total votes for termination+abstention, and the proposal must have more voting power in favor of termination than against or abstaining. If the Snapshot proposal passes, the DAO can terminate the agreement with Entropy Advisors, effective on the last day of the month in which the Snapshot passes, effectively stopping any future payment at that moment. In this scenario, all funds earmarked for Entropy Advisors will be returned to the DAO by the Foundation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-15m-arb-bonus-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-15m-arb-bonus-17\"></a>1.5M ARB Bonus</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will hold 1.5 million ARB allocated to potential performance bonuses. As the 1-year period comes to a close, Entropy will post a Snapshot vote so that the DAO may decide if the bonus should be distributed. The DAO will have the options of no bonus, 500k ARB bonus, 1M ARB bonus, or full 1.5M ARB allocation. If the proposal passes, the Foundation will send the X (TBD number) ARB to a 3-year vesting smart contract that pays out to Entropy Advisors in monthly streams. This ensures Entropy Advisors remains aligned with the DAO and ARB token even after this agreement has expired and as we move into Phase 3 and onward.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"return-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#return-18\"></a>Return</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will send all funds in excess of – $2,791,000 + 1.5 million ARB – back to the DAO. At the end of the year, any additional dollars resulting from months where Entropy receives $100,000 instead of the full allocation, and remainder from 1.5M ARB if the full bonus is not allocated, will also be returned.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"our-vision-is-to-turn-arbitrum-into-a-sustainable-entity-with-durable-operations-in-place-entropy-will-be-the-spearhead-of-catalyzing-operational-change-and-leave-long-lasting-structure-in-its-wake-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#our-vision-is-to-turn-arbitrum-into-a-sustainable-entity-with-durable-operations-in-place-entropy-will-be-the-spearhead-of-catalyzing-operational-change-and-leave-long-lasting-structure-in-its-wake-19\"></a>Our vision is to turn Arbitrum into a sustainable entity with durable operations in place.

This is on purpose:</p>\n<p>As highlighted in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-gains-network-stip-addendum/23398/1\">Addendum</a>, Gains Network will utilize a large part of its LP incentives budget to bootstrap more (sticky) liquidity for the <a href=\"https://gains.trade/vaults/gUSDC\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gUSDC</a> vault as it’s anticipating more USDC-collateral usage over the coming months. Initially, the focus will be on building liquidity on third-party DEXs for gUSDC/USDC pools. This strategy aims to unlock various partnership opportunities, creating an ecosystem around gUSDC through lending markets, LP-strategy protocols, and more.</p>\n<p>Once the necessary requirements for these DEX pools are met and gUSDC price feeds are established, there will be potential for new partnerships. These new pools and contracts will be incentivized using the current surplus.

Consequently, Radiant will adjust the incentive distribution from an 80-20 split to a 75-25 split between lenders and borrowers. This adjustment should enhance borrowing incentives without penalizing or discouraging deposits.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Radpie wstETH vault (104,166 ARB)</strong></p>\n<p>The wstETH market incentives have been running for the past week, initially supported solely by Radiant’s incentives. Thanks to an upcoming collaboration with Lido, who will match Radiant’s incentives for the market, Radiant expects a substantial increase in market participation.</p>\n<p>This wstETH initiative is carried out on Radpie due to its unique ability to create vaults with automatic 3.46x looping, which was desired by Lido to co-incentivize the market.</p>\n<p>Since the introduction of these incentives, there has been a clear increase in TVL, bolstering our confidence that the market will perform exceptionally well once the total planned incentives from both Radiant and Lido are in full effect.

Radpie USDC lenders (120,000 ARB)</strong></p>\n<p>The recent bull market has led to Radiant users choosing to de-prioritize holding stablecoins such as USDC, preferring leverage and volatile assets. This stance has led to a decrease in USDC lenders, causing USDC borrow rates to spike.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the need to stabilize these rates, Radiant is prioritizing efforts to enhance the native USDC market, in alignment with the goals of Arbitrum, Gauntlet, and Circle to foster greater adoption of this asset.</p>\n<p>This effort is being carried out through Radpie, leveraging previous STIP initiatives that incentivized stablecoin pools and yielded favorable outcomes. The initiative has already shown outstanding results within the first two days, with an initial TVL of 2.9M growing to 5.3M, reflecting an 82.75% increase. These promising outcomes reinforce Radiant’s confidence in enhancing market stability and promoting broader adoption of native USDC on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1atxDO6VkhzSn0Zo2aIrQQ5Svyr.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_690x449.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"1atxDO6VkhzSn0Zo2aIrQQ5Svyr\" width=\"690\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_690x449.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_1035x673.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_1380x898.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"98E8FB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>5.

The structure of the STIP Bridge incentive program is very different than the original STIP grant.</p>\n<p>30% of the STIP B grant will be given as incentives to LPs by the same mechanism as the STIP. This time around though, we will be focusing liquidity incentives on a smaller number of tokens.</p>\n<p>70% of the STIP B grant will be given to other kinds of users on Notional through the use of an off-chain points program. Total ARB incentives distributed through the points program will be 175,000 ARB over three 4-week seasons.

We felt that this was impractical and have instead decided to focus on leveraged vault users and borrowers as we have found those users to be the most important in driving growth. Depending on the results in Season One, we may tweak point multipliers for the next season to respond to any issues we see in Season One.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1

The motivation to implement FCFS was twofold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Easy to understand and implement,</li>\n<li>Replicate Web2 user experience for instant transaction confirmation,</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unfortunately, relying solely on first-come first-served transaction ordering is not an ideal long-term solution.</p>\n<p>When opportunities to profitably arbitrage across exchanges arise on Arbitrum, “MEV Searchers” race to get their transaction included before anyone else so that they can capture this profit. This latency race involves a lot of spam, placing stress on chain infrastructure and causing searchers to wastefully invest in faster hardware. Furthermore, none of the MEV generated is captured by the chain and instead all profits are collected by searchers.</p>\n<p>Timeboost is a new transaction ordering policy that retains many of the great benefits currently in place for Arbitrum chains, including frontrunning protection and fast block times, while allowing the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p><strong>Sustainable</strong>: Timeboost offers the ArbitrumDAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users, since the value being captured already exists.</p>\n<p><strong>Technically-Inclusive</strong>: Rather than capturing arbitrage opportunities by having the fastest hardware, participants can win these opportunities by bidding in an auction.</p>\n<p><strong>Neutral and Open</strong>: The auction for the express lane is permissionless and participation is open to everyone, where the highest bid wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Empowerment</strong>: The Arbitrum DAO can configure all aspects of Timeboost, including enabling or disabling it, the auction’s design, and how to handle proceeds.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<p><strong>Express Lane</strong>: A separate path for submitting transactions to the sequencer that has priority access compared to normally submitted transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>MEV</strong>: Maximal extractible value. In the context of Timeboost, MEV refers to the maximum amount of profit someone could make by including their transactions slightly faster than anyone else.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The full specification for the Timeboost auction can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/timeboost-design</a></p>\n<p>Arbitrum chains that adopt Timeboost will have two paths for transaction submission:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Normal path</strong>: Transactions in the normal path will experience a short delay (defaulted to 200ms) but will otherwise remain unchanged.</li>\n<li><strong>Express lane</strong>: Transactions in the express lane do not experience any delay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Access to the express lane would be auctioned off in one-minute rounds, with the auction happening 15 seconds before the round begins. Bids are kept private until after the bid submission deadline, and the auction winner will pay the same price as the second-highest bid of that round. There are two main components that facilitate the express lane auction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Auction contract</strong>: Prospective bidders must deposit funds into the auction contract before bidding in the auction. The contract is also responsible for verifying bidders’ signatures, checking auction contract account balances, deducting the second-highest bid amount from the account of the highest bidder, and handling the proceeds.</li>\n<li><strong>Autonomous auctioneer</strong>: An offchain program that captures bids from participants and reports the top two bids to the auction contract. This AIP proposes that the sequencer act as the autonomous auctioneer if Timeboost is adopted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed version of Timeboost is compatible with a centralized sequencer, however, the Timeboost policy will be compatible with proposals for a decentralized sequencer. 3% of auction proceeds would be left aside for the Arbitrum Developer Guild, which helps fund core Arbitrum development.</p>\n<p>The ArbitrumDAO can configure the currency in which bids are collected and how the auction proceeds are handled. This AIP proposes two main options that the community can vote on if it decides to adopt Timeboost. Governance can change these options at any time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Collect ETH</strong>: Collect bids in ETH and send the proceeds to the DAO treasury.</li>\n<li><strong>Burn ARB</strong>: Collect bids in ARB and burn the proceeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on which option the Arbitrum DAO chooses, the auction contract can either transfer the proceeds to a designated account or burn them.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-6\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discussion of the proposal on the forum and governance call(s)</li>\n<li>A vote on Snapshot to decide between Option 1 (collect ETH), Option 2 (burn ARB), or Option 3 (don’t adopt Timeboost)</li>\n<li>Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet</li>\n<li>An onchain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>20 posts - 18 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Jun 2024 02:49:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25167"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167.rss","#text":"Constitutional AIP: Proposal to adopt Timeboost, a new transaction ordering policy"},"filter":false},{"title":"What is Next for Blockchain Gaming in 2024? Discover the Latest Trends!","dc:creator":"Alishmartin","category":"General","description":"<p>Discover the latest trends shaping this innovative space, from enhanced play-to-earn models to the rise of decentralized gaming platforms. Explore how these developments are transforming the gaming landscape and offering new opportunities for both players and developers.

Content Creation Fellowship has been hard at work for the past nine weeks, and we’re excited to share our progress and our vision for the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Shifting Focus to Empower the DAO:</strong></p>\n<p>We initially explored a wide range of ideas, from hackathon coordination to builder camps. For deciding which one to pursue we looked for the Arbitrum guidelines or any sort of North Star. However, we found out that aside clear technical topics like Stylus, there was no agreed goal beyond the Community Values. From asking around different contributors and looking into education and content proposals we identified the process has been carried out as an experiment without a set of goals and criteria to measure progress against.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we recognized that our most impactful contribution would be to empower the DAO with a deep understanding of its specific needs in Education and Content Creation. To achieve this, we’re developing a comprehensive, data-driven research initiative to ensure our work aligns perfectly with the DAO’s goals and priorities.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Goals:</strong></p>\n<p>Our research focuses on the ongoing Questbook round named Arbitrum Education, Community Growth, and Events Domain. Answering the following three key questions will allow the DAO and the grant operators to optimize its budget allocation so to accelerate growth of those projects that add to the financial sustainability for the long-term health of the Arbitrum ecosystem, and enable both social and technical inclusivity:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the most pressing educational needs of the Arbitrum DAO?</li>\n<li>What common metrics have been achieved by approved projects in the “Arbitrum Education, Community Growth, and Events” category on Questbook?</li>\n<li>How do these metrics align with Arbitrum’s DAO Community Values and the identified pressing needs?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Research Approach:</strong></p>\n<p>To gather this essential information, we’ll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct a targeted survey of delegates, Arbitrum Foundation collaborators, and ARB token holders.</li>\n<li>Thoroughly analyze the descriptions, milestones, and metrics of approved projects.</li>\n<li>Engage in in-depth interviews with key stakeholders to gain valuable insights.</li>\n<li>Leverage innovative tools, such as Farcaster frames, to gather survey data linked to wallets involved in the DAO, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of our research.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Value We Bring to the DAO:</strong></p>\n<p>Our research will equip the DAO with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A crystal-clear understanding of the community’s educational priorities.</li>\n<li>Data-driven insights into the effectiveness of past initiatives.</li>\n<li>Actionable recommendations to guide future funding decisions and maximize impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re finalizing our research proposal and will be applying for funding through Questbook by June 29th.</li>\n<li>We’re committed to transparent communication and will share regular updates on our progress, actively seeking your feedback throughout the research process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We Value Your Input!</strong></p>\n<p>We invite you to share your thoughts, suggestions, and any questions you have about this initiative.

Additionally, GG20 was supercharged with strategic rewards and impact assessment via Thrive Protocol, offering builders, promoters, curators, and program managers reward opportunities for contributions that boosted community engagement in the round, attracted top talent to the Arbitrum ecosystem, and generally promoted wider adoption of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The donation phase closed on May 7th. GG20 achieved its immediate goals by allocating and distributing 100k across both Open Source Software and community rounds and budgeting an additional 100k for impact-based incentives. It facilitated over 35,000 addresses transacting on Arbitrum, resulting in more than $2 million in total transactions, including matching funds from Gitcoin. Additionally, the number of open-source projects doubled, and Arbitrum was highlighted as the default network for all grant rounds, with Gitcoin committing to continue this partnership through 2024. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/muscle.png?v=12\" title=\":muscle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":muscle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"firestarters-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#firestarters-6\"></a>Firestarters</h3>\n<p>The second program funded by our pluralist grants program is the Firestarters program.

We also published a call <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thank-arb-program-update-assessors-needed/24511\">to Arbitrum community members to become part of our team of reviewers</a> as we progressively decentralize our pluralistic grants program.</p>\n<p>The first project selected for funding through the Firestarters program is <a href=\"http://www.shefi.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SheFi</a>, which is led by Maggie Love and empowers professional women and non-binary folks to reinvent their careers in Web3. It’s 8 weeks of immersive instruction, hands-on demos, onchain quests, and peer support aimed at mastering Web3. Together with the Arbitrum Foundation, Thank ARB is sponsoring Season 11 of SheFi, which aims to increase knowledge and adoption of Arbitrum’s Layer 2 solutions, enhance community diversity, and contribute to Arbitrum governance.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-2-oversight-board-milestone-delivery-tracking-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-oversight-board-milestone-delivery-tracking-7\"></a>2.
