This extension will run from September 9th to November 6th, 2024, aligning the deployment of the remaining grant funds with a major product launch.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum community should implement this extension to maximize the impact of the originally approved grant, which targeted LP &amp; stablecoin incentives. By aligning the distribution with the launch of our Arbitrum-exclusive Multi-Collateral Perps feature, we can ensure greater engagement, trading volume, and overall ecosystem growth.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Synthetix has experienced unforeseen delays in its deployment of Synthetix Perps on Arbitrum. We originally expected to launch by late July, to align with one month of Perps fee rebates. However, due to audits and other factors, and to ensure the top performance of our Arbitrum-exclusive multi-collateral perps feature, we’ve been unable to hit these targets. As a result, we’ve not utilized 900k ARB from our proposal and would like to seek an extension.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-key-terms-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-key-terms-5\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Multi-Collateral Perps</strong></strong> : A feature allowing users to margin with ETH, BTC, and USDx for perpetual futures trading on Arbitrum with Synthetix Perps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The extension will utilize the remaining 900k ARB tokens from our original proposal for trading fee rebates. These rebates will be distributed over 8 weeks, coinciding with the launch of Multi-Collateral Perps. This approach ensures:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Full implementation of the Multi-Collateral Perps feature</li>\n<li>Complete integration with frontend partners, particularly Kwenta as our launch partner</li>\n<li>Enhanced capital efficiency with multiple margin options, new trading strategies, trading types, etc.</li>\n<li>Improved user experience and market competitiveness as an Arbitrum exclusive launch</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-steps-to-implement-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-steps-to-implement-7\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Launch Multi-Collateral Perps feature on Arbitrum (this week)</li>\n<li>Begin distribution of trading fee rebates</li>\n<li>Monitor and report on the impact of the rebates and new feature</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-timeline-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-timeline-8\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Start Date: September [TBD] based on Snapshot vote timing</li>\n<li>End Date: November [TBD] based on Snapshot vote timing</li>\n<li>Total 8 week program from starting date.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-overall-cost-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-overall-cost-9\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p>The extension utilizes the remaining 900,000 ARB tokens from the originally approved 2 million ARB grant.

However, over time, the protocol’s most prominent and consistent use has been as the underlying infrastructure for the “Hyperliquid” app—a platform that demands high throughput and seamless liquidity management.</p>\n<p>Given this focused application, the proposed name “HyperLiquid Bridge” (HLB) is a direct reflection of Arbitrum’s role in the ecosystem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hyper:</strong> Denoting the protocol’s ability to support Hyperliquid’s high-speed, high-volume transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquid:</strong> Emphasizing its role in ensuring fluid liquidity movement essential for Hyperliquid’s operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Bridge:</strong> Highlighting its function in connecting Hyperliquid to the broader blockchain network, facilitating interoperability and scalability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Focused Identity:</strong> Renaming the protocol to HLB underscores its primary function in serving the Hyperliquid app. This brings a clearer and more focused identity, distinguishing it from other Layer 2 solutions by associating it directly with its most significant application.</li>\n<li><strong>Brand Alignment:</strong> The name HLB aligns the protocol’s branding with its main use case, strengthening its association with the Hyperliquid app and providing a cohesive narrative for users and stakeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Market Positioning:</strong> By naming the protocol after its most prominent application, the new branding helps position HLB as the definitive infrastructure for Hyperliquid, rather than a generic Layer 2 solution. This distinction will solidify its reputation within the specific niche it serves.</li>\n<li><strong>Efficiency in Communication:</strong> For developers, partners, and users, the HLB name simplifies communication by making the connection between the protocol and its primary application explicit, reducing any ambiguity about its main purpose.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Implementation Plan:</strong> The transition from “Arbitrum” to “HLB” will be carefully managed to ensure a seamless experience for the Hyperliquid app and its users. Key steps include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Involve the Hyperliquid community in the renaming process to gather feedback and ensure broad support for the change.</li>\n<li><strong>Brand Rollout:</strong> Update all branding, including the protocol’s website, technical documentation, and communication channels, to reflect the HLB name.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical Updates:</strong> Ensure all technical documentation, APIs, and SDKs are updated to align with the new name, and work closely with the Hyperliquid team to coordinate this transition.</li>\n<li><strong>Partner Coordination:</strong> Communicate the change to partners and integrated platforms, focusing on those directly involved with the Hyperliquid app to ensure continuity and compatibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Renaming the Arbitrum protocol to HLB (HyperLiquid Bridge) is a strategic decision that aligns the protocol’s identity with its predominant use case, the Hyperliquid app. This change will clarify its role in the ecosystem, streamline communication, and reinforce its market position as the infrastructure behind Hyperliquid.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-low-cost-enhancement-to-hyperliquid-integration/26521\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-low-cost-enhancement-to-hyperliquid-integration/26521","pubDate":"Tue, 27 Aug 2024 17:01:00 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26521"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-low-cost-enhancement-to-hyperliquid-integration/26521.rss","#text":"Proposal: Low-cost Enhancement to HyperLiquid Integration"},"filter":false},{"title":"Gains Network Bi-Weekly Update [26-08-2024]","dc:creator":"clJoseph","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-57364-recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57364-recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p><strong>ARB Received Last Disbursement:</strong> 375,000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks:</strong> 327,273 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trading Incentives (163,636 ARB per Epoch):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>gTrade Trading Incentives:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>****<a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7401374ce116b71abd1e2ae6351d21c2296d8787\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EpochBasedTokenClaim | Address 0x7401374ce116b71abd1e2ae6351d21c2296d8787 | Arbitrum One</a></p>\n<p><strong>LP Incentives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Merkle Incentives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GNS/ETH on Camelot</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9b6FF025AeE245D314c09F57B72f0dE6E231c3a6\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AlgebraPool | Address 0x9b6FF025AeE245D314c09F57B72f0dE6E231c3a6 | Arbitrum One</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>gUSDC / USDC on Camelot</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3ef3d8ba38ebe18db133cec108f4d14ce00dd9ae#tokentxns\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/03140f11ed4113f8feff09d11818c8ab7939dbeb.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"6C8DA7\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3ef3d8ba38ebe18db133cec108f4d14ce00dd9ae#tokentxns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum L2 Explorer</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/345;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71af28613f12b34fa3525e9c71dbadd513869f9e_2_690x345.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F8F9\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3ef3d8ba38ebe18db133cec108f4d14ce00dd9ae#tokentxns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Angle Protocol: Distributor | Address...</a></h3>\n\n  <p>The Contract Address 0x3ef3d8ba38ebe18db133cec108f4d14ce00dd9ae page allows users to view the source code, transactions, balances, and analytics for the contract address.

From the DAO’s standpoint, yield-bearing assets are crucial for sustaining long-term TVL for both Balancer and Arbitrum. Liquidity providers benefit greatly from the various ways capital efficiency is encompassed by Balancers various unique pooling solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives:</strong> Balancer’s ARB incentive strategy focuses on directing BAL to existing gauges on Arbitrum, thereby boosting the highest-yielding pools for liquidity providers in terms of returns and fees. By leveraging Balancer’s core pool mechanisms and the STIP Addendum boost settings, this approach aims to create a thriving and sustainable environment for the most beneficial asset classes on Arbitrum within Balancer. The goal is to optimize the capital efficiency of ARB incentives for both the Arbitrum ecosystem and the Balancer DAO.

This adjustment leverages Balancer’s expertise in yield-bearing strategies, enabling us to concentrate on the pools that will provide the greatest benefit to our liquidity providers and participants in the Arbitrum ecosystem.

So far, we have received around 29 applications and have accepted approximately 9 of them. <em>We will be making upfront payments to the newly accepted grantees, with further disbursements depending on the achievement of</em> <em>KPI milestones.</em></p>\n<p>We closed down our grants program on June 24th.

This renewal will include adjustments to the parameters, requirements, budget, and incentives awarded to delegates.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57276-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57276-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>We’ve reached the<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-incentive-program-results-july-2024/26098\"> fifth month of the current version</a> of the incentive program, which ends on August 31.</p>\n<p>As outlined in the<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives/25671\"> mid-term report</a>, the program has positively impacted ArbitrumDAO during the first three months.</p>\n<p>However, simply renewing the program will not generate enough value. Therefore, we propose adjustments to improve the program and increase its impact on ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p>These changes are based on our experience as administrators, the reports we’ve conducted, and feedback from delegates, the Karma team, and key community members.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>As mentioned in the initial proposal, SEEDGov will deliver an end-term report once the six-month period is complete.</em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57276-strengthening-dips-mission-vision-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57276-strengthening-dips-mission-vision-4\"></a>Strengthening DIP’s Mission &amp; Vision</h1>\n<p>As we mentioned in the<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/response-to-arbitrum-staking-proposal-ardc-research-deliverable/26048\"> report</a>, it is crucial to keep delegated voting power active within ArbitrumDAO. We believe the Incentive Program should focus on the professionalization of delegates.</p>\n<p>By professionalization, delegates should dedicate a significant amount of time to staying informed about developments in ArbitrumDAO, gaining knowledge of Arbitrum’s technology, and making meaningful contributions to the DAO. This includes active participation in most DAO activities like providing feedback on proposals, attending to Governance Calls, maintaining high voting participation on Snapshot and Tally, and providing a rationale for such votes.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, we also need to establish transparent and predictable incentives. Delegates should be confident that if they align with the DAO and improve their contributions over time—essentially if they professionalize—they will receive better incentives. These incentives should be transparent and attractive without being subject to manipulation or arbitrary changes in their amount. Delegates should focus on their role and DAO activities, not on understanding complex economic mechanisms to receive compensation.</p>\n<p>We want delegates to be motivated to participate actively in ArbitrumDAO. In order to do this, incentives must be attractive enough for them to either participate directly or hire competent individuals to represent their interests, those of their community, or their protocol.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that while managing the incentive program, we realized that it doesn’t address all the challenges faced by the DAO, such as vote distribution, attracting new contributors, and other aspects. Expecting a single strategy to tackle all issues overlooks the diversity of factors involved. However, we’re pleased to see initiatives like<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084\"> ARB Staking</a>,<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/what-is-re-delegation-week-application-thread/25262/26\"> (Re)delegation Week</a>, and the<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/1\"> Public Good Citizen Enfranchisement Pool</a> are underway to address these challenges. As each initiative matures, we can align them to achieve a more significant collective impact.</p>\n<p><em>With that in mind, we propose the following changes to the Delegate Incentive Program</em>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57276-delegate-incentive-program-v11-specs-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57276-delegate-incentive-program-v11-specs-5\"></a>Delegate Incentive Program v1.1: Specs</h1>\n<p>The proposed changes below are based on the experience we’ve gained while managing the program.

To minimize the potential for manipulation, delegates who sign up before the third day of the month will be included in the incentive calculations for that month.

As of the date of this RFC, 53 delegates are enrolled in the program, with an average of 34 receiving incentives. We hope that during the next phase of the program, both the number of enrolled delegates and those receiving compensation for their contributions will continue to grow.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57276-incentive-budget-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57276-incentive-budget-12\"></a>Incentive Budget</h3>\n<p><strong>Budget Allocation: MAX 4,200,000 USD (up to 7.000 USD per delegate per month).</strong></p>\n<p>If we want to professionalize DAO operations as much as possible and stay aligned we should aim for delegates to have a certain seniority and dedication to Bringing Value to Arbitrum DAO. Thus, delegates who meet the requirements at the end of the month and achieve a TP of at least 65% will be eligible to receive up to 7,000 USD in ARB tokens as compensation.</p>\n<p>Now, as program administrators, our goal is to create the necessary incentives to elevate the overall quality of contributions. During the first iteration of the DIP, we observed that the compensation for top delegates did not significantly differ from those with lower Total Participation (TP) scores. To address this, we propose the introduction of three compensation tiers based on the Total Participation Rate achieved by each delegate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> TP between 65% and 70%. Compensation range: $3,000 to $3,250. ARB cap: 8,000.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> TP between 70% and 85%. Compensation range: $4,200 to $5,100. ARB cap: 12,000.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tier 3:</strong> TP between 85% and 100%. Compensation range: $5,950 to $7,000. ARB cap: 16,500.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach makes the program more cost-effective per USD spent because as the quality of contributions increases, more resources are allocated to higher-performing delegates (those in tiers 2 and 3). Conversely, if delegate performance is suboptimal, fewer resources are allocated, with more delegates falling into tiers 1 and 2.</p>\n<p>We considered the volatility of the ARB token by suggesting an ARB cap for each Tier.

As this phase was a trial, we primarily focused on observing certain dynamics within the forum to better understand them and make adjustments for the next iteration.</p>\n<p>One of the issues we identified is the use of AI to comment on proposals. While the use of AI for tasks such as translating text or correcting grammatical errors is understandable, we have seen instances where it has been employed to generate feedback based on other users’ comments. This has not been a widespread or alarming issue but, in the next iteration, we plan to take a more reactive approach.</p>\n<p>Another issue we have encountered is regarding users who post “Reserved for later comment.” We want to clarify that we do not recommend or encourage such practices, which should preferably be avoided.</p>\n<p>In this iteration we will try to provide feedback to delegates on this type of situation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57276-scoring-weight-changes-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57276-scoring-weight-changes-19\"></a>Scoring Weight Changes</h3>\n<p>After observing delegate behavior and some internal discussions, we believe it is necessary to adjust specific parameters of the program:</p>\n<p><strong>Participation Rate (PR)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change</strong>: Previously weighted at 20% and based on historical participation rates in Tally. Now, it is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The 90-day participation rate is a requirement for delegates to register in the program. Unlike the historical rate, this parameter is more accessible, so we have decided to lower its weight.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Snapshot Voting (SV)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change:</strong> The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 20%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Snapshot voting is a crucial part of the governance process. It is essential to give it more weight to encourage delegates to vote in snapshots.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Communicating Rationale (CR)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change:</strong> The weight of this parameter has decreased from 25% to 10%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> While providing a rationale for votes is important, we consider the feedback period even more crucial. Therefore, we have reduced the weight of Communicating Rationale and increased the weight of Commenting Proposals.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Proposal Feedback (PF)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change:</strong> The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 30%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Providing feedback on forum proposals is fundamental. We have raised this parameter’s weight above others and introduced additional changes to incentivize delegates to provide feedback during the early stages of proposals. These changes are detailed further below.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Total Participation (TP)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change:</strong> The requirement for total participation has increased from +60% to +65%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> After analyzing the program’s results, we observed that some delegates with high historical participation in Tally could meet the +60% requirement by voting on 100% of monthly proposals. We have decided to raise the TP requirement to +65% for compensation to encourage more contributions in the forum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bonus Point (BP)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change:</strong> Adding Bonus Points for delegates who attends to the “Arbitrum Open Governance Call” (monthly) and the “Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For the monthly call, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attendance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the bi-weekly calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attending each call.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: We have received several questions about delegate participation in calls or working groups. While there is a trend to compensate work within specific WGs (and we want to avoid potential double spending by the DAO), we find it interesting to experiment with the idea of awarding Bonus Points to delegates who participate in both the “Arbitrum Open Governance Call” (monthly) and the “Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call.” We will continue to manage this parameter as in the previous program. Although it was a topic of discussion, we have yet to receive complaints about how these points were awarded.

This includes regular software maintenance, such as updating libraries and other necessary tasks to keep the system secure and efficient.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ongoing Collaboration with SEEDGov:</strong> Regular calls with the SEEDGov team over the past six months have been instrumental in maintaining the program’s smooth operation. These meetings have allowed us to address bugs, resolve data discrepancies, and implement enhancements based on administrative needs. We will continue these calls to ensure ongoing improvements in operational efficiency.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Compensation Calculation Logic Updates:</strong> As outlined in the new proposal, we will implement necessary changes to the compensation calculation logic. This includes introducing a tier system, adjusting weights and metrics, and incorporating a 90-day calculation period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automation of Voting Statistics:</strong> Our current system fully automates voting statistics, streamlining the process for admins to determine compensation. Collecting data on Communication Rationale and Proposal Feedback has historically been time-consuming. A few months ago, we introduced an MVP that automates this process using LLM tools. We plan to continue enhancing this feature to further assist administrators.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Verification of Statistics:</strong> All statistics need to be verified for accuracy in a timely manner, specifically by the first of each month.

This means that the programme is lightweight in facilitation and organization and that its contents are free to use under creative commons.</p>\n<p>Immersion focusses on activating uninitiated web3 entrepreneurs. The programme gives an elementary introduction to entrepreneurship, letting participants taste what it’s like to venture in the world of web3. Upon completing the programme, participants are able to decide for themselves whether they would like to continue their venturing journey into web3 (or not).</p>\n<p>With this particular angle on activating people to build in web3, Immersion can be employed as a useful addition to other community building initiatives like hackathons and meetups.

The Immersion programme will be designed to be self-facilitating. No (domain nor facilitation) experience is needed to run the content as the authority and learning dynamics is prompted through the content we build.</p>\n<p>Self-facilitating means that after running the Immersion programme together with partnering the university society, it will be equipped to run the next round itself, without dependency on outside facilitation support. This provides the flexibility university societies need in terms of budgetary, organisational and timing constraints to run a programme that gives an easy and effective boost to venture building.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57255-next-steps-after-kicking-off-the-initiative-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57255-next-steps-after-kicking-off-the-initiative-3\"></a>Next steps, after kicking off the initiative</h3>\n<p>Once we have deployed our first instance of the Immersion programme, we will promote the programme to other university societies, starting with the societies that participated in the initial community engagement activities of the current initiative.</p>\n<p>Farstar will place the Immersion workshop content on chain so that is accessible to any university society that would want to run with it.</p>\n<p>We also intend to build a community around Immersion, providing guidance in forking content, so that it can be tailored to better fit with other contexts and verticals to foster adoption (eg. including local role models and vertical-specific exercises) without breaking the peer learning pedagogy.</p>\n<p>A more long term vision on this community is that it may also provide a way for tracking activity and offering follow-on incubation and acceleration support where it is needed.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57255-immersion-for-your-blockchain-society-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57255-immersion-for-your-blockchain-society-4\"></a>Immersion for your Blockchain society?</h3>\n<p>Are you interested in what Immersion looks like and how it works?

class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57181-dao-treasury-challenges-2\"></a>DAO Treasury Challenges</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ARBITRUM DAO’s treasury currently lacks sufficient diversification for a DAO of its size, with its spending power overwhelmingly exposed to ARB price risk.</li>\n<li>There has been a lot of debate amongst delegates about whether to diversify ARB to increase long-term runway in stables (and thus, sustainability) or to focus on reducing ARB circulation and pricing pressure.</li>\n<li>There is currently no work openly being done to scope out and agree on the needs of the DAO more holistically on the treasury side.</li>\n<li>The DAO could benefit from having such a framework for DAOs to make more informed decisions moving forward.</li>\n<li>There is currently no process or method of accountability to submit proposals in a competitive manner leaving the DAO susceptible to providers overcharging on fees or winning mandates simply because they were first to propose.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57181-goals-of-proposal-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57181-goals-of-proposal-3\"></a>Goals of Proposal</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish a DAO Treasury Oversight Committee to formalize a treasury management process and reach consensus on goals and objectives</li>\n<li>The DAO treasury Oversight Committee should also be responsible for overseeing operational aspects of allocating to underlying DAO treasury managers.</li>\n<li>Empower this committee to set overall DAO treasury goals and objectives as well as a holistic and comprehensive portfolio management strategy for the DAO which suits these goals and objectives</li>\n<li>Empower the Committee to create a framework on research and selection/removal criteria of managers</li>\n<li>Obtain feedback on this approach going forward from all key delegates and stakeholders</li>\n<li>Kick off the nomination and selection process of the DAO Treasury Oversight Committee</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57181-rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57181-rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Last week, Karpatkey initiated one of the largest <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301/63\">proposals</a> in DAO history to manage 250m ARB of the treasury. This proposal hit a lot of good notes with parts of the community and was delivered by a liked and reputable team. However, it’s important to listen to the key messages and feedback coming into this vote which ended up with 61% of delegates against.</p>\n<p>Some of the key messages arising from this result can be summarised as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees were deemed too high (flat 1%) and potentially not aligned properly with the DAO (eg. based on performance rather than management)</li>\n<li>The size was too big, especially for a single treasury manager</li>\n<li>There was a lot of pushback on the lack of an RFP process, particularly given the size, fees, and the stark contrast to the rigorous process followed in other programs such as STEP</li>\n<li>There were a couple of comments around operational risk and importance of infrastructure diversification</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There were concerns around the optimal amount to diversify for a treasury denominated mainly in ARB (headline dollar number is not a “real” number)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There was some discussion around the tradeoff between “yield” on stable coins vs “higher circulation” of tokens in the market which could further depress ARB price making the whole proposition less attractive in the first place</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Questions around the point of selling ARB upfront vs letting contributors sell it when they need to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No plan to maintain the ARB price and thus neglecting security of the protocol</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Debate around the size of the Oversight Committee (e.g. that it should be increased from 3 to 5)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is clear that no-one stands to benefit from the current lack of strategy and process when it comes to deciding the fate of one of the largest treasuries. It’s essential to first have a DAO-wide conversation about treasury management, its purpose, and the amount of ARB we should allocate towards it. This conversation should be facilitated by a DAO oversight committee working towards this particular deliverable.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57181-proposal-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57181-proposal-5\"></a>Proposal</h1>\n<p>We propose the establishment of a DAO Treasury Oversight Committee to establish treasury management strategy &amp; process, undertake operational tasks of deploying capital and taking care of monitoring and governance of underlying treasury managers.</p>\n<p>To get there we propose two key steps:</p>\n<p>Step 1: Feedback &amp; discussion phase (two weeks)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asking delegates to provide feedback on this RFP process to create a Treasury Oversight Committee</li>\n<li>Avantgarde to review feedback and update the proposal accordingly into a final RFP which is published and voted on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Step 2: Nomination period for DAO Oversight Committee</p>\n<p>The DAO Treasury Oversight Committee will be responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposing the overall strategy and objectives for the Arbitrum DAO. Note: It is of extreme importance to strike the right balance between diversification of assets vs more circulating ARB liquidity in the market. It is important for the Committee to make a strong case for how much ARB should be diversified (if at all), into what assets, and why.

The on-chain smart contract suite includes a voting protocol alongside a series of contracts that will forward the proposal’s intended action to the correct destination before executing it.</p>\n<p>The proposal focuses on extending the time delay between when the voting protocol has concluded and the time it takes for the successful proposal to be passed along by the system until it is in the right destination to be executed.

We also provide a detailed timeline of the anticipated Upgrade Rollout and information on the current and new Governor contacts.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57124-background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57124-background-2\"></a>Background</h1>\n<p>The Governance Upgrade has been funded by a <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387\">proposal from Tally</a> and the upgrade implementation by ScopeLift has already been <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governor-v2-review/26118/1\">reviewed</a> by OpenZeppelin to ensure it is secure. ScopeLift has since <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governance-smart-contract-upgrade-technical-details/24642/6\">shared</a> the finalized contract code and migration scripts which have been available for the community to review for the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>As ScopeLift moves forward to propose the upgrade, it’s important to ensure that the Arbitrum community is aware of the need for a moratorium on new proposals during the early stages of the upgrade process. This is due to the fact that the upgrade is being performed by migrating both the Treasury and Core Governor contracts to new smart contracts, rather than performing a proxy upgrade. ScopeLift has specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend that once this proposal is onchain, no new proposals are created until after it passes… (or fails, of course). If a proposal were to be created during this time, it would likely get stuck and have to be resubmitted to the corresponding new Governor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given this requirement, it’s important that all governance participants are aware and abstain from submitting new proposals to the current governance contracts once the Upgrade Proposal is submitted.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57124-upgrade-rollout-timeline-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57124-upgrade-rollout-timeline-3\"></a>Upgrade Rollout Timeline</h1>\n<p>Given the requirement for a proposal moratorium while the Upgrade is pending, it’s important that all governance participants are made aware of each stage of the Upgrade Rollout. As such, we recommend all delegates review and understand the following stages of the upgrade timeline below. <em>Please note that some dates are estimates due to the potential for small extensions or delays in the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">governance process</a>.</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Now until Sept 1st</strong>: Any proposals that governance participants wish to submit on-chain before the Upgrade must be submitted before Sept 1st. This ensures that these proposals can be passed and executed before the current governance contracts are deprecated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>On Sept 2nd</strong>: A Proposal will be submitted to upgrade governance through a migration to the new Governor contracts. <strong><em>Any proposals that may be unwittingly submitted to the current Governor contracts after this point will be unable to execute and need to be resubmitted to the new Governor contracts.</em></strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sept 2nd to Sept 19th:</strong> The Upgrade Proposal will go through a 3-day review period followed by a 14-day vote. Once quorum is reached on the Upgrade Proposal, delegates may consider submitting proposals to the new Governor contracts, although this comes with some risk before the proposal is executed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sept 19th to Oct 4th</strong>: Assuming the Upgrade Proposal has passed, it will be pending execution, taking its usual path of going from the L2 Timelock, to the L1 Timelock, and finally to the L2 Executor which can make upgrade calls on the L2 Timelock. During this time, DAO infrastructure tools, such as Tally, should begin the process of migrating to use the new Governor contracts targeted in the Upgrade, while still preserving the history of prior proposals from the old Governor contracts. This will ensure that all new proposals submitted on-chain by delegates will default to the new Governor contracts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Oct 4th</strong>: The Upgrade Proposal will be executed with a call to the respective timelocks to remove the old Governor’s proposer and canceller roles and add those roles for the new Governors. This will complete the upgrade with new governance contracts having the role permissions necessary to execute any proposals submitted prior.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57124-proposal-moratorium-preliminary-submissions-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57124-proposal-moratorium-preliminary-submissions-4\"></a>Proposal Moratorium &amp; Preliminary Submissions</h1>\n<p>Given the upgrade timeline, there will need to be a moratorium on proposals submitted to the DAO while the Upgrade is taking place. The least risky approach would be to avoid any on-chain proposal submissions between the time that the Upgrade Proposal is submitted and its execution nearly 1 month later. However, there is an option for proposals to be submitted to the new Governor contracts prior to the execution of the Upgrade. This allows new proposals to be submitted ~2 weeks sooner with only the minor risk that these proposals are disrupted by an unforeseen issue with the execution of the Upgrade Proposal.</p>\n<p>Given the tradeoffs, we propose a Proposal Moratorium for delegates to follow along with the option for proposals to be submitted in a Preliminary Period while the Upgrade execution is pending:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proposal Moratorium Period (Sept 2nd to Sept 19th)</strong>: Proposals should <strong>NOT</strong> be submitted to ANY Arbitrum Governor contracts between the time of the Governance Upgrade Proposal submission and the end of the Voting Period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preliminary Proposal Submission Period (Sept 19th to Oct 4th)</strong>: Proposals <strong>MAY</strong> be submitted to only the NEW Arbitrum Governor contracts between the end of the Voting Period (assuming the proposal has passed) and the Upgrade execution. Any proposals submitted during this time take the risk of an issue in the Upgrade execution disrupting their proposal, although that risk is minimal and will simply require the proposal to be resubmitted later. Tally (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/frisson\">@frisson</a>) has committed to migrating their platform to the new Governor contracts during this period so that proposals can be submitted with minimal friction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57124-governor-contract-addresses-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57124-governor-contract-addresses-5\"></a>Governor Contract Addresses</h1>\n<p>ScopeLift has already deployed the new governance contracts that will be utilized in the Governance Upgrade.

Since EIP-4844’s arrival in March, Arbitrum’s sequencer has generated $10M, representing an annualized pace of $25M. The arrival of blobs have drastically reduced both revenue and expenses for rollups. Arbitrum’s profit margin is much improved, but its $10M profit in the first 5 months after 4844 is significantly propped up by outlier events. In the week of June 17, Arbitrum earned $3.5M profit, benefitting from an uptick in activity during the LayerZero TGE.</p>\n<p>These outlier events are difficult to forecast, and perhaps give an overly optimistic outlook on Arbitrum Sequencer profit, but these one-off events are commonplace in crypto and will continue to occur.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57008-orbit-chains-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57008-orbit-chains-3\"></a>Orbit Chains</h3>\n<p>Arbitrum Orbit chains are L3s.

Roughly 6M ARB per month will hit the market through DAO expenses, and 92M ARB/month will come from team and investor unlocks. This is a total of 1.2B ARB per year, not including any additional DAO spending. This represents 36% of ARB’s 3.3B circulating supply and $700M in annual sell pressure at ARB’s current price of $0.57.</p>\n<p>Becoming the first L2 token to share revenue with stakers will be a powerful narrative and sentiment booster, but is likely inadequate to mitigate the unlock climate. Supplementing the real yield with treasury ARB is likely necessary to act as a shield for supply dilution.</p>\n<p>The most difficult aspect of this exercise will be finding the optimal amount of ARB to offset ARB dilution. Dedicating treasury resources to improving the token holder climate offers concrete benefits to the DAO; it offers a more sustainable habitat for long-term holders and prevents the need to liquidate ARB to front-run unlocks. This will support ARB price and mitigate the issue of decreasing ARB price and reduced purchasing power for DAO spending.</p>\n<p>2.9B ARB are remaining of team and investor unlocks. Theoretically, Arbitrum could dedicate almost the entirety of its 3.1B treasury ARB to offset ARB unlocks. This exaggerated example would deplete over 90% of treasury ARB resources, but it’s a helpful way to frame the optimization problem that faces the DAO. In order to improve sentiment around the ARB token, a material portion of the ARB treasury will be necessary. In addition, providing clarity around the timing and use of future DAO spend could prevent the market from lumping it in with unlocks.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57008-staking-program-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57008-staking-program-6\"></a>Staking Program</h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum Staking program should be designed to incentivize delegation while also ensuring delegates are active, as the DAO suffers from a lack of participation amongst delegates. We believe rewarding delegates who are active in governance is the best approach. However, systems currently in place do this but have not been successful in ensuring delegates’ votes.</p>\n<p>Users’ stake’ their ARB by delegating to themselves or a third-party delegate.</p>\n<p>Rewards can be distributed in weekly epochs with a split of 90:10 between delegators and delegates.</p>\n<p>If a delegate fails to vote on all of the proposals that week, they and their delegates should not receive ARB rewards for that week. This incentivizes active delegation and ensures delegators are careful whom they delegate their ARB to.</p>\n<p>The program should be incentivized with X% of the Sequencer, Orbit fees, and Timeboost revenue.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Timeboost proposal offers two options for the proceeds of the revenue generated:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Collect the proceeds in ETH and send them to the DAO.</li>\n<li>Collect the proceeds in ARB and send them to the burn address.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We propose a third option: collect the proceeds in ARB and distribute to stakers.</p>\n<p>Burning the ARB collected from Timeboost misaligns incentives between long-term and short-term ARB holders. Instead of reducing the ARB supply, the DAO should focus on putting ARB tokens in the hands of holders who are aligned with Arbitrum’s long-term mission. This is likely to be the holders delegating and the delegates.</p>\n<p>The revenue generated from the sequencer and Orbit fees is not consequential enough to justify being the only sources of revenue directed to the staking program. Therefore, we believe it is in the best interest of the DAO to direct Timeboost revenue to the staking program as well.</p>\n<p>All revenue should either be collected as ARB or ETH and swapped into ARB to distribute to stakers.</p>\n<p>This is because distributing as a buyback will be net positive for ARB’s price performance and help reduce regulatory risks associated with distributing in-kind.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57008-supplementary-reward-approaches-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57008-supplementary-reward-approaches-7\"></a>Supplementary reward approaches</h3>\n<p>Standard, flat - A standard X ARB distributed to stakers over X months approach is safe, easily digestible, and potentially effective. ARB staking rewards from the DAO partially offset ARB unlocks. ARB stakers effectively maintain a greater portion of their share of total network ownership than non-stakers and receive tangible upside in network traction through real yield. The risk with this approach is that it is not sufficiently differentiated from other models. With at least 1.2B /year hitting the market, Arbitrum may not want to dedicate a large amount of ARB to offset 25% of the unlocks for the market to just not care because the situation is still suboptimal.</p>\n<p>Linear decay - A front-loaded strategy offers a no-nonsense approach to the current ARB price action and provides a path to sunsetting for real yield. This approach would somewhat mirror Optimism’s approach, whereby RPGF rounds are funded with OP, before tapering off in favor of sequencer fees.</p>\n<p>For example, 20% of treasury ARB (60M) is dedicated to the program, with 35M in the first year, 15M in year 2, and 10M in year 3. ARB rewards would materially offset dilution immediately, tapering off while real yield increases.</p>\n<p>One drawback of this approach is ARB hitting circulating supply accelerates in the short term. However, holding ARB will become much more attractive for long-term stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Linear growth - Yet another option could involve scaling up ARB emissions as more ARB hit the market. This would allow ARB staking rewards to keep pace with an expanding circulating supply in the months to come. The issue here is that ARB staking will be resource-intensive later on when, ideally, alternative income streams are up and running. ARB staking will also be less impactful on a token-for-token basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Standard flat, safe option for supplementary ARB rewards may be the best fit if the DAO is willing to dedicate a substantial portion of the treasury (25-30%) to the staking program over the next few years. If the DAO prefers to spend less on the staking program, the linear decay approach may work better in order to allow for strategy on behalf of the user to make the opportunity worthwhile. Using a front loaded 15% of treasury arb for staking rewards could give similar benefits to the prior option in the short run.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum should seriously consider a strong investment into the supplementary staking rewards. Prior snapshot concluded 100M (3%) of the budget, more of the unlocks. Holding ARB is unattractive, and this dynamic has harmful repercussions to DAO operations and in the community. Arbitrum has a healthy supply of ARB in the treasury, and should consider deploying it while it is most effective.</p>\n            <p><small>8 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/follow-up-dao-income-sources-and-the-path-to-staking/26447\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/follow-up-dao-income-sources-and-the-path-to-staking/26447","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Aug 2024 14:30:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26447"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/follow-up-dao-income-sources-and-the-path-to-staking/26447.rss","#text":"Follow Up -- DAO Income Sources and The Path to Staking"},"filter":false},{"title":"Protector Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"commons17119","category":"Delegate Statements","description":"<p>This is Protector’s delegate communication thread.</p>\n<p>Delegate Name: Protector<br>\nDelegate Address: 0x6F1c94D507B875E28b93965822A72bbaE6720e81</p>\n<p>We only exercise our vote in opposition.</p>\n<p>We are a governance team of three.When there is one or fewer dissenting votes, we abstain.

Executive Summary</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56960-background-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56960-background-3\"></a>Background</h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (”ADPC”), composed of Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal, is coming to the end of its first phase on August 20, 2024. As such, this proposal aims to extend the ADPC’s tenure into Phase II for a 6-month period, which will commence on the date on which the Tally vote for this proposal is executed on-chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56960-outcome-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56960-outcome-4\"></a>Outcome</h3>\n<p>The ADPC’s pilot phase proceeded successfully, with significant outcomes to Arbitrum DAO and a range of key learnings for the committee. Creating a comprehensive procurement process from the ground up to ensure that Arbitrum is seen as a leader not only in the technical sphere but also within decentralized governance has been a great opportunity.</p>\n<p>We laid the foundation for the ADPC to be an effective set-up bringing the benefits of well-structured procurement to Arbitrum DAO. Cost savings will result from the creation and use of procurement frameworks and marketplaces developed by the ADPC uniquely for Arbitrum DAO as well as the necessary legal and operational infrastructure and strategic sourcing methodology.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56960-way-ahead-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56960-way-ahead-5\"></a>Way Ahead</h3>\n<p>The ADPC’s initial phase was conducted as a proof of concept demonstrating the capability of the team and the benefits arising from the strategic use of advanced sourcing methodology. The ADPC proposes to build on these successes into Phase II of the ADPC’s engagement. In this Phase II, the ADPC, after careful alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO, proposes to work on all of the following work packages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Work Package 1: Procurement for [2] tactical verticals</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Vertical 1 will be focused on procuring RPC providers for projects building in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This decision is based on engagement with delegates and stakeholders as well as an understanding of the core services required by all projects looking to build in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal. Please note that the ADPC will not request any funding for its events services procurement in that separate proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The scope within the 6-month term is to develop evaluation criteria, draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP/tender), evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s. Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in the scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those internal legal processes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Further details on our process for arriving at these shortlisted verticals can be found below in the section on Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Work Package 2:</strong> Continued management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services and, based on the success of the first cohort, publishing the proposal for an extension of the fund.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Work Package 3</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Definition and creation of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget for the Arbitrum DAO, to be custodied by the Multi-Signature Safe (MSS), and allocated towards the utilisation of service providers as whitelisted by the ADPC. This creates a utilisation rail for the DAO to be able to utilise the services of the whitelisted service providers procured by the ADPC. Without this in place, the DAO is unable to utilise these service providers without the full proposal process (Forum, Snapshot, On-Chain).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ADPC will draft and propose the OpEx proposal to the DAO;  further details, including the process and procedure for utilization of the OpEx budget by the DAO, will be outlined in this seperate proposal to the DAO. This seperate proposal will contain multiple options for the size of the OpEx budget for the community to vote on.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Work Package 4</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Creating a Phase II Outcome Report, similar to the one we have <a href=\"https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">published</a> for Phase I, and submitting it to the DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continued alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO on the evolution of the Arbitrum DAO’s structure, and ensuring that the ADPC fits into any structure that is defined (e.g., OpCo).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ad-hoc tasks, e.g., aligning and connecting whitelisted service providers with existing and incoming projects on Arbitrum, existing and incoming DAO proposals, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Optional Additional Verticals:</strong> On completion of Work Package 1 and subject to (i) DAO demand and (ii) capacity of the ADPC at that point, procurement for up to [2] additional verticals on request from the DAO after approval by the DAO governance process. Where the procurement for such additional verticals is likely to require an extension to the ADPC term, this Work Package will be contingent on that renewal being granted by the DAO to avoid partial completion of tasks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The overall budget for the 6-month term will be USD 414,000 including OpEx, details on which can be found below in the Budget &amp; Methodology section. It will be paid in six monthly instalments in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective calendar month. The Funding Request from the on-chain vote will be  907,457 ARB based on the time weighted average ARB price of $<strong>0.547464135</strong>/ARB as further outlined below. A buffer has been added so that, in the case of ARB depreciation, the ADPC multi-sig is still able to satisfy payments to the ADPC’s members. Unutilized ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury.</p>\n<p>The multi-sig requested to manage the funds will be within the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)</a> established by Entropy Advisors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56960-acknowledgements-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56960-acknowledgements-6\"></a><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></h3>\n<p>We would like to acknowledge the consistent participation and deep input from the Arbitrum community, delegates, and stakeholders, without whom our progress would not have been possible.

Background of the ADPC</h1>\n<p>The ADPC was established as a crucial component of the Arbitrum ecosystem’s governance structure, following a successful proposal and subsequent community vote in early 2024. The formation of the ADPC was driven by the growing need for a structured, transparent, and efficient approach to procurement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the ecosystem’s growth, security, and sustainability.</p>\n<p>The inception of the ADPC can be traced back to discussions within the Arbitrum community about the challenges faced by projects building on the protocol, particularly in securing high-quality service providers. These discussions highlighted the need for a pre-emptive quality assurance mechanism that could benefit the entire ecosystem. Against the background that a dedicated procurement framework has, to our knowledge, not been established in any DAO prior, the committee’s formation marked a pivotal moment not only in Arbitrum’s governance evolution, but set a precedent for DAOs in general. We designed the ADPC to address immediate needs and to create a foundation for future growth and efficiency in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Phase I of the ADPC ran for a duration of 182 days from February 21, 2024 (i.e., the day that the KYB for the ADPC members was completed) until August 20, 2024.</p>\n<p>The ADPC’s mandate in Phase I consisted of the following:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56960-a-oversight-of-security-oriented-service-providers-framework-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56960-a-oversight-of-security-oriented-service-providers-framework-8\"></a><strong>A.

Key points included the introduction of Orbit chains, which allow teams to build their own blockchains with customization options. The Arbitrum DAO requires a 10% net revenue contribution from Orbit chains, with 8% going to the DAO Treasury and 2% to a developer guild. Over 60 Orbit chains are publicly announced, with over 100 in development. The discussion highlighted the need for community building, incentives, and infrastructure support. The DAO was encouraged to help amplify the Orbit vision and support cohesive marketing efforts to compete with the “Super Chain” narrative.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56956-speakers-and-participants-3\"

href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbOS 31 “Bianca”</a> onchain vote on Tally has passed quorum, signaling the DAO’s approval to activate Arbitrum Stylus on Arbitrum One and Nova. To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time “Stylus Sprint” program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks and the program will run for 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign’s primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.</p>\n<p>Interested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Today, the Stylus ecosystem is promising but very nascent. At launch, the developer experience will be in its early stages, offering an opportunity for pioneers to shape and refine Stylus as they build with it. Teams building with Stylus today are early adopters of the technology and are pushing the limits of what is possible on the EVM.</p>\n<p>The “Stylus Sprint” is strategically designed to accelerate the adoption of Stylus and help drive visibility into Stylus’ transformative potential to the broader crypto community. Launched in conjunction with Bianca passing, this program aims to strengthen the momentum of the upgrade, drawing significant adoption and attention to the technological advancements it introduces.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts/22970\">Stylus</a> represents a pivotal innovation for the entire Ethereum ecosystem, setting Arbitrum apart from other platforms by enabling the use of multiple programming languages for smart contracts. This not only enhances the efficiency and capabilities of Arbitrum applications but also broadens the accessibility of Arbitrum’s ecosystem to a more diverse group of developers. By supporting smart contracts written in languages such as Rust, C, and C++, Stylus expands the scope of possible applications, unlocking untapped use cases for end users and making Arbitrum a more versatile and attractive platform for developers. This capability represents a tangible competitive advantage for Arbitrum, and it is crucial that this differentiator is prominently showcased via its use in high-value developments.</p>\n<p>The “Stylus Sprint” will provide financial incentives to encourage the development of high-quality projects. This support aims to attract top-tier developers from within the Arbitrum, EVM, and Rust communities, targeting teams new to Arbitrum that can only realize their ideas with Stylus, existing Arbitrum projects with complex computation for migration, and developers from other WASM ecosystems (e.g., Solana Rust Devs), fostering a diverse range of applications. By demonstrating the practical benefits and performance enhancements Stylus offers, the program seeks to establish a robust portfolio of Stylus-based contracts, helping solidify Arbitrum’s position as a leader in the rollup race. The Sprint will also empower developers to create building blocks for a wide variety of projects building on Arbitrum such as reference contracts, Rust libraries, testing/development frameworks, and SDK contributions. Reference tooling and code are crucial to any development-based ecosystem’s staying power.</p>\n<p>The Stylus Sprint aims to create a ripple effect of innovation and adoption, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and capable Arbitrum ecosystem for developers, users, and token holders.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-rationale-and-goals-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-rationale-and-goals-4\"></a>Rationale and Goals</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Demonstrate the efficiency of, and untapped possibilities with, Stylus by showing how teams can build never-before-built protocols on Arbitrum and take advantage of Stylus’ efficiency and compute advantages.</li>\n<li>Support network growth and accelerate the distribution of capital to both EVM and non-EVM protocols that migrate to Stylus to further drive network and ecosystem growth. This includes infrastructure as well as applications.</li>\n<li>Attract top protocols from other ecosystems drawn by Stylus’ efficiency gains and multi-language support, which in turn will bring their user bases, increasing overall activity and transaction volume on the network.</li>\n<li>Implement a strategy to distribute grants over extended periods and in alignment with the achievement of key milestones. This approach aims to cultivate enduring relationships with protocols and ensure sustained development and engagement.</li>\n<li>Position Arbitrum as the most accessible, efficient, and powerful EVM-compatible ecosystem to build in.</li>\n<li>Provide ample resources, support, and incentives to developers utilizing Stylus, fostering robust projects and vibrant communities. This will drive the long-term growth and success of Arbitrum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-application-process-rfp-details-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-application-process-rfp-details-6\"></a>Application Process &amp; RFP Details:</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.</p>\n<p>For the open-application track, non-exhaustive categories may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New developer-focused infrastructure or extensions of existing developer-focused infrastructure to improve the arsenal of tools available to Stylus builders;</li>\n<li>New applications that feature untapped use cases only made possible via Stylus, on Arbitrum One or new app chains using Stylus on Orbit chains;</li>\n<li>External WebAssembly (WASM) application or chain migrations (from ecosystems that use Rust for their smart contracts);</li>\n<li>Existing EVM application migrations from Solidity to Rust (e.g., an app rewriting a portion of their code using Stylus).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the RFP track, the committee is excited to hear proposals from teams working on developing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tooling to add support for new languages with Stylus to expand the reach and adoption of Stylus among developers. This can include new SDKs, EVM-tooling specific to the new language, and/or reference implementations and libraries for the new language. To get inspired for what languages might be interesting to see support get added for:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.assemblyscript.org/introduction.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AssemblyScript</a> - a Typescript-based programming language optimized for, and statically compiled down to, WASM. Typescript is a widely used programming language, with 38.5% of all developers claiming to have used or currently use Typescript, compared to 12.6% for Rust <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">according to Statista</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://move-language.github.io/move/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Move</a> - a resource-oriented, strongly typed programming language that offers built-in support for formal verification of code correctness. Originally developed by Meta for their Libra/Diem stablecoin, this language has gained popularity among emergent L1s like Flow, Aptos, and Sui. Adding Move support to Stylus and by extension the EVM opens the opportunity for Move-based applications to tap into the already-massive Arbitrum ecosystem and the liquidity layer of Ethereum.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A GUI for developers to inspect and interact with the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-cache-manager\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stylus cache manager</a> on Arbitrum One. Extra consideration will be given to teams who make such a service/instance self-hostable to unlock widespread adoption and use among Stylus Orbit chains. Example user journeys that can be covered are:\n<ul>\n<li>How a developer inspects the contents of the cache;</li>\n<li>How a developer gets the minimum bid price before bidding;</li>\n<li>How a developer makes a bid for their contract to join the cache;</li>\n<li>How a developer views the position of their contract within the cache, and/or;</li>\n<li>How a developer can subscribe to events or changes to the cache as it pertains to their contract(s).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A Solidity-to-WASM compiler to reduce the migration cost (for existing applications) of moving over to WASM. This in turn aims to help current Solidity projects reap the benefits of a more secure and performant WASM VM sooner and with less upfront work.</li>\n<li>General improvements to the current debugging workflow and developer experience for Stylus applications and Orbit chain developers. This can include compatibility enhancements and Stylus-specific improvements to how GDB is currently used to debug Stylus applications, or the introduction/integration of new tooling to elevate the UX of Stylus contract debugging.</li>\n<li>General enhancements and/or extensions to the existing Stylus Rust SDK, the cargo-stylus command line tool, and/or the WASM VM within Arbitrum Nitro itself.</li>\n<li>Stylus-specific education and developer relations materials to onboard the next generation of Web3 developers.</li>\n<li>Tools and frameworks to demonstratively help <a href=\"https://cosmwasm.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CosmWASM</a> and Solana projects (as examples) to migrate to Arbitrum chains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.</p>\n<p>Teams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-evaluation-committee-and-committee-advisors-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-evaluation-committee-and-committee-advisors-7\"></a>Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors</h3>\n<p>To effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Additionally, a group of advisors will provide consultative support to the committee, although the advisors will not possess decision-making authority. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far. Currently, there are limited experts qualified to assess Stylus applications effectively. However, should the DAO prefer to engage in a broader selection process that we believe would be inefficient and lead to a less successful program, Entropy Advisors is more than happy to facilitate an RFP process instead, contingent upon a DAO vote to define and appoint these roles.</p>\n<p>Evaluation Committee</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Derek Lee - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)</li>\n<li>Chris Cordle - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)</li>\n<li>Srinjoy Chakraborty - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)</li>\n<li>Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)</li>\n<li>Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)</li>\n<li>Matt Hamilton - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Committee Advisors</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Committee Advisors’ main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible. <strong>Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.</strong></p>\n<p>Judges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 2 months will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects. <strong>Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future.</strong> In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-recommended-application-structure-and-framing-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-recommended-application-structure-and-framing-8\"></a>Recommended Application Structure and Framing</h3>\n<p>Applications for the program will be rigorously evaluated based on a set of clearly defined criteria. To ensure a thorough assessment, grantees are encouraged to provide detailed information about their plans and objectives for the grant. Each application should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What their plans are to grow their protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem;</li>\n<li>How closely the team’s mission aligns with those of Arbitrum;</li>\n<li>Whether or not they clearly demonstrate how they will utilize Stylus;</li>\n<li>An appropriate spending plan for how the grant will be used;</li>\n<li>A reasonable development plan and timeline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Judges and advisors may also consider other relevant metrics tailored to the specifics of each application. These could include innovation potential, the experience of the team, market readiness, user engagement strategies, or any other factors deemed relevant.</p>\n<p>The recommendations above are designed to ensure that the selected projects are coming to the committee with a high-quality plan and to ensure that the application ideas are not only viable, but also poised to make significant contributions to the Arbitrum ecosystem. By adhering to this application structure, the evaluation process aims to foster transparency, fairness, and alignment with the strategic objectives of the Arbitrum network. The judges and advisors will work together to create the application and evaluation criteria. We envision the entire process taking place in the forum, though we will explore pricing around hosting it on Questbook instead.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-application-evaluation-criteria-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-application-evaluation-criteria-9\"></a>Application Evaluation Criteria</h3>\n<p>While we strongly believe each application will be unique and should therefore be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, a baseline framework and evaluation criteria are outlined below to give teams a feel for what to keep in mind when applying and building.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Evaluation Committee will be on the lookout for, and prioritize evaluating applications, that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can scale, or help scale</strong>, Stylus usage over the long run. Examples include tooling and frameworks that can be extended, built upon, and leveraged by many teams all at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Contribute to the young, but growing, ecosystem of Stylus tooling and infrastructure</strong>, rather than direct contributions to individual Stylus applications and Stylus Orbit chains.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on projects that aim to be self-sustainable in the medium to long term</strong>, rather than one-off projects that can only exist/survive for the short duration of the program.</li>\n<li><strong>Directly highlight core Stylus benefits and strengths with excellent creativity</strong>, including the efficient use of computational and storage resources or security primitives that Stylus bolsters and shines at.</li>\n<li><strong>Fill a specific, unique niche in the market</strong>, as opposed to re-implementing an existing application, tool, or chain in Stylus for the sake of using Stylus (and not the other purported benefits one gets with Stylus).</li>\n<li><strong>Come from outside the Arbitrum and/or Ethereum ecosystem</strong> to effectively “grow the pie” of Web3 projects and users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that applications may be rejected for a variety of reasons as there are a limited number of resources to allocate to a near-infinite pool of great ideas/applicants that can emerge. Out of scope are projects that are already being funded by the ArbitrumDAO, Offchain Labs, or the Arbitrum Foundation, or are otherwise nearing completion by the time this program’s evaluation period ends. Examples of this include the development of the Stylus Rust SDK that is already being scoped out and developed by Offchain Labs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-multisig-setup-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-multisig-setup-10\"></a>Multisig Setup</h3>\n<p>The Stylus Sprint multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program and 150K ARB for payments to judges. Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-funding-levels-and-disbursement-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-funding-levels-and-disbursement-11\"></a>Funding Levels and Disbursement</h3>\n<p>Teams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K, 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones.</p>\n<p>Unallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don’t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.</p>\n<p>Funding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. 50% of funds will be distributed after deployment to encourage teams to think about growth and sustainability post-launch. The criteria for these 2 checkpoints will be proposed by teams in their applications.</p>\n<p>Milestone distribution will function as the following are achieved:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>10% - Planning</strong> + Building: Creation of a Development Plan, Architecture Design, Prototyping, Implementation, Optimization.</li>\n<li><strong>30% - Deployment</strong>: Testing, Auditing, Deployment. *Projects will be eligible but not guaranteed admission into the subsidy program per the ADPC</li>\n<li><strong>25% - Checkpoint 1</strong></li>\n<li><strong>25% - Checkpoint 2</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>All projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. The above milestone structure, however, is not required. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above. The evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-grant-eligibility-requirements-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-grant-eligibility-requirements-12\"></a>Grant Eligibility Requirements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Grantees must participate in a case study that highlights their Stylus development experience</li>\n<li>Grantees must build their projects open source, but not necessarily free to use.

The first 2 weeks will be used to refine and post the RFPs, followed by open applications for 8 weeks, then a 2-week application review process. Feedback between the Evaluation Committee and applicants will be conducted on an ongoing/continuous basis over the next 10 weeks. KYC with the foundation will then begin and first milestone payments may be allocated upon completion. The MSS chairs, Arbitrum Foundation, and Entropy Advisors will need to work closely to ensure a strict payment process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-overall-cost-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-overall-cost-14\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p><strong>5,150,000 ARB</strong></p>\n<p>Up to 5M to be awarded to projects building on Stylus</p>\n<p>75,000 ARB payment in total over 14.5 months per committee member for 2 committee members = 150,000 ARB</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-fund-the-stylus-sprint/26437\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-fund-the-stylus-sprint/26437","pubDate":"Tue, 20 Aug 2024 16:34:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26437"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-fund-the-stylus-sprint/26437.rss","#text":"[RFC] Fund The Stylus Sprint"},"filter":false},{"title":"Arbitrum DAO - Monthly Token Flow Report - Genesis to July 2024","dc:creator":"r3gen_Finance","category":"DAO Finances","description":"<p>This category is for the Arbitrum DAO’s monthly token flow report.
