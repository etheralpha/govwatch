Workshops to provide insights on best practices in order to help the Arbitrum DAO distribute grant funding for scalable, impactful growth.</p>\n<p>Our invite-only participants have demonstrated great interest in managing their own grant programs, in areas of their expertise, through our application process and our goal is to not only empower their mission, but to also help facilitate the intricacies within the grant funding process.</p>\n<p>For our introductory Planning Grants Workshop, we covered various topics to kick off our thought process behind planning grant programs:</p>\n<p>Planning Grant Workshop Overview section was to go over the high-level goals and details that come with it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rewarding participants for further reining their grant program proposals, claimable at end of ThankARB Season 10</li>\n<li>Attending our Workshops to assure alignment with ThankARB &amp; Arbitrum DAO</li>\n<li>Not guaranteed for future funding - ThankARB is selecting 10 to 15 programs to fund</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We went over our Timeline to give grant program managers an idea of how long we expect these programs to run.</p>\n<p></p><div

This proposal establishes the Arbitrum Startup Collective, a comprehensive program designed to accelerate and bring capital to promising early-stage startups building on or migrating to the Arbitrum protocol and its related product suite.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has successfully launched several initiatives to attract new users and liquidity to Arbitrum through initiatives like grant programs for idea-stage and pre-seed startups (e.g RnDAO, PL, etc), and incentive programs (STIP, Backfund, LTIPP) for later-stage players and established protocols.</p>\n<p>Building on this success, the Arbitrum ecosystem is now ready to explore other models (not grant-based) for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling startups beyond early stages: Supporting the growth of ventures that emerge from existing programs.</li>\n<li>Attracting top teams building on Arbitrum: Enticing high-caliber startups, particularly those in the Seed to Series A stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In collaboration with the Arbitrum DAO, the current founders’ community, and the wider stakeholders; our initiative will aim to support and invest in up to 150 high-potential startups at the Seed to Series A stage and across verticals in the Arbitrum ecosystem over a three year period.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivations-2\"></a>Motivations</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>New model for ecosystem development</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the current up-cycle in the industry, there is a tremendous opportunity for growth and innovation. New market cycles bring higher token prices, which historically attract new builders and new users. Data from <a href=\"https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=22411-monthly-active-open-source-developers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Electric capital’s developer report</a> shows that the number of developers grew 3x during the 2021 bull market and grew 10x in the 2017 bull market.</p>\n<p>Ethereum aside, Polygon and Solana are the top two ecosystems which have attracted more developers than any other ecosystem. Both have been amongst the most active in running venture-style ecosystem development programs such as the Polygon Accelerator, the Polygon Venture fund, the Polygon Village initiative, the Solana Ecosystem Fund, Solana Hackers House, and the Solana Super Team initiatives.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Why does Arbitrum need this initiative?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Arbitrum requires strategic investment initiatives to maintain its rapid growth and solidify its position as a leading ecosystem. While Arbitrum has achieved impressive success with a strong user base and Total Value Locked (TVL), competitors like Optimism and Polygon have deployed significantly more capital to fuel their ecosystem growth. Today, there are programs tackling both ends of the start-up growth spectrum in the Arbitrum ecosystem (refer diagram below) but it seems there is a clear gap at the Seed to Series A level.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hWV1uesBBQ3Gj0DEdWuBdbAHLmO.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_449x164.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hWV1uesBBQ3Gj0DEdWuBdbAHLmO\" width=\"449\" height=\"164\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_449x164.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_673x246.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_898x328.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D6E0E9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Building a successful venture ecosystem cannot rely solely on capital deployed; it is about enabling existing participants, providing structured value creation &amp; support to new participants, and creating hyper-connectivity - that ultimately reinforces a powerful ecosystem growth flywheel.</p>\n<p>Leading startup accelerators like Y Combinator and Techstars demonstrate the power of structured programs. These programs cultivate vibrant communities where startups collaborate, invest in each other, and attract top talent, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth (e.g Paypal “mafia” - the initial group of people who were with PayPal during its early days and that went on to establish influential companies like Tesla, SpaceX, LinkedIn, YouTube, Yelp, and many more).</p>\n<p>The proposed Arbitrum Startup Collective targets strategic investments in up to 150 Arbitrum-focused companies at Seed to Series A stage with a comprehensive support program. This approach stimulates network effects, attracting talent while providing startups with a compelling capital and value creation proposition.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective will activate existing builders and ecosystem participants to serve as mentors and experts, while our team will be responsible for program management, community building across several regions, and founders’ support initiatives. This proposal is a long-term investment that will create lasting value within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>By establishing this Arbitrum Startup Collective now, Arbitrum can continue to solidify its leadership position and propel the network to explosive growth.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What is the expected impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ecosystem funds have historically played a crucial role as growth catalysts for emerging protocols and ecosystems, especially for the growth of developers and decentralized applications (dApps). As a result, new wallets have emerged, contributing to the growth of total value locked (TVL) and ultimately driving growth of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We believe that the Arbitrum Startup Collective will help achieve the following objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funnel capital into the best start-ups building on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Drive adoption of Arbitrum among developers and dApps</li>\n<li>Provide high quality diligence and support to reputable (Web2 &amp; Web3) investors to deploy in Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Geographical diversification and stronger localization in key regions</li>\n<li>Increase the Arbitrum DAO treasury through investments returns</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"initiative-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#initiative-summary-3\"></a>Initiative Summary</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective aims to supercharge the ecosystem by fueling promising startups, attracting developers and dApps, driving more capital into the ecosystem, and ultimately maximizing returns for the Arbitrum DAO treasury.</p>\n<p>a- Growth stage:</p>\n<p>The initiative is designed to tackle three stages of growth to cover the startup lifecycle and provide optimal impact to the Arbitrum ecosystem through tracks of support and investing:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9cbe08baf60fd2f878c6408aa5db48aef94e4c1d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/mmBD9MCjVmTiet2DPrbmTCXNP8V.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9cbe08baf60fd2f878c6408aa5db48aef94e4c1d.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"mmBD9MCjVmTiet2DPrbmTCXNP8V\" width=\"624\" height=\"363\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"EBECE8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The program is envisioned as a three-year initiative. This timeframe acknowledges the maturity cycle of accelerator models and allows for cross-fertilization between different programs within the Startup Collective (e.g., scout program feeding into scale and follow-on programs).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Scout Program (Pre-Seed Focus): To identify the most promising founders in the ecosystem, we propose to leverage a Scout Network composed of experienced entrepreneurs and angel investors deeply familiar with the Arbitrum ecosystem. These scouts significantly extend the reach by leveraging their networks and industry knowledge to uncover innovative ideas before a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Scouts get access to promising startups through various channels, including inbound, referrals through their network, and industry events. This proactive approach allows us to spot ventures before traditional funding rounds, ensuring we capture the most disruptive and impactful ideas for the Arbitrum ecosystem and serve as a feeder to the Scale Program (described below).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scale Program (Seed to Series A stage): These companies already have a product with early users, or demonstrate early signs of success. Seed funding rounds are typically led by venture capitalists to complete product launches and refine growth models. Alongside a capital investment, the Arbitrum Startup Collective offers a structured program to provide additional support and value creation (details below). This program will go beyond just deploying capital and equip startups with the resources they need to thrive, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mentorship: Connect with experienced builders, advisors and mentors who will provide strategic guidance and industry insights.</li>\n<li>Network Access: Gain access to a network of investors, partners, and potential customers within the Arbitrum ecosystem and beyond.</li>\n<li>Technical Resources: Benefit from workshops, educational programs, and access to technical resources to accelerate product development.</li>\n<li>Community Building: Facilitate connections and collaboration between startups within the program and the broader Arbitrum community.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Follow-on (Series A+): For top performers from within the portfolio, the plan is to double down on winners to support them in later stages and maximize upside. Follow-on investments will be limited to companies coming from the Scout or Scale program described above who are proven to increase activity or adoption of Arbitrum</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>b- Geographical focus:</p>\n<p>The initial focus of this initiative will be on Europe, Middle East, and South Asia to allow us to leverage our existing expertise and connections within this region. Although the program is fully remote and there are no requirements for teams to be located at any specific place, there will be in person events organized during the program to drive more collaboration between the teams.</p>\n<p>c- Sector focus:</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective is not sector specific and would consider startups across various sectors as long as they build on or plan to integrate with Arbitrum technology. However, to avoid any overlap with the RnDAO or the GCP initiative, collaboration tools and gaming will be specifically excluded from the Arbitrum Startup Collective to avoid any overlap.</p>\n<p>Expected Outcome</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective is designed to achieve a lasting impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem by fostering a vibrant community of talented developers, entrepreneurs, and users. The key expected outcomes for this initiative include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Innovation: This initiative will act as a catalyst for the success of promising early-stage startups building on Arbitrum. We target up to 150 startups to join or grow in the Arbitrum ecosystem through this initiative. A high percentage of the portfolio companies will achieve significant milestones, generate user activity within the ecosystem, and potentially lead to the launch of groundbreaking startups.</li>\n<li>Network Growth: This initiative will contribute to the creation of a dynamic and engaged Arbitrum ecosystem and we expect the launch of over 10 Orbit chains, fostering a rich and diverse ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) built on Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Financial Returns: This initiative is designed to generate a strong return on investment for the Arbitrum DAO (structured as investments - not grants - with the Arbitrum DAO retaining upside). By strategically investing in high-growth companies and fostering a thriving ecosystem, we aim to deliver exceptional financial returns for the DAO upon the fund’s maturity.</li>\n<li>Attracting Capital: The success of this initiative in fostering innovation and attracting high-caliber startups is expected to generate significant interest from other investors. We anticipate securing co-investment and follow-on capital from these investors - further fueling the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By delivering on these ambitious yet attainable goals, the Arbitrum Startup Collective will propel Arbitrum to the forefront of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"program-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-details-4\"></a>Program Details</h1>\n<p>a- Scout Program</p>\n<p>Scouts are existing members of the Arbitrum DAO or community, experienced entrepreneurs with strong expertise in different domains, and likely already angel investors with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by early-stage founders inside and outside of Web3.</p>\n<p>Scout Program<br>\nCriteria for Scout Selection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Involved within the Arbitrum ecosystem</li>\n<li>Relevant founder or investor experience</li>\n<li>Has demonstrated experience of angel investing<br>\nSelection Process * Run ‘call for application’ for interested individuals to come forward</li>\n<li>Shortlisted candidates to be interviewed and background reviewed</li>\n<li>Recommendations will be made to the Oversight Committee</li>\n<li>Final selection based on recommendation from the Oversight Committee (details in the Governance section)<br>\nCriteria for Investments * Pre-seed / early stage start-up</li>\n<li>Not benefiting from other support from Arbitrum ecosystem</li>\n<li>Building on Arbitrum or planning to integrate Arbitrum technology</li>\n<li>No conflict of interest<br>\nInvestment Structure * Each scout will have an allocation of up to $250k; max 5x investments of up $50k</li>\n<li>Investment in equity, token, or both (dependent on structure and business model)</li>\n<li>Target valuation &lt; $25M</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once elected, Scouts can invest capital into opportunities by following the process below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Submit an investment memo to the Arbitrum Startup Collective team</li>\n<li>The investment team will review if all investment criteria are met, including that capital is directed to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Arbitrum Startup Collective team will conduct expedited due diligence to ensure the capital is being appropriately allocated (e.g. sanctions, background checks, conflict of interest, etc) and other factors that maintain the reputation of the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>The Arbitrum Startup Collective team will review the legal documentation and ensure it is appropriate for such investment (priority will be given to simplicity and using market standard documentation when possible e.g predominantly SAFE, token warrants, and SAFTs as appropriate)</li>\n<li>Capital is deployed directly into the start-up by the Arbitrum Startup Collective investment vehicle</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: Please note that these are structured as investments, not grants. The investments are made through the Arbitrum Startup Collective investment vehicle which will have the Arbitrum DAO as its sole investor. The Arbitrum DAO will therefore retain exposure to the upside from these investments and will receive distributions upon exit.</p>\n<p>The Scouts will be incentivized and compensated for their contribution through an allocation of up to 10% of the upside generated from the investments attributed to them (i.e. if a scout refers a $50,000 investment that is subsequently exited with net proceeds of $500,000; that scout would receive $50,000 compensation). In addition, Scouts will have the opportunity to co-invest alongside the Arbitrum Startup Collective across all the referred opportunities via the broader Scout program.</p>\n<p>b- Scale Program</p>\n<p>The Scale Program is the cornerstone of the Arbitrum Startup Collective, offering a structured journey for seed to Series A startups building on Arbitrum. This immersive program provides tailored mentorship, access to a network of industry experts and investors, and crucial capital to help promising ventures accelerate their growth and navigate the critical early stages of development.</p>\n<p>Scale Program<br>\nProgram Structure * Cohort based program; 2x cohorts per year (e.g 1x in Sept and 1x in April)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3-month program; each week will be focused on a specific topic including business model, growth strategy, token design, listing strategies, fundraising etc …</li>\n<li>hybrid program; predominantly run online to allow start-ups from different regions to join however we will have at least 2 in-person events for each cohort (1x at the beginning to serve as induction week + 1x at the end focusing on fundraising and investors meet-ups)</li>\n<li>Start-up supports include weekly workshops with industry leaders, info sessions, and individual office hours with mentors<br>\nStart-up selection Criteria * Start-ups at Seed to Series A stage</li>\n<li>Not benefiting from other support from Arbitrum ecosystem</li>\n<li>Building on Arbitrum or planning to integrate Arbitrum technology<br>\nInvestment structure * Between $250k and $500k investment amount depending on growth stage</li>\n<li>Investment terms will be negotiated with each start-up on a case by case basis (there are no set terms i.e. $250k investment at a valuation of $10M - similar to YC, Techstars or other programs)</li>\n<li>Target valuation range $25M-50M</li>\n<li>Investment in equity, token, or both (dependent on structure and business model)</li>\n<li>No conflict of interest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: Investments are not based on a fixed valuation structure (i.e. $250k investment at a valuation of $10M - similar to a16z Crypto Startup School, Y-Combinator or other programs). Given start-ups will be coming at different stages of growth, investment terms will be agreed with the start-ups on a case by case basis.</p>\n<p>Throughout the program, startups will have access to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regular community events: opportunities to meet the wider ecosystem of web3 founders, investors, and partners globally at Web3 events in collaboration with the Arbitrum ecosystem participants</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>2x irl events for each cohort (beginning and end of the program)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>demo days and investor day</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>participation in collaboration with major web3 events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perks &amp; Benefits: Curated discounts and product perks from a network of partners (e.g Nethermind, Quantstamp, Gateway, and existing Arbitrum ecosystem startups etc).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access to strategic partners: Access to leading financial and regulatory authorities in Europe and the UAE; support to navigating regulatory frameworks and attracting potential investors.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>c- Follow-on investments</p>\n<p>Follow-on investments are used to double-down on high-performing portfolio companies to maximize returns for the DAO and amplify their positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. This also de-risks the initiative, reducing the likelihood of capital being deployed into startups that are not contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The follow-on investments will be evaluated based on ecosystem contribution (transaction volume, user growth, developer communities) and financial performance. Only those exceeding expectations and strategically aligned with Arbitrum’s long-term vision will receive follow-on funding.</p>\n<p>Follow-On Program<br>\nProgram Structure * Follow-on investments in up to 20 start-ups; around 20% of the start-ups going through the Scout or Scale program (refer to previous slides)<br>\nCriteria for Investments * Series A+ stage</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have participated in the Scout or Scale program (i.e. already an investee company)</li>\n<li>Need to have demonstrated strong contribution to the Arbitrum ecosystem (e.g. transaction volume, user growth, developer communities) and financial performance</li>\n<li>No conflict of interest<br>\nInvestment Structure * Between $750k and $1M investment ticket depending on growth stage</li>\n<li>Target valuation &lt;$100M</li>\n<li>Investment in equity, token, or both (dependent on structure and business model)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>d- Capital Allocation<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1d42e7eddc41df07e3f6650a37fa7997c2e6b9e6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/4aRbUa0NxaJJslQ7qhaWMJl25G6.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-30 at 12.45.49\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1d42e7eddc41df07e3f6650a37fa7997c2e6b9e6.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-30 at 12.45.49\" data-base62-sha1=\"4aRbUa0NxaJJslQ7qhaWMJl25G6\" width=\"690\" height=\"358\" data-dominant-color=\"E6E6E6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"operational-plan-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#operational-plan-5\"></a>Operational Plan</h1>\n<p>This Arbitrum Startup Collective initiative is to be managed by Elixir Capital, an investment and accelerator firm specializing in supporting and investing in early-stage Web3 founders.

This agreement will clearly define the scope of work, outlining Elixir Capital’s responsibilities in detail including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Startup identification, application process, and selection</li>\n<li>Cohort management and program delivery, including mentorship, workshops, and events</li>\n<li>Regular reporting and communication with the Arbitrum DAO Oversight Committee</li>\n<li>Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The service agreement will establish clear performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the service provider. Regular reviews will be conducted by the Arbitrum DAO (through the Oversight Committee) to assess performance against these metrics.</p>\n<p>The service provider’s compensation will be structured to incentivize strong performance and alignment with program goals. It is based on a fixed fee basis to cover core program management activities and is paid based on specific milestones.</p>\n<p>In the event of underperformance or non-compliance with the service agreement, the Arbitrum DAO will have the right to terminate the agreement with reasonable notice. A clear process for transitioning program management to a new service provider will be outlined within the agreement.</p>\n<p>Investment Agreement</p>\n<p>A separate investment agreement will govern the management of funds allocated to the Arbitrum Startup Collective. This agreement will establish a framework that ensures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investor Upside: The Arbitrum DAO, as the investor, retains upside generated from the program’s investments.</li>\n<li>Investment Management: Elixir Capital will be accountable for managing the deployed funds effectively, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio oversight, and exit strategies.</li>\n<li>Investor Liability Protection: The investment agreement will be structured to limit the liability of the Arbitrum DAO as the investor. It will function as a legal shield, protecting the DAO from potential liabilities arising from the fund’s activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the investment nature of the program, we will appoint a professional fund administrator (such as NAV Consulting, Formidium, etc) to manage the vehicle and ensure compliance with the investment agreement. This appointment offers several benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliance: The fund administrator ensures adherence to the investment agreement and relevant regulations.</li>\n<li>Transparency: They provide independent oversight and reporting on the investment portfolio.</li>\n<li>Risk Management: Fund administrators mitigate risks associated with fund operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The investment capital will be contributed to the investment vehicle following a capital call schedule which would likely be twice annually to fund program activities and investments. Upon successful exits, the generated returns and distributions will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO, the sole investor in the program. The investment agreement will include clawback provisions that allow the Arbitrum DAO to recoup investment funds if they are not invested within the investment period.</p>\n<p>The investment manager compensation will be structured to incentivize strong performance and alignment with program goals. It is based on a combination of a fixed management fee and a performance-based fee that incentivizes the investment manager to generate strong returns on the invested capital.</p>\n<p>Note: A formal contractual agreement ensures clarity, transparency, and accountability in the program’s execution and delivery. It outlines expectations for both parties and protects the interests of the Arbitrum DAO as an investor (e.g upside capture, deployment of funds, fund administrator, reporting, etc).</p>\n<p>Phasing &amp; Budget</p>\n<p>Over a three-year timeframe, the program envisions a total investment capital of $50 million.

It will include metrics such as the number of applications received, geographical distribution of applicants, and industry representation.</li>\n<li>Cohort Composition Report (Upon Cohort Selection): This report will detail the composition of each cohort, providing information on the selected startups and their alignment with the program’s objectives.</li>\n<li>Monthly Reports (During Cohort): These reports will provide regular updates on the progress of the current cohort, including program activities, key milestones achieved, and any challenges encountered.</li>\n<li>End of Cohort Report (Post-Program): This comprehensive report will summarize the cohort’s performance. It will include insights from a participant survey, key achievements, Net Promoter Score (NPS) data, key learnings from the program cycle, and recommendations for improvement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these reports, the Arbitrum Startup Collective team will hold monthly calls with the Oversight Committee to discuss program progress, address any feedback, and ensure alignment with the Committee’s expectations.</p>\n<p>b- Investment Reporting</p>\n<p>The Elixir team will also provide the Oversight Committee with regular updates on the program’s investment activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monthly Portfolio Update Reports: These reports will offer a snapshot of the portfolio’s current performance, including new investments, major portfolio updates, etc.</li>\n<li>Semi-Annual Portfolio NAV Report: This report will delve deeper into the portfolio’s Net Asset Value (NAV), providing a detailed valuation of the portfolio at a specific point in time.</li>\n<li>Annual Financial Accounts of the Investment Vehicle: Annual audited financial accounts will be prepared for the investment vehicle, offering complete transparency into the deployment and portfolio investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This comprehensive reporting structure will ensure the Arbitrum DAO, through the Oversight Committee, has the necessary information to effectively monitor the program’s performance and make informed decisions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"acknowledgements-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#acknowledgements-12\"></a>Acknowledgements:</h2>\n<p>We have been working on putting together this initiative for the past couple of months and we would like to thank <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/coinflip\">@coinflip</a> ,<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/krst\">@krst</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/chainlinkgod\">@chainlinkgod</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/soby\">@soby</a>, and the AVI Working group for their feedback and contribution to this proposal.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-startup-collective-ecosystem-growth-in-arbitrum/24531\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-startup-collective-ecosystem-growth-in-arbitrum/24531","pubDate":"Thu, 30 May 2024 13:39:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24531"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-startup-collective-ecosystem-growth-in-arbitrum/24531.rss","#text":"Proposal: The Startup Collective - Ecosystem Growth in Arbitrum."},"filter":false},{"title":"Thank ARB Program Update - Assessors Needed","dc:creator":"BenWest","category":"DAO Grant Programs","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c2e19b7c6d16aef182dc3a735b76b0cd03d42400.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/rNZZqIINIOBiIStMufiXGDAwCxa.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"thanks ARB background2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c2e19b7c6d16aef182dc3a735b76b0cd03d42400_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"thanks ARB background2\" data-base62-sha1=\"rNZZqIINIOBiIStMufiXGDAwCxa\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c2e19b7c6d16aef182dc3a735b76b0cd03d42400_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c2e19b7c6d16aef182dc3a735b76b0cd03d42400_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c2e19b7c6d16aef182dc3a735b76b0cd03d42400_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"196481\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>As the progressive decentralization of our <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-to-fund-plurality-labs-milestone-1b-ridge/21332\">pluralistic grants program</a> continues we have reached an exciting moment.

In the absence of an economic incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-terms-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-3\"></a><strong>Key Terms</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One honest party.</strong> In BoLD, a single party has the capability to protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.</li>\n<li><strong>Assertion.</strong> A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum rollup inbox contract that are ordered by the Sequencer.</li>\n<li><strong>Assertion bond.</strong> Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the submitter to join the validator set by putting up a large bond, in the form of (currently) 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion.</li>\n<li><strong>Proposer.</strong> An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Active proposer.</strong> A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping to advance the chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Service fee.</strong> A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions. The fee is paid for every on-chain assertion posted by the proposer.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenge bond.</strong> The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the big-step and one-step challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"budget-request-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#budget-request-4\"></a><strong>Budget Request</strong></h1>\n<p>This section focuses on the budget request from the ArbitrumDAO treasury alongside the motivation for why the funding is required.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"assertion-and-challenge-bonds-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#assertion-and-challenge-bonds-5\"></a>Assertion and Challenge Bonds</h2>\n<p>We are requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO treasury to cover the bonds required to establish a single honest proposer with the capability to defend the system.</p>\n<p>The requested ETH is a combination of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3600 ETH required to post an assertion bond, and;</li>\n<li>Subsequent 555 ETH + 79 ETH for challenge bonds for one challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation will deposit these funds in the <code>RollupCore.sol</code> contracts on L1 Ethereum for the validator. If the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1\">BoLD AIP</a> passes, then the Arbitrum Foundation’s staked validator will be enabled to immediately act as a proposer for Arbitrum One</p>\n<p><em>Note: the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to be the first active validator, not the ONLY validator. BOLD removes the reliance on a permissioned set of validators, and any interested parties and/or teams can permissionlessly run nodes and validators for Arbitrum chains upon a successful upgrade of the dispute protocol.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"service-fees-for-bold-validators-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#service-fees-for-bold-validators-6\"></a>Service Fees for BOLD Validators</h2>\n<p>All blockchain systems, including Arbitrum, should reward participants who actively work to advance the system.</p>\n<p>In the case of Arbitrum, the DAO will pay a service fee to an active proposer who is helping to advance the system by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet. At the time of writing, the estimated annual income is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH, according to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr\">Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices</a>.</p>\n<p>We must highlight that this payment is a fee and not a reward. In BoLD, a new assertion can be posted every round (1 hour) and only a single fee is paid per round. There can be multiple agents who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1. The proposer whose assertion is accepted by L1 and paid the service fee is called the active proposer for this round. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. Meanwhile, if an entity, say Bob, has posted a successor assertion to one previously made by another entity, Alice, then Bob would be considered by the protocol to be the current active proposer. Alice would no longer be considered by the protocol as the active proposer and once Alice’s assertion is confirmed, then Alice gets her assertion bond refunded.</p>\n<p>We estimate the following service fee per year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Foundation is therefore requesting 500 ETH to support service fee payments for up to 3 years (with a buffer of 68 ETH in case the average Ethereum validator income increases) in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. Moving forward, the DAO may consider allocating a portion of ETH from the ArbitrumDAO governed chains’ sequencer fees to fund the ongoing service fees for active proposers.</p>\n<p>To learn more, please read the section on <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7\">Service Fees in the BOLD AIP</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7\"></a>Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs</h2>\n<p>We are requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain.

Total request is 900 ETH to cover a 3-year period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Depending on the temperature check result:</p>\n<p>a. <strong>Continue to Tally.</strong> If there is strong consensus on both temperature checks, then the AIP will be published as one on-chain AIP on Tally for an on-chain vote.</p>\n<p>b. <strong>Re-iterate on numbers.</strong> If either temperature check is rejected by the DAO, then it will be iterated on and re-submitted for a temperature check again, until the DAO has consensus of what an appropriate ask from the DAO treasury is.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the funds in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1\">AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD</a> is passed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"payment-facilitation-final-costs-restrictions-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#payment-facilitation-final-costs-restrictions-13\"></a>Payment facilitation, final costs &amp; restrictions</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 5,134 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3600 ETH to run the first BOLD-enabled proposer for Arbitrum One,</li>\n<li>634 (555 + 79) ETH budget to counter one BOLD challenge,</li>\n<li>500 ETH as service fees for active BOLD proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation), and,</li>\n<li>400 ETH to reimburse honest parties on their L1 gas costs for 3 years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notable points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to the service fee,</li>\n<li>Arbitrum Foundation will be reimbursed for the L1 gas costs,</li>\n<li>All service fee payments will be manually processed by the Arbitrum Foundation on a periodic basis (weekly or monthly) alongside a requirement that all payments adhere to the Foundation’s compliance process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All requested funds will be sent to a multi-sig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO. Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The ArbitrumDAO reserves the right to revoke the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and return the bonds back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Withdrawal Address.</strong> The funds will be deposited into BoLD and the withdrawal address set to the ‘UpgradeExecutor’ contract on L1.</li>\n<li><strong>Triggering Withdrawal.</strong> The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Put another way, the ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds back to the ArbitrumDAO treasury. This model can be used for future proposals if other entities want to run a proposer on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-funds-to-bootstrap-the-first-bold-validator/24506\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-funds-to-bootstrap-the-first-bold-validator/24506","pubDate":"Wed, 29 May 2024 16:23:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24506"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-funds-to-bootstrap-the-first-bold-validator/24506.rss","#text":"AIP: Funds to bootstrap the first BoLD validator"},"filter":false},{"title":"STIP Bridge Funded Protocols Results","dc:creator":"Matt_StableLab","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<p>The STIP Bridge optimistic funding vote and challenge snapshots have concluded.

To date, RWAs represent a small percentage of Arbitrum’s builder activity, accounting for 1.1% of grants in 2023. It is critical for Arbitrum to take the lead and future-proof platform growth, especially when competitors like Polygon and Avalanche have made significant strides in tokenizing assets on their platforms.</p>\n<p>As promised, we are sharing the summary notes and resources from our session for those who were unable to attend or want to review! Additionally, we now have a dedicated TG channel for comms and questions on this keep topic (h/t Robin Nagpal).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To join the Arbitrum DAO RWA Group on Telegram, click <a href=\"https://t.me/+H0zCKfluNbliMDVh\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"i-key-highlights-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#i-key-highlights-2\"></a><strong>I.

A longer report is coming, and for now we looked at the top 5. A few insights are emerging:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Many of the top delegates are active in multiple DAOs. Clearly a good way to facilitate communication and partnerships, and also a potential source for conflict of interests.</li>\n<li>Looking at the top delegates is a good way to identify lesser known, up and coming DAOs, which draw their interest. See an example in the tweet.</li>\n<li>An open question. Are the top delegates the new financial elite, managing 10s of billions of USD value in top tokens?</li>\n<li>Another open question: are we seeing delegation as a force of centralization, or the opposite, are they a 2nd power center, balancing the power with the original team and the foundation?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’re working on more data and insights.

name=\"abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>OpenZeppelin, as the Security Member of the ARDC, was asked to review the recent <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/24\">Event Horizon proposal</a> that passed its <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x66fd48c246080260275e60e327b4d14d3ca202c6d13aba17e970c55536b44664\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">snapshot vote</a>. We have been asked by the DAO to provide security considerations for voters when the proposal reaches its on-chain Tally vote. We have generally formed our review process from <a href=\"https://defisafety.com/documentation-09\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi Safety’s scoring process</a> to set expectations for Event Horizon’s security posture and make recommendations to mitigate risk.</p>\n<p>In the course of our review, we discussed many of our findings with the Event Horizon team and found their team to be responsive and helpful with our inquiries. We now share our findings and recommendations below to help the Event Horizon team improve their security stance and to better inform Arbitrum delegates on the potential risks that should be carefully considered before moving to an on-chain vote.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"review-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#review-summary-2\"></a>Review Summary</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"team-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#team-3\"></a>Team</h2>\n<p>The Event Horizon Team first began publishing work in July 2023. They have an active Discord and have been very responsive to user questions there and in other community forums. They have an active <a href=\"https://docs.eventhorizon.vote/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documentation site</a> which highlights their projects including DAO token staking. They have also written several blog articles about DAO governance on their blog.</p>\n<p>The Event Horizon team has been operating and participating in DAO voting for over a year. They have also recently received large-scale delegations from communities such as <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin</a>. It’s important to note that some of their <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/24#specification-6\">stated claims</a> of performance in other DAOs is based on voting activity, not total delegations. For example, they claim to be the “10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem” but they are only the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/delegates\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">108th largest delegate listed on Tally</a>. We point out this distinction to ensure that readers do not conflate active voter with total delegation rankings. The Event Horizon team also provided further clarification on the terminology used:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“voter” and “delegate” are clearly completely different terms. The clarification being a highlight that we don’t say “delegate” we say “voter” and voter is different than delegate. Many delegates have never voted. Aave as an example, the vast majority of the largest delegates are not <em>voters</em>. Again, given most large delegates haven’t voted or are “ghost delegates”, “voter” is the salient metric.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe encourage Arbitrum community members to be familiar with the team behind this proposal and fully understand the context and claims of their past performance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"code-documentation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#code-documentation-4\"></a>Code &amp; Documentation</h2>\n<p>The proposal’s voting system as described needs to aggregate votes and submit them on-chain by the described logic. All of this occurs today off-chain by code that is currently unavailable for scrutiny. The Event Horizon team did inform us that their architecture utilizes the <a href=\"https://docs.snapshot.org/tools/snapshot.js\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a> and <a href=\"https://apidocs.tally.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tally</a> SDK &amp; APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nOpenZeppelin believes strongly in the trust that comes from on-chain deployments and largely eschews projects where the code is not available. We encourage Event Horizon to deploy all of their voting logic on-chain and/or open up their architecture for public scrutiny before it goes live for usage on Arbitrum delegations. The Event Horizon stated their intent to address this recommendation with the following response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding documentation of off-chain systems, we’ll include it in our public documentation and make it easily visible from our web client.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is one component that is on mainnet: the required voter pass. It is an upgradeable contract and its source code is hosted <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/hvaxlaunch/blob/main/contracts/HVAXVoterCard.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. Relevant addresses are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voter Pass Proxy Contract: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4E911626Fa378cC95fB1A26Cc272c070eF79e4b7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>0x4E911626Fa378cC95fB1A26Cc272c070eF79e4b7</code></a></li>\n<li>Voter Pass Implementation Contract: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x68fecd506273714b25b0293f26dc40e5fc041c28\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>0x68fECD506273714B25B0293F26dC40E5fc041c28</code></a></li>\n<li>Voter Pass Owner: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xFAD69Bd739c64cC8e3f1C3bb3B60fe4f160174Cc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>0xFAD69Bd739c64cC8e3f1C3bb3B60fe4f160174Cc</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposal requires the development of an Arbitrum-specific <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/franchiser\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">“franchiser”</a> contract which allows the DAO to control the delegated tokens. Event Horizon references an existing Uniswap version that was reportedly audited by Trail of Bits. That audit report has not been published but the results are reportedly available as GitHub issues <a href=\"https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%28TOB\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe recommend that the Franchiser contract be subjected to a security audit before being deployed (as is suggested by the Event Horizon proposal). This could be conducted through either the Arbitrum Foundation or with OpenZeppelin directly as a member of the ARDC. In any case, the audit should be completed and published before any delegations are assigned.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-access-control-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#security-access-control-5\"></a>Security &amp; Access Control</h2>\n<p>The currently deployed <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4E911626Fa378cC95fB1A26Cc272c070eF79e4b7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Voter Pass contract</a> previously mentioned has a <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xFAD69Bd739c64cC8e3f1C3bb3B60fe4f160174Cc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">single EOA</a> as its owner and is upgradable without a timelock. If the Owner EOA were to be compromised, it could be used to manipulate delegated votes.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe recommend that Event Horizon use an M-of-N multi-sig for any ownership roles in the Voter Pass contract and any other contracts that impact Arbitrum delegations. We also recommend that the Event Horizon team consider implementing a timelock for upgradable contracts and/or make public commitments for how upgrades will be performed in a safe and transparent manner. Regarding the Multi-sig, the Event Horizon team stated their intent to address this recommendation with the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the VoterPass ownership - I think that’s a good recommendation. We will change to a Multi-Sig.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the tokens are to be delegated and not outright transferred, there should be no risk of losing custodial control of the 7M $ARB as long as the Franchiser contract is secure. The worst-case risk aside from Event Horizon’s accounts being compromised, is if Event Horizon acts as a bad-faith delegate and allocates the votes contrary to how they promised.</p>\n<p>In these cases, Event Horizon states that an <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523\">Oversight Committee</a> multi-sig made up of “5 existing, notable delegates” will have ownership control over the Franchiser contract where delegations are received which will enable them to veto votes. However, Event Horizon <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/9\">later stated</a> that this Oversight Committee will only be able to force Event Horizon delegations to abstain from a vote and nothing else.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to note that the Event Horizon team states that the Oversight Committee will only have 24 hours to veto decisions “between the closing of the Event Horizon proposal, and the underlying DAO’s proposal”. It could be challenging for a 3-of-5 multisig to identify a vote that should be vetoed and sign a transaction within this 24 hour period, although the Oversight Committee could still enact a veto anytime prior to the the closing of the Event Horizon proposal if a problem was detected early-on.</p>\n<p>The current setup in the <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/franchiser/blob/f91fff5face262a2306576a9e0b49c257d131f4a/src/Franchiser.sol#L195\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Franchiser contract</a> allows the Owner role to recall delegations, which may be desirable if the Event Horizon system is ever compromised or the voter pools begin acting in bad-faith. When discussing this mechanic with the Event Horizon team, they stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While the proposal doesn’t explicitly state that the DAO can undelegate, we think it’s a useful function to allow the DAO to undelegate through the OC (Oversight Committee) should they wish. The OC would operate through the DAO for this. To clarify: the OC cannot remove delegation per the constraints of the proposal. even though they technically can. a kosher removal of delegation would first have to be approved by the DAO on tally and then can be carried out by the OC</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe recommend that Arbitrum delegates carefully think through the responsibility and powers of the Oversight Committee to manage the delegations to Event Horizon. We recommend a greater time window than 24 hours for the Oversight Committee to make vetos and that the powers to recall delegations also be retained in the Franchiser contract for emergency scenarios. We encourage a careful selection process for delegates to serve on the Oversight Committee to ensure they can actively monitor and manage the delegations assigned to Event Horizon and respond to potential issues.</p>\n<p>Overall, it’s important to emphasize that the Oversight Committee serves a critical function of managing the ARB delegations to Event Horizon and would be the DAO’s primary responder to any security or governance issues that might arise. All other access control permissions maintained by the Event Horizon team in other contracts should be protected and restricted to minimize their potential impact over the ARB delegations.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-6\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>We’ve provided several important security recommendations here that we encourage the Event Horizon team to implement in their system to enhance the system’s transparency and security stance before deploying any contracts to be used for ARB delegations. We have also highlighted several risks and concerns that Arbitrum delegators should consider in their decisions regarding the Event Horizon proposal as well as the selection for the Oversight Committee. We are happy to engage in further discussion and questions in the forum.</p>\n<p>For more information on OpenZeppelin’s role as Security Member of ARDC, please visit our <a

what it was able to produce.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was from these two incidents that I decided to do something about this</p>\n<p>Initially, I wrote my own code generation tool for foundry, which would set

name=\"context-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#context-1\"></a>Context:</h1>\n<p>This proposal picks up from the conversations we had in Denver and 6 weeks of running the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI) Working Group, including weekly workshops, async conversations, and multiple 1-1s with delegates.</p>\n<p>We’ve confirmed existing pain points within the community, formulated an overall vision for the Arbitrum Venture Initiative, developed a high-level strategy for deployment, and started aligning with interested parties.</p>\n<p>We are planning to submit a pilot phase proposal for a Snapshot vote this week based on all the feedback received so far, with a focus on developing a concrete strategy (thesis) for funds deployment and test case with allocators (VCs and other programs) while advancing stakeholder alignment. This will enable the initiative to launch successfully once the appropriate legal setup is ready and avoid delays leading to significant opportunity costs for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We want to make sure to highlight our commitment to integrate the work that we are doing into any larger construct/umbrella that the DAO decides on if this should materialize and not create any conflicting workstreams. As well as to make all the learnings and insights produced available to the DAO or Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p>Further context in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-proposal-non-constitutional-establishment-of-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-avi/23222\">original AVI proposal</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/announcing-the-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-working-group/23012\">AVI workgroup thread</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>Our team’s mission is to enable the Arbitrum DAO to boost the development and financial sustainability by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>defining an effective approach for ArbitrumDAO to setup an Ecosystem Fund that would fund ventures aligned with the ecosystem through venture programs (e.g. VCs, venture builders, accelerators, etc.) and direct investing;</li>\n<li>and then executing on the said approach.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal is focused on a ‘pilot sprint’, where we’ll:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Facilitate an IRL thesis development event and series of online workshops leading up to it, together with experts and the key stakeholders to develop the thesis and strategy in agreed-upon target areas for venture programs;</li>\n<li>In parallel do a market consultation with at least 30 founders and 15 funds, to test how the market sees the opportunity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The learnings and resulting thesis will be documented in a report to equip the delegates and group working on the thesis with the relevant insights.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"why-conduct-a-pilot-sprint-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#why-conduct-a-pilot-sprint-3\"></a>Why conduct a pilot sprint?</h1>\n<p>Operating AVI represents a bold and pioneering initiative for blockchain ecosystems and as such it is also a complex undertaking that involves high capital needs. It also is one of several such in the Arbitrum DAO that require complex stakeholder alignment around setting up legal and governance structures. Thus, it is not appropriate to rush it before the relevant structures have been put in place.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there is a significant opportunity cost in not progressing with good velocity on at least the components that can already clearly be acted on. A lean and pragmatic pilot phase to analyze key themes thoroughly and develop the necessary clarity will provide us with a solid foundation to build on.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"pilot-sprint-approach-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pilot-sprint-approach-4\"></a>Pilot sprint approach</h1>\n<p>The pilot sprint outputs intend to provide the DAO delegates and stakeholders with sufficient information to decide on advancing the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI), or parts of it into the next phase of development, including its operationalisation and funding requirements. The sprint is designed to fund the operational team for 8-weeks long and is the natural progression of our existing Working Group efforts. As well as hosting a series of activities, workshops and an IRL thesis development event. The later would run before the 8 week sprint and and after it shaping up an overall timeline of up to 18 weeks depending on the approval date and scheduling constraints of various stakeholders.</p>\n<p>The sprint will kick off in-depth research and workshops to identify opportunity areas (thesis development).</p>\n<p>The pilot sprint will provide concrete data and analysis from various ecosystem participants and stakeholders. Armed with this information, we will have the strategic perspective (thesis development) ready for AVI’s operation.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"key-output-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-output-5\"></a>Key Output</h1>\n<p>An in-depth report detailing a shared, well-researched understanding in the Arbitrum community of where the opportunities related to investment lie.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Expected Outcomes</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Equip the DAO delegates and community participants with a deeper shared understanding about a strategy and approach to a coordinated and optimized horizontal strategy for Ecosystem funding and venture development.</li>\n<li>Align the DAO on strategic targets by providing strategic analysis and coordinating key stakeholders and delegates.</li>\n<li>Provide a platform for open discussion as well as active collaboration as we advance towards the next phase of the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI).</li>\n<li>Engage a broad range of builders, capital allocators and talent around new ventures and value creation related to Arbitrum, while embedding their needs and ideas with deep empathy in future design.</li>\n<li>Produce general exposure and community engagement.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\nDeliverables\n<ol>\n<li>3 market opportunity mapping workshops (online)*A.</li>\n<li>3 Briefs for Delegates to prepare for the Thesis Building Event</li>\n<li>1 AVI Thesis Building event where key experts related to the thesis will be invited (1-day event in London / 20-40 ppl).*B</li>\n<li>1 public evening event (on the same day as the thesis event), during which key insights and talks will be presented including a bigger community (80 - 120 ppl). *C</li>\n<li>30 interviews with builders.</li>\n<li>15 interviews with General Partners and other fund managers from various ecosystems</li>\n<li>A Synthesis Market Consultation Report summarizing key challenges and opportunity areas that the VC funding should address. *D</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<p>A* Examples of thesis exploration ideas that would be discussed during the online workshops and honed down on during the IRL event. DeSci and DePIN are two important current trends. DeSci is interesting from an Arbitrum perspective, among other reasons, because it naturally requires handling a lot of data and transactions on chains. DePIN solutions are relevant in that regard, however as things stand at present it is likely that a lot of these applications might get scattered across different L2s. In that case this would make them computationally inefficient, as they would have to work via the L1. But if a well considered cluster of such applications get attracted to Arbitrum this can create a particularly powerful network effect, making the natural place for such a well defined category. This is an example of a type of scenario that can benefit from being studied in depth to inform a thoughtful ecosystem investment strategy. While this is not necessarily the particular focus being proposed, it illustrates the sort of areas of exploration that might require the attraction of a diverse group of experts. Some of whom might not yet be natively in the Arbitrum ecosystem or in Web3 altogether.**</p>\n<p>B* Location: The Farstar team favors doing the above work in London, where we have access to a  broad engaged community to pull experts from. And our team has access to a variety of excellent locations that we can make use of. That being said our team is keen to maintain flexibility to run on another location if more accessible for key Arbitrum stakeholders as well as leverage EthCC in the build up to the event.</p>\n<p>C* While the purpose of the event is to be optimized for the participation of effective delegates and other key stakeholders, which implies making it more intimate. In the evening after the event we would like to make this said central location open for the broader interested community and allow some of the ideas coming from it to spread creating visibility and excitement for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Photo from a recent Web3 unconference our team ran in a venue we might use:<br>\n</p><div class=\"large-image-placeholder\"><a href=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3sWT28U2R9hgG-ZFa-eMaMKV4ADjDLcXXV_xCv6ZXxk3l0N17pSzIUtLbedSeTxtRg_jtBd_-F-N2KjO_8zTS4E3cDi0rYejxcL0e6pZfzF2XeHC2Muy68363_L_bfIr5ko8gS0oxTfebDmNV0sHvXk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"url\">https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3sWT28U2R9hgG-ZFa-eMaMKV4ADjDLcXXV_xCv6ZXxk3l0N17pSzIUtLbedSeTxtRg_jtBd_-F-N2KjO_8zTS4E3cDi0rYejxcL0e6pZfzF2XeHC2Muy68363_L_bfIr5ko8gS0oxTfebDmNV0sHvXk</span><span class=\"help\">(image larger than 4 MB)</span></a></div><p></p>\n<p>D* Here is an example report that was produced by Konstantina recently: <a href=\"https://www.fmfib.bg/media/20240314_Doklad_za_pazaren_test_FIP_i_FTT_clean_EN.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.fmfib.bg/media/20240314_Doklad_za_pazaren_test_FIP_i_FTT_clean_EN.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Our team appreciates that a different format of the deliverable might be more appropriate in the context and will consult delegates and the community to adjust accordingly.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"team-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#team-6\"></a>Team</h2>\n<p>We bring deep expertise in investing (web3 and VC), working with early-stage builders and in ecosystem building (Development VC) around frontier topics and emerging technologies.

Scope of coverage included mainly private mergers and acquisition deals. Throughout investment banking career he covered deals with total value in excess of c. 2bnUSD. Was actively involved within blockchain markets since 2016 conducting research and running own investments. Current scope of responsibilities includes analysis and coverage of DAO governance.</p>\n<p><strong>3.Total team size: 7 + affiliated dev team (20)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4.Number of Years in Operation: 5</strong></p>\n<p><strong>III. Applicant Performance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5.Past experience if any for performing each of the roles and responsibilities described in the appendix (Divide your answer into three sections corresponding to the 3 parts in the appendix).</strong></p>\n<p>The Avantgarde team has relevant previous experience as full time capital allocators to third party fund managers within traditional finance, including building &amp; overseeing institutional grade investment and operational due diligence processes for selecting and monitoring external investment vehicles.</p>\n<p><strong>Cashflow and Accrual Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>The team have previous experience with monitoring cash flows of external mutual fund structures within traditional portfolios, including the monitoring of 9 figure dollar allocations into US Dollar prime and government money market funds for large family offices. This included working with fund managers, fund administrators, and custodians in reconciling fund positions and dividend payments from underlying fund allocations.</p>\n<p>Because of our background with Enzyme and having worked with other DAOs in the space we have accumulated a wealth of experience when it comes to DeFi reporting, cashflow tracking and reporting. We have the ability to automate processes where necessary and can very confidently tackle any on-chain challenges. Some examples of our on-chain work include working with oracles and on-chain NAV calculations, token valuation, reconciliation of accounts (or asset management performance), management &amp; performance fee calculations and automation of processes (eg. reporting for on-chain funds and DAOs).</p>\n<p><strong>Underlying Asset Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>Previously as institutional allocators to third party fund managers within traditional finance, members of the team have over a decade of experience managing segregated accounts of external asset managers for large institutional clients, including day to day monitoring at both the asset class and fund level. Within this experience, members of our team have also built institutional grade quantitative portfolio monitoring tools for breaking down risk exposures from portfolio holdings and returns data across multiple asset classes and fund universes.</p>\n<p>The Avantgarde team also has a strong background in on-chain asset monitoring within DeFi. This includes monitoring of positions within our on-chain funds, monitoring assets for 3rd party protocols for factors which may lead to mispricing (eg., depegs, market depth, etc) and portfolio weights (rebalancing needs).</p>\n<p><strong>Operations and Counterparty Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>The team have experience conducting operational due diligence both with centralised entities, including across fund manager service providers such as administrators, custodians, lawyers, risk management services. We’re also able to identify risk factors to monitor and set up internal processes to track and react.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde have conducted operational due diligence on smart contracts as part of integration work for Enzyme, an on-chain asset management protocol that has been running since 2018 without being exposed to any significant exploits. Operational work on Enzyme integrations includes rigorous testing, including on fund flows and redemptions from vaults, and encompasses working with external smart contract auditors. Additionally, we have conducted operational due diligence and monitoring within the Ethereum node operator space, including service level agreements around slashing and forgone staking rewards for example.</p>\n<p>On the interaction of smart contracts, legal fund structures, and fund management service providers, Avantgarde has a unique perspective in operating fund vehicles run on blockchain rails and the nuances in integrating smart contracts with legal contracts across the fund management stack.</p>\n<p><strong>6.Describe any conflicts of interest your entity, its investors or key personnel may have with any potential service providers selected under the program</strong></p>\n<p>We have a broad client base with both TradFi and DeFi players. We currently don’t see any conflicts of interest but we are happy to disclose any that may come up publicly as and when they do.</p>\n<p>It is also worth highlighting the importance of an independent risk and monitoring function, which is often separate from investment teams who select allocations. Since Avantgarde was not part of the screening committee for the service providers, we feel we are in a good position to act in an unbiased way in monitoring the providers selected, and can provide an additional independent level of oversight beyond the opinions provided at the screening stage.</p>\n<p><strong>7.Under what situations would you make a recommendation for Arbitrum to withdraw its assets from a selected service provider to fulfil each aspect of the outlined scope in the appendix?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a wide variety of reasons for redeeming from a provider, and whilst significant material issues are often evident in net performance figures, in our experience more subtle issues from a risk perspective often require a mosaic of quantitative and qualitative factors to pick up before the fact. In our view, this is also likely to be the case in monitoring for the STEP program - whilst we have no visibility into the final service providers which will be selected, within the money market fund fund categories (which is where the underlying strategies of many of the applicants belong) there is little performance dispersion because of the tight constraints of money market fund regulation on eligible securities, weighted average life, weighted average maturity, and liquidity.</p>\n<p>As program manager we would look to develop a holistic forward looking view based on other factors that could impact the repeatability of past performance, including: deviations in portfolio exposures, turnover in key personnel, irregularities at the smart contract level, data inconsistencies between centralised sources, relevant changes for the provider at the firm &amp; regulatory levels, amongst others. A key point is that no single indicator is a silver bullet, and we believe a significant part of effective monitoring is in being able to identify the causes for material changes - crucially, effective monitoring requires the ability to differentiate between 1) the inherent noise that is present in all aspects of external portfolio surveillance, and 2) genuine signals that arise when incremental uncertainty becomes significant enough to warrant action.</p>\n<p>There may also be other exogenous factors to consider for withdrawing from a project, such as diversification considerations at the overall level or where a project’s alignment with the Arbitrum ecosystem evolves in a way that is not consistent with the longer term goals of the STEP program.</p>\n<p><strong>8.Please list any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organisational structures</strong></p>\n<p>Avantgarde has worked with leading protocols including Uniswap, Apecoin, The Graph, Arbitrum, Nexus Mutual, Paraswap, Enzyme and others. DAOs leverage Avantgarde’s combined expertise in protocol development and asset management for developing strategies to improve treasury sustainability. Avantgarde has been involved with Arbitrum’s Treasury &amp; Sustainability Working Group since the early stages, including the production of a study focusing on how traditional asset classes, accessed via real world assets, can reduce risk within DAO treasuries which played a role in the evolution of the STEP program to where it is today - <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-research-risk-reduction-in-dao-treasuries/20662/2\">link</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>9.What is the value of assets monitored by your entity?</strong></p>\n<p>Provided by email</p>\n<p><strong>10.Can you explain how risk management (investment and operational) is being done for assets under monitoring?</strong></p>\n<p>Avantgarde currently performs risk management from a number of perspectives. On it’s asset management strategies, the investment thesis for each holding is reassessed on a continuous basis to ensure the quantitative and qualitative factors for inclusion have not materially changed. This includes monitoring flags on key on-chain and off-chain risk metrics. A few of the metrics which are deemed time critical have pre-trade approval when they hit certain thresholds, enabling action to be taken on the position when triggered. Other metrics flag major changes that require further investigation, in conjunction with other data analysis or by speaking to related project teams. The team will also monitor related social channels such as twitter and discord for related announcements and changes to protocols. Where applicable, periodic reviews with underlying project teams are performed, including refreshing qualitative or proprietary information that is not available on-chain to ensure documentation is up to date.</p>\n<p><strong>11.Describe the content, format and preparation process of performance reports. This should include details of interest earned and status of total assets. Provide a sample if available.</strong></p>\n<p>Reports should be tailored based on the portfolio/product. The content of the report will be dependent on the specific product. Typical performance reports for money market related products will include: yield over multiple horizons (1 day, 7 days, 30 days), fund and firm level assets under management, portfolio breakdown by major asset types (such as overnight repo and treasury bills), breakdown by maturity buckets, weighted average life, weighted average maturity, daily and weekly maturing assets as % of the fund, and token prices by major price sources. The reports and corresponding updates to the Arbitrum governance forums should also be customised to include requested information from the foundation and DAO community, such as total interest earned.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Applicant Pricing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>12.Provide a copy of your standard contract, or one similar to what is being proposed here.</strong><br>\nProvided by e-mail</p>\n<p><strong>13.Comprehensive pricing breakdown inclusive of the full scope of services requested</strong><br>\nProvided by e-mail</p>\n<p><strong>14.Terms of fee payment such as upfront vs monthly costs</strong><br>\nProvided by e-mail</p>\n<p><strong>15.Approximate percentage of your annual budget that this service contract would constitute ?

This significant transition has moved all grant contracts and proposals under Arbitrum, streamlining donor contributions and matching fund payouts through this platform for Gitcoin’s 20th quarterly grants round.</p>\n<p>This initiative has already drawn approximately <a href=\"https://grants.gitcoin.co/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">35,000 users</a>, many of whom are new to the community, and generated approximately 5 million on-chain transactions. With over $1.5 million in matching funds available, the transaction volume exceeded $2 million equivalent on ARB.</p>\n<p>The application period for these opportunities opened on April 2nd and closed on April 16th. The donation phase began on April 23rd and will run until May 7th. Thrive Protocol is supercharging the Gitcoin grants round, aiming to create a flywheel effect where strategic rewards and the assessment of impact together generate epic wins for our community. These<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thank-arb-get-rewarded-for-contributing-to-gitcoin-grants-20/23451\"> strategic rewards</a> have been designed for diverse roles within the community, from builders and promoters to curators, to boost involvement and attract top talent to our ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Key initiatives include the Thank ARB Builders Bonus and substantial rewards for hosting engaging Twitter Spaces. The goal of these efforts is to expand community engagement, increase transaction volumes, and promote wider adoption of the Arbitrum infrastructure. This synergistic approach is enhancing the vitality and reach of the Arbitrum ecosystem during this grant round and beyond.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ha3zD7rrngTE3yjwjKDtk2Gjv2G.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a_2_624x351.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ha3zD7rrngTE3yjwjKDtk2Gjv2G\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a_2_624x351.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a_2_936x526.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"323231\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-2-oversight-board-milestone-delivery-tracking-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-oversight-board-milestone-delivery-tracking-6\"></a>2.

The protocol’s liquidity is driven by a hybrid model that combines a unified central limit order book with an integrated automated market maker. This liquidity is further enhanced by pairwise market making vaults powered by <a href=\"https://www.elixir.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Elixir</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overview-4\"></a>Overview</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"vertex-liquidity-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-liquidity-5\"></a>Vertex Liquidity</h3>\n<p><strong>Orderbook:</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex’s orderbook, called <a href=\"https://edge.vertexprotocol.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Edge</a>, operates as an off-chain node layered on top of the smart contracts and contained within the Arbitrum protocol layer.  Edge creates a central hub of liquidity which can be consumed by instances on different chains concurrently.  As a result, Edge is capable of matching inbound orders from one chain with the combined orderbook liquidity of all of the base layers plugged into the Vertex sequencer.</p>\n<p>Both sides of the trade are filled out, and the sequencer (Edge) takes the opposite side of the inbound trades — automatically hedging and rebalancing liquidity on the back-end between chains.</p>\n<p>Notably, the sequencer only mirrors resting liquidity (e.g., maker orders) across the sharded states of the Vertex Edge instances on different base layers. Taker orders remain unchanged, and are submitted directly from an independent Vertex Edge instance, such as Vertex Arbitrum, to the sequencer’s unified liquidity layer.</p>\n<p>Vertex charges a flat fee for interactions with the Vertex Sequencer, denominated in USDC, to compensate for the gas paid to the underlying blockchain while allowing for a faster trading experience via lightning-fast order matching.</p>\n<p>Edge is significant because it eliminates user costs for placing market orders that consume liquidity during the STIP program’s duration. Fees for withdrawal, liquidation, and minting/burning of LP tokens will still apply. Being off-chain, Edge also constitutes an external dependency for both the Vertex smart contracts and the Arbitrum ecosystem. Should Edge experience downtime, Vertex will rely solely on the AMM for spot liquidity, and the perpetual market liquidity will cease.</p>\n<p><strong>AMM:</strong></p>\n<p>The pooled liquidity of the AMM is integrated with the bids and asks on the Vertex spot order book. This AMM liquidity is combined with liquidity from automated traders facilitated by the sequencer, creating a unified source of liquidity against which users can trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex Universal Cross Margin</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex user’s margin is shared across all spot, perpetual and money market positions.  The improved capital efficiency of this differentiates Vertex from other single product exchanges.</p>\n<p>This is apparent in the ease that arbitrageurs can monetize Vertex funding rates completely within the protocol, accessing leverage from the money market and offsetting positions from the spot DEX.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex External Interactions</strong></p>\n<p>The Vertex Protocol is mostly self-contained, being primarily focused on perpetual futures trading.  The two major external touch points are with the <a href=\"https://www.elixir.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Elixir Network</a> as the liquidity strategies powering Vertex liquidity vaults, and <a href=\"https://docs.vertexprotocol.com/getting-started/vertex-edge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vertex Edge</a> as the cross-chain liquidity engine running as an off-chain component.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"use-of-incentives-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#use-of-incentives-6\"></a>Use of Incentives</h1>\n<p>Vertex deployed all ARB incentives to boost trading volumes across its spot and perpetual markets. As the platform primarily concentrates on trading activity, it is reasonable that the perpetual markets will attract the bulk of this activity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"trading-rewards-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trading-rewards-7\"></a><strong>Trading Rewards</strong>:</h2>\n<p>Rewards on trading fees are capped at up to 75% of the taker fee paid. However, this percentage may be lower if the fees paid exceed 133% of the dollar amount of allocated weekly incentives (approximately $200k initially). In such cases, incentives are distributed proportionally to the fees paid. Conversely, if the fees paid are less than 133% of the dollar amount of allocated weekly incentives, then the full allocated amount is not utilized. The unused portion is then carried over to the following week.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"incentivize-community-based-market-making-elixir-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentivize-community-based-market-making-elixir-8\"></a><strong>Incentivize Community-Based Market-Making (Elixir)</strong>:</h2>\n<p>Vertex launched Elixir’s Fusion Pools on its platform at the beginning of the STIP, setting a baseline annual percentage rate (APR) from ARB incentives at 15%. If the total value locked (TVL) in these pools does not reach the maximum capacity at any time, the remaining incentives will be carried over to the following week.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"other-uses-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#other-uses-9\"></a><strong>Other Uses</strong></h2>\n<p>Vertex also removed sequencer fees for takers interacting with Vertex Edge for the duration of the program.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pace-of-spending-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pace-of-spending-10\"></a><strong>Pace of Spending</strong></h2>\n<p>In early January, the Arbitrum DAO voted to extend the deadline for spending incentives from January 31 to February 29. Vertex responded by reducing the weekly incentive disbursements, allowing the funds to stretch over an extended period.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"vertex-incentives-impact-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-incentives-impact-11\"></a>Vertex Incentives Impact</h1>\n<p>The objective of this impact assessment is to evaluate the effects of the incentive program on protocol activity, specifically examining the demand for trading liquidity (takers) and the supply provided by Fusion vaults. This detailed, bottom-up analysis scrutinizes individual components of the STIP, which are unique to Vertex.  This allows a clear prescription of how this results of the program were obtained and how this could be applied to other protocols.</p>\n<p>Despite the STIP program’s short-term nature, this report assesses its prolonged benefits by analyzing protocol usage data following the program’s conclusion.  The intention is to identify persistent activity changes, and what drove them.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of Vertex’s incentives is thoroughly examined across various dimensions, initiating with a comprehensive analysis of trader reactions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Were the incentives appealing to new traders?</li>\n<li>How effectively were traders retained?</li>\n<li>What impact did the incentives have on traders’ average trading volumes, and how does this vary across different trader categories?</li>\n<li>How these individual trader changes drove overall trading volumes?</li>\n<li>How were traders’ demands for exposure affected?</li>\n<li>What was the effect on overall TVL, segmented by token category?</li>\n<li>How did this activity influence other Arbitrum uses, such as blockspace demand?</li>\n<li>Did this stimulate additional trading activity on Arbitrum, or did it cannibalize existing activity?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, the impact of liquidity incentives intended to bootstrap Fusion pools is evaluated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How swiftly did liquidity reach the pools’ cap?</li>\n<li>Was this liquidity sticky after the incentives ended?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of the incentives is also analyzed to gain insight into the structural efficiency of this program.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"trader-reactions-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trader-reactions-12\"></a>Trader Reactions</h2>\n<p>Throughout this section a trader is defined as a unique subaccount on Vertex.  This will likely differ from the number of human traders, but serves as a useful proxy.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"new-trader-acquisition-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-trader-acquisition-13\"></a><strong>New Trader Acquisition</strong></h3>\n<p>Throughout the STIP, 5,764 new traders executed at least one taker order on Vertex, only marginally more than the 5,208 new traders in the prior four months. At first glance, it appears that the Vertex STIP’s fee rebate structure did not greatly influence new trader acquisition. However, several other factors must be considered.</p>\n<p>The period before the STIP likely saw sybil activity aiming to benefit from the VRTX TGE in November 2023. This probably inflated the count of actual human traders far more than during the STIP when sybil activity had no advantage.</p>\n<p>The incentives from competing trading platforms also play a crucial role. Two other exchanges received significantly larger STIP grants than Vertex, potentially making trader acquisition harder during this time.</p>\n<p>The rise in new traders after the program ended suggests that acquiring new traders did not decelerate post-program.</p>\n<p>We conclude that Vertex’s fee rebates moderately impacted trader acquisition. Due to the challenges in accounting for competing protocol incentives and prior airdrop farming, the exact impact remains uncertain and warrants further investigation, considering the competitive ecosystem.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d0a876361a311dec7fb01bb320a2c4c9c615cf27.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/tLSeYo3r2CjDme1ec6vbiLGPfMz.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Vertex Monthly Active Traders\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d0a876361a311dec7fb01bb320a2c4c9c615cf27_2_684x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Vertex Monthly Active Traders\" data-base62-sha1=\"tLSeYo3r2CjDme1ec6vbiLGPfMz\" width=\"684\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d0a876361a311dec7fb01bb320a2c4c9c615cf27_2_684x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d0a876361a311dec7fb01bb320a2c4c9c615cf27_2_1026x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d0a876361a311dec7fb01bb320a2c4c9c615cf27_2_1368x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1E272A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"trader-retention-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trader-retention-14\"></a>Trader Retention</h3>\n<p>The monthly retention rate at Vertex is defined as the percentage of traders who engaged in at least one trade in the previous month and continued to trade in the current month.</p>\n<p>Vertex has experienced a steady improvement in its monthly retention rate throughout its operational history, contributing to signs of compounding user growth over time.</p>\n<p>The noticeable decline in December is primarily attributed to the large number of new traders joining Vertex during the initial month of the STIP, and is regarded as a temporary anomaly. Subsequently, the monthly retention rate has resumed its upward trend.</p>\n<p>Our analysis concludes that traders involved in Vertex during the STIP have shown reasonable retention levels. There is no evidence to suggest that the program was predominantly exploited by short-term, opportunistic traders. The rebate mechanism has successfully attracted long-term traders who continue to use the platform even after the incentive period has ended.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e01657208ff5d360890a73176ee16939319afe0b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vYmOFQUAXooJgS1OalIMJfXZ2wr.png?dl=1\" title=\"Monthly Retention Rate\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e01657208ff5d360890a73176ee16939319afe0b.png\" alt=\"Monthly Retention Rate\" data-base62-sha1=\"vYmOFQUAXooJgS1OalIMJfXZ2wr\" width=\"690\" height=\"450\" data-dominant-color=\"1A1E21\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"existing-trader-activity-growth-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#existing-trader-activity-growth-15\"></a>Existing Trader Activity Growth</h3>\n<p>There is a clear correlation between the incentives offered and the average monthly trading volume per trader, which began to diverge in January 2024.

This change coincided with the decision to reduce weekly trading incentives by half to extend their duration until the new end date in February.</p>\n<p>This pattern indicates that while trading volume is highly responsive to the rate of incentives, open interest is considerably more stable.

The median trader gradually increased their trade size over the duration of the STIP, followed by a significant reduction, with early signs of recovery in April. This segment shows limited elasticity to incentives, with no noticeable increase at the program’s outset or sustained drop at its conclusion.</p>\n<p>The 75th percentile trader saw rapid increases in trading volume until the incentives were reduced in January. This segment appears most responsive to fee rebates, with trading volumes reverting to initial levels immediately after the STIP concluded, and no significant increase in April.</p>\n<p>Small to mid-sized trading firms showed trends similar to the power retail segment but were less sensitive to changes in incentives. Their trading volumes did not decline immediately after the incentive reduction in January.

Their volumes have since rebounded, suggesting that the STIP had a highly positive impact on their activity.

Here the change in TVL due to price changes is defined as $\\Delta TVL_{price} = \\sum{TVL^i_0 \\times (P^i_T - P^i_0)}$, and the change in TVL  due to incremental activity as $\\Delta TVL_{new} = \\sum{P^i_T \\times (TVL^i_T - TVL_0^i)}$.</p>\n<p>$P^i_0$ represents the price at time 0 of token i, and similarly</p>\n<p>$TVL^i_T$ represents the TVL at time T of token i</p>\n<p>Time 0 corresponds with the beginning of the STIP program and T with the end.</p>\n<p>The results show that despite the price increases over the program, the vast majority of the increase in TVL can be attributed to net new flows into the clearinghouse.

While TVL across Arbitrum increased by approximately $250 million, Vertex contributed about 20% to this growth. Notably, Vertex’s TVL expanded ten times faster than the average for other Arbitrum exchanges in percentage terms. Given the consistent direction of growth and its modest share of the total increase, it is evident that Vertex’s growth is predominantly organic and represents new TVL.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Vertex’s TVL performance is impressive relative to the broader ecosystem. Despite a general decrease in interest for leveraged trading and the end of incentives, Vertex’s TVL has remained near its highs, whereas the industry generally has fallen by 20%. This resilience suggests that Vertex’s focus on incentivizing organic activity through rebates is creating sustainable outcomes.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e0f1b2ee6a9e52a8403c62bbdc26d6afe96107cf.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/w5WN2zWmPV4tp9wsq4UGmeIWewD.png?dl=1\" title=\"Vertex's TVL performance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e0f1b2ee6a9e52a8403c62bbdc26d6afe96107cf_2_690x118.png\" alt=\"Vertex's TVL performance\" data-base62-sha1=\"w5WN2zWmPV4tp9wsq4UGmeIWewD\" width=\"690\" height=\"118\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e0f1b2ee6a9e52a8403c62bbdc26d6afe96107cf_2_690x118.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e0f1b2ee6a9e52a8403c62bbdc26d6afe96107cf_2_1035x177.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e0f1b2ee6a9e52a8403c62bbdc26d6afe96107cf_2_1380x236.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"202428\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/61ca0847bba2eee0c81a25db9facac029ab0ae6a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dX5alHoKkTO9mft2RLrdfhNeF8m.png?dl=1\" title=\"Arbitrum Perpetual Futures TVL\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/61ca0847bba2eee0c81a25db9facac029ab0ae6a_2_664x500.png\" alt=\"Arbitrum Perpetual Futures TVL\" data-base62-sha1=\"dX5alHoKkTO9mft2RLrdfhNeF8m\" width=\"664\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/61ca0847bba2eee0c81a25db9facac029ab0ae6a_2_664x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/61ca0847bba2eee0c81a25db9facac029ab0ae6a_2_996x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/61ca0847bba2eee0c81a25db9facac029ab0ae6a.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1B1F22\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"vertex-liquidity-reaction-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-liquidity-reaction-20\"></a>Vertex Liquidity Reaction</h2>\n<p>The initial $3m cap for Vertex Fusion Vaults powered by Elixir was hit on the first day.  The subsequent $10m cap was hit within 2 days and remained within 15% of this cap throughout the STIP and beyond.  It is reasonable to conclude that the assigned incentives were at least high enough to bootstrap this liquidity.</p>\n<p>The vaults have subsequently increased in size with TVL remaining after STIP incentives ended, confirming the sustained benefit of bootstrapping these pools.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"vertex-incentive-distribution-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-incentive-distribution-21\"></a>Vertex Incentive Distribution</h2>\n<p>One notable aspect of the Vertex STIP incentives is that 53% of the incentives have been claimed by just two accounts. While it is common for trading volumes on venues to be highly concentrated among the most active traders, this level of concentration is unusually high.</p>\n<p>To obtain an objective metric for the concentration of incentives distributed, we use the Herfindahl-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hirschman Index (HHI)</a>.  The HHI is a common measure of market concentration, typically applied to firms in an industry.  It applies well to the distribution of incentives as Vertex can be seen as a marketplace with individual traders transaction on it.  The resulting index is generally interpreted as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An HHI of less than 1,500 is considered a competitive marketplace</li>\n<li>An HHI of 1,500 to 2,500 is moderately concentrated</li>\n<li>An HHI of 2,500 or greater is highly concentrated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for the Vertex incentives stands at 1475, which is considered competitive. Beyond the two largest claimants, there exists a long, substantial tail of rewards recipients, suggesting a healthy and well-distributed rewards program. Excluding the two largest claimants, the HHI falls to 334, indicating an extremely competitive environment.</p>\n<p>However, the efficiency of Vertex’s incentive distribution could have been improved if the two largest claimants had not received over half of the rewards. This concentration may have diluted the overall benefits of the program.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1a5e5662a24ea6770fa30fee77ef7094d4010af0.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3LgwWcyiPRg6fflLDnUUioCOVA4.png?dl=1\" title=\"Vertex Share of Arbitrum Gas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a5e5662a24ea6770fa30fee77ef7094d4010af0_2_690x442.png\" alt=\"Vertex Share of Arbitrum Gas\" data-base62-sha1=\"3LgwWcyiPRg6fflLDnUUioCOVA4\" width=\"690\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a5e5662a24ea6770fa30fee77ef7094d4010af0_2_690x442.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a5e5662a24ea6770fa30fee77ef7094d4010af0_2_1035x663.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a5e5662a24ea6770fa30fee77ef7094d4010af0_2_1380x884.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"2E282E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"incentive-risk-analysis-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentive-risk-analysis-22\"></a>Incentive Risk Analysis</h1>\n<p>The incentive risk analysis uses the above deep bottom-up analysis of the Vertex Protocol informing the specific potential manifestations of these risks in a protocol specific context.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex Risk Factors Under Investigation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vertex incentives create excessive speculation:</strong> This could destabilize aspects of the protocol, cause excessive user losses, or potentially affect ecosystem partners.</li>\n<li><strong>Vertex incentives skew the natural growth of trading activity and liquidity:</strong> This could cause risks such as bad debts from liquidation slippage, poor user experience, or markets depegging from their underlying index prices.</li>\n<li><strong>Vertex incentives distort the growth of Arbitrum perpetual trading:</strong> Vertex growth could come at the expense of competing DEXs, rather than onboarding net new activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Vertex incentives do not grow liquidity over the long term:</strong> Liquidity leaves once STIP incentives end.</li>\n<li><strong>Incentives do not lead to sustained trading activity:</strong> Trading activity leaves once STIP incentives end.</li>\n<li><strong>Incentives counteract the wind down of bridged USDC.e on Arbitrum:</strong> Futures collateral on Vertex is USDC.e meaning growth in TVL would increase the demand for USDC.e on Arbitrum.</li>\n<li><strong>Vertex incentives cause protocol infrastructure malfunction:</strong> The increase in activity could cause external elements such as the Vertex Edge liquidity connection, or the Elixir liquidity connection to fail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these risks are individually covered in detail below.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex incentives create excessive speculation</strong></p>\n<p>To evaluate the risk of excessive speculation, we use the volume of weekly liquidations as an indicator.

Vertex simple trading incentives rebating trading fees are unlikely to cause any artificial skew in protocol activity, and therefore this risk is viewed as negligible in this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex incentives distort the growth of Arbitrum perpetual trading</strong></p>\n<p>This risk was addressed previously in the analysis of TVL growth across Arbitrum’s perpetual futures market. There was no significant evidence to suggest that Vertex’s growth materially cannibalized its competitors within the ecosystem; Vertex’s growth during the STIP accounted for only 20% of the overall increase in TVL.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Vertex’s straightforward incentive structure and its role as an alternative to centralized exchanges do not adversely affect the overall development of perpetual trading on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex incentives do not grow liquidity over the long term</strong></p>\n<p>The persistence of TVL in the Vertex Fusion vaults since the ending of the STIP indicates that the incentives were successful in bootstrapping sustained liquidity on Vertex.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentives do not lead to sustained trading activity</strong></p>\n<p>This topic is discussed in more detail above. While it’s true that activity in certain segments has declined since the program ended, new traders continue to join at a steady rate. Furthermore, the retention rate of these traders is improving, and the average trading volumes across most segments remain higher than they were prior to the program.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentives counteract the wind down of bridged USDC.e on Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vertex_protocol/status/1745491926554697934\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">migrated</a> all USDC in its smart contracts from bridged to native USDC on 12 January 2024.  In addition from this date onwards all staking rewards were distributed in native USDC.  This mitigated this risk completely.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex incentives cause protocol infrastructure malfunction</strong></p>\n<p>There were no outages reported over the course of the STIP or after.  Vertex has handled the extra load of incentivized trading without issue.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-takeaways-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-takeaways-23\"></a>Key Takeaways</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"vertex-incentive-positives-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-incentive-positives-24\"></a>Vertex Incentive Positives</h2>\n<p><strong>Using Incentives to Amplify New Protocol Upgrades and Announcements</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex launched its Elixir market making vaults at the same time the program commenced creating additional hype.  Three weeks after launch its native token VRTX launched drawing further attention to the protocol and its incentive program.</p>\n<p>Linking the STIP incentives to bootstrapping the both liquidity in the Elixir vaults, and trading activity played an important role in the sustained yields in these vaults over the long term as activity growth provided a native yield source for the liquidity.</p>\n<p>Together these appear to have played a key role in making the program discoverable, and drawing in users in a competitive space.</p>\n<p><strong>Keeping the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex incentives were extremely easy to understand, and optimize for.  Traders would receive up to 75% of their trading fees back, and LPs would earn 15% APY on their capital.  This told traders exactly what they needed to do to earn rewards, and set clear expectations around the degree of incentivization.</p>\n<p><strong>Focusing on the Demand Side of the Market</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex incentives were heavily weighted towards incentivizing trading activity with 85% of incentives going to trading fee rebates.  This brought fee-paying activity which then transitioned into a sustainable yield source for liquidity providers.</p>\n<p>Getting the balance between supply and demand right is a complex challenge and in hindsight Vertex has managed this extremely well.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigating Wash Trading by Ensuring Users Incur a Small Cost</strong></p>\n<p>Maintaining a positive cost to trade is essential in avoiding wash trading and mercenary rewards farming.  Vertex STIP rewards were intentionally designed to only rebate 75% of taker fees, making it unprofitable to trade solely to farm rewards.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"vertex-incentive-potential-improvements-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-incentive-potential-improvements-25\"></a>Vertex Incentive Potential Improvements</h2>\n<p><strong>Less Concentration Amongst Two Large Accounts</strong></p>\n<p>Healthy trading venues thrive on diverse trading activity, which enables liquidity providers to offset risk and ensures the market functions optimally. However, a high concentration of rewards, with 53% allocated to just two accounts, diminishes the distribution of rewards to other participants, potentially undermining the intended effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Power-Retail Traders Did Not Sustain their Activity</strong></p>\n<p>Power-retail traders which we identify as the 75th percentile highest monthly volume trades, dropped in average monthly volume to their original level.  An allocation of incentives specifically targeted at this segment such as trading competitions could have retained their engagement better.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"vertex-stip-useful-resources-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-stip-useful-resources-26\"></a>Vertex STIP Useful Resources</h1>\n<p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-final-stip-round-1/17435\">STIP Application</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Pv5X_zbn-wXUk8-SFnTxZOJrvg9PNvKRge69CZUbv4/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Slide Presentation</a></p>\n<p><strong>Bi-weekly updates:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-stip-program-update/19608\">Update 1</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-stip-program-update-nov-30-2023/19838\">Update 2</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-bi-weekly-update-december-15-2023/20081\">Update 3</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-bi-weekly-update-december-29-2023/20320\">Update 4</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-jan-12-2024/20600\">Update 5</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-jan-26-2024/20879\">Update 6</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-feb-9-2024/21171\">Update 7</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-feb-23-2024/21431\">Update 8</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-march-8-2024/22335\">Update 9</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-march-22-2024/22813\">Update 10</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"disclaimer-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#disclaimer-27\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>The reports, and other information and materials (“<strong>Materials</strong>”) made available by Chaos Labs, Inc.

Misconduct by Synapse</a></h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum Research &amp; Development Committee (ARDC) has raised concerns about Synapse’s use of ARB incentives from STIP Round 2. After receiving 2M ARB, 750K ARB was transferred to three wallets, which still hold the ARB and have delegated it to a Synapse co-founder. These actions may violate STIP rules requiring unused ARB to be returned to the DAO and prohibiting its use in governance. An explanation from Synapse is requested.</p>\n<p>You can read the full forum post <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/concerns-regarding-possible-misconduct-by-synapse-with-respect-to-the-usage-of-arb-incentives-allocated-through-the-stip/23775\">here.</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"delegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changeshttpsforumarbitrumfoundationtdelegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changes23784-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#delegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changeshttpsforumarbitrumfoundationtdelegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changes23784-9\"></a><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changes/23784\">Delegates Incentive Program Upcoming Changes</a></h3>\n<p>The Delegates Incentive Program has reached its second month, and some areas for improvement have been identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stop Comments on Technical Proposals</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Update Participation Rate</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Lower Token Threshold</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A public call will be held on Friday, May 17th at 12:00 UTC to discuss these changes.

To do this we are both researching how other ecosystems are tackling this(if they are), what social media outlets we currently have as an ecosystem and how can we create a strategy that actually helps Arbitrum DAO!</p>\n<p>My goal as the Gandalf is to enable a collaborative medium in which all the contributors can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>co-work on identifying the current social media needs</li>\n<li>co-design a strategy that we can use to fill in any communications gaps and hopefully increase the reach of the current outlets the Arbitrum ecosystem and the DAO has.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some possible outcomes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a strategy that “makes” sense for the current phase of the DAO. To do this we will gather data and feedback from delegates as well as contributors involved in social media related acitivities in the DAO.</li>\n<li>Expand Arbitrums reach on new “native web3” socials: Lens, Farcaster, Linkedin, etc and on web2 socials: Instagram, Facebook, etc. There are numerous Arbitrum language specific groups on web2 socials that have a LOT of members.</li>\n<li>Allow the DAO and community members to step in and contribute</li>\n<li>Creating a decentralized bounty board in which community members can propose valuable ideas and also work on them.</li>\n<li>Attempt to decentralize the social media group over time and create a “headless” brand for the Arbitrum DAO worldwide.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What would short term success look like:</p>\n<ol start=\"0\">\n<li>Gathering feedback</li>\n<li>Mapping out urgent needs, gaps we have in Arbitrum DAO comms</li>\n<li>Expanding to Farcaster and Lens. We can also leverage the Farcaster frames 500k retro.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What would medium-long term success look like:</p>\n<ol start=\"0\">\n<li>Allow the DAO to submit requests to the group and overtime decentralize the \"management’ or at least “content” creation</li>\n<li>Enable anyone to launch a local chapter for Arbitrum DAO and be able to clearly measure their success by creating a funding round using QF. This way we can enable the best social media managers, content creators to step in. The Arbitrum community will decide who are the best ones and how much they should be funded!</li>\n<li>Exponentially increase the reach of Arbitrum DAOs social media presence, education and digital events</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are scheduled to meet at least 5 times over the course of 2 months to propose formal objectives for the group. At the end of the 2 months, we are expected to draft a proposal or disband the group.

Most relevant to the STEP program, Steakhouse pioneered MakerDAO’s RWA program (which now totals over $2.5bn in asset value) and is responsible for monitoring and tracking the performance and cashflows of those assets.</p>\n<p>Each month, Steakhouse provides a high level monthly report on Maker’s RWA portfolio, the most recent of which can be found <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-asset-report-2024-03/24159\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to this summary report, Steakhouse performs in-depth reporting and analysis on each RWA deal, creating publicly available dashboards with complete cashflows wherever possible. Please reference the below examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HJDfe9hLA0_vTmdtyIqBoaHik68Imp6a-LzMtVDnH0/edit#gid=517022340\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Huntingdon Valley Bank</a> - A partnership with a Pennsylvania community bank to finance commercial and consumer loans, facilitated by a Delaware statutory trust.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/steakhouse/makerdao-clydesdale\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Clydesdale Dune Dashboard</a> - A transaction designated for the purchase of 0-6 month treasury bills, arranged by Monetalis and facilitated by a British Virgin Islands SPV.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Steakhouse creates a monthly economic report for the overall protocol, tracking the balance sheet, income, and other key metrics.

For examples of this covenant monitoring, please see the monthly RWA report for MakerDAO, linked again for convenience <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-asset-report-2024-03/24159\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.

In New Silver’s case, the underlying portfolio is confidential, but summary characteristics are provided in the monthly report to show compliance with the stated covenants.</p>\n<p><em>Operations and Counterparty Monitoring</em></p>\n<p>Steakhouse has performed a series of in-depth reviews of RWA issuers and service providers. Some of these reviews have been performed in conjunction with MakerDAO transactions and some as public goods.</p>\n<p>Please see the below examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-002-new-silver-restructuring-risk-and-legal-assessment/21417\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">New Silver Restructuring Risk and Legal Assessment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JZG6sPetgbKoT-9ETeqb692n7lcXLYUI/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Overview of Blackrock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RP8MU45vx86hZpjdVO6MxVmmDdaHrxhV/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mountain Protocol (USDM) Economic and Legal Review</a></p>\n<p>In each case, Steakhouse performed thorough due-diligence to understand each point in the operational chain of the product and identify key risks and points of failure.

With this framework in mind, Steakhouse would monitor the following essential investment characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Capital Preservation: Minimizing credit risk to safeguard investment principal.</li>\n<li>Legal Risk: Assessing risks related to bankruptcy and regulatory changes to avoid legal entanglements.</li>\n<li>Liquidity and Salability: Ensuring that assets can be readily converted into cash without a significant loss in value.</li>\n<li>Yield and Relative Value: Striving for returns that are competitive with similar risk investments, particularly when benchmarked against U.S. Treasuries.</li>\n<li>Operational Processes: Valuing transparency and resilience in operational practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steakhouse proposes that a material and adverse change in any of these categories—should such changes prove irreparable in a timely manner—constitutes sufficient grounds to recommend the withdrawal or reduction of the investment allocation. Ultimately, many of these factors are subjective and require a deep understanding of traditional markets, institutional processes, and the broader crypto markets. Steakhouse is uniquely equipped to undertake this analysis, backed by our team’s extensive and diverse experience in these areas.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"please-list-any-experience-your-firm-has-in-working-with-decentralized-organizational-structures-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#please-list-any-experience-your-firm-has-in-working-with-decentralized-organizational-structures-21\"></a>Please list any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organizational structures</h4>\n<p>Please see the “past experience\" section above.

Similar to existing institutional processes, Steakhouse typically performs reviews annually, monthly, or more frequently as necessary, to assess changes to the asset characteristics or operational processes of each investment. A typical review cycle would be as follows:</p>\n<p><em>Daily</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor broad market events and changes, as well as disruptions to liquidity or general systemic function</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Monthly</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct a thorough review of underlying portfolio assets to assess market trends, price movements, and changes in credit risks.</li>\n<li>Certify covenant compliance to ensure all investment conditions are met, safeguarding against contractual breaches.</li>\n<li>Assess performance relative to any key benchmarks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Annually (or more frequently as necessary)</em></p>\n<p>Perform standard due diligence on each issuer through detailed questionnaires and direct calls to assess key changes, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ownership and organizational structure changes</li>\n<li>Shifts in executive or senior management</li>\n<li>Updates in accounting, technology, and custodial or other service providers</li>\n<li>Status of permits and licensing</li>\n<li>Material litigation or legal proceedings</li>\n<li>Any regulatory enforcement actions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These comprehensive checks and reviews are designed to capture a holistic view of each asset, ensuring all potential risks are managed proactively.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"describe-the-content-format-and-preparation-process-of-performance-reports-this-should-include-details-of-interest-earned-and-status-of-total-assets-provide-a-sample-if-available-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#describe-the-content-format-and-preparation-process-of-performance-reports-this-should-include-details-of-interest-earned-and-status-of-total-assets-provide-a-sample-if-available-24\"></a>Describe the content, format and preparation process of performance reports.
