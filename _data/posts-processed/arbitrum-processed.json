All milestones are reached, and Gains Network is planning to distribute the final 10,000 $ARB to their multi-sig this week.</li>\n<li><strong>DexPal</strong>: After multiple conversations with the DexPal team, it has become clear their protocol won’t be live for the public before the STIP.B program ends as some PerpDEX integrations aren’t finalized yet. Therefore, they won’t be able to host a gTrade-specific trading competition, and the GCGP Committee has voted to hold on to the 10,000 ARB that was budgeted for this campaign (and will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO before the cutoff date). However, as shown in t<a href=\"https://gov.gains.trade/t/dexpal-gcgp-bridge-grant-bi-weekly-report-week-6/93\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">heir latest bi-weekly report</a>, the gTrade integration is finished and therefore Gains Network will distribute the 5,000 $ARB that’s budgeted for this milestone.</li>\n<li><strong>Exodus:</strong> The Exodus x gTrade trading competition has has concluded on September 9th 23:59 UTC and Gains Network will distribute 20,000 $ARB among the winners this week.

It has yet to be seen if they are able to run the trading competition before the cutoff date of September 23rd. Gains Network is monitoring the situation and final disbursement will depend on feasibility of said competition.</li>\n<li><strong>Mimik Finance:</strong> <em>Same as last update:</em> The project was excluded from the GCGP due to a lack of communication and failure to update on any progress. After conversations regarding the lowered grant size following their 6th placement in Snapshot votes, the GCGP Committee attempted to confirm their funding address multiple times.

Alongside this update - as well as upon the confirmation by the Arbitrum STIP.B program manager to extend the programs deadlines (September 23rd) - the team decided to extend trading incentives with 1 Epoch, until September 19th by halving the ARB per amount per week for the final 2 Epochs. And, dedicate all trading incentives to altcoin-native volume. See this thread for more details on the effort: <a href=\"https://x.com/GainsNetwork_io/status/1831855734906130600\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">x.com</a></p>\n<p>For reference on the extension of deadlines (initial cutoff date at September 16th, now set at September 23rd) — allowing Gains Network to extend with trading incentives with 1 Epoch until September 19th:<br>\n<img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/09469deea157df17061f3f81a0ad0ec7d481080d.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"1k3AMCfnFaauPwpKhwyG0sIYKcd\" width=\"594\" height=\"164\"></p>\n<p>LP incentives had been mostly budgeted for before the above-mentioned grace period.

This working group aims to deliver a proposal for the DAO for a vote in December after the detox period. The working group will proceed in three phases: discovery, framework design, and Approval. The discovery phase includes delegate/protocol interviews, analyzing past incentive performance and limitations, and researching other ecosystem / traditional government incentive designs. This research will be used to create guidelines for incentives and design a framework for utilization. Finally, the group will take this framework to make a final proposal, including demonstrable KPIs, for a broader DAO vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58421-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The DAO has consistently expressed interest in using incentives to attract users and protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, to date, we have not yet taken sufficient time to design from first principles, that is, to first understand the goals and objectives of the program, deploying incentives to achieve particular measures. Arbitrum has also not had a chance to thoroughly analyze past incentives’ performance nor design a robust framework that may last more than a few months. We believe funding a small working group would create a better incentive program. Through a focused effort, we will help the DAO produce a sustainable incentives framework to satisfy both delegates and protocols.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58421-how-previous-incentives-have-been-designed-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-how-previous-incentives-have-been-designed-4\"></a>How previous Incentives have been designed:</h3>\n<p>Prior Incentive Program Design</p>\n<p>STIP. STIP was created quickly using a DAO-wide working group funded by a foundation grant in response to the DAO voting down <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x6b001068a3aa7f58e0e334a1f717be2145eb4c7b3f3af479cd827020aa2993a6\">Camelot’s incentive proposal</a> and requesting a larger framework for granting protocol incentives. It was the first major DAO initiative and achieved the goal of creating a first attempt at incentives. While it was not a perfect program, it got the ball rolling and taught us about incentives.</p>\n<p>LTIPP. The creation of the LTIPP proposal was funded retroactively once it was passed. This proposal involved risk on behalf of the composing parties. It took four months of writing, lobbying delegates, and modifying the proposal to ensure ratification. The improvements of LTIPP focused on making operational changes to STIP challenges while providing incentives to protocols not funded in STIP. These changes allowed Arbitrum to broaden its incentive distribution while evaluating a new program structure that included the council and advisors.</p>\n<p>STIP.B. The creation of STIP.B was not funded. STIP.B was a grassroots effort by protocols that argued that incentives should continue for protocols that used STIP rewards correctly to keep the largest Arbitrum protocols focused on Arbitrum while other chains offered large grants to migrate.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58421-prior-program-design-flaws-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-prior-program-design-flaws-5\"></a>Prior Program Design Flaws</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"p-58421-insufficient-planning-period-too-rushed-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-insufficient-planning-period-too-rushed-6\"></a>Insufficient Planning Period (Too Rushed)</h4>\n<p>The previous incentive programs were designed under tight time pressure. With STIP, the DAO was rushing to get something started. With LTIPP, the DAO wanted to ensure we had a program to immediately follow STIP. With STIP.B, the STIP protocols tried to ensure they could follow a similar timeline to stay competitive with LTIPP.</p>\n<p>Without sufficient time, the DAO could not decide the concrete objectives of these programs. This has made it extremely hard to evaluate the success of the programs. Additionally, with a near-zero gap between programs, there was insufficient time to examine past performance and improve distribution efficiency. While LTIPP introduced the council and advisors to help protocols create better incentive plans, we need more data-driven guidelines on how protocols should utilize incentives to maximize return on ARB grants. Finally, because these programs were each planned independently, they have all been short 3-5 months as we have not had time to create a robust global framework to last 1+ years. This disconnection between programs has made protocols unsure of when their next chance at funding will be, making it much harder for them to plan their future in Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>At present, we have a three-month break from incentives. This window presents an opportunity to research and create a thoughtful Arbitrium Incentives program. To best take advantage of this time, it makes sense to have a group of stakeholders focused on and responsible for completing the necessary research. With the research in hand, this group may then deliver a framework and program design to meet the needs of all DAO stakeholders.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-58421-no-one-was-incentivized-to-create-a-long-lasting-and-sustainable-framework-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-no-one-was-incentivized-to-create-a-long-lasting-and-sustainable-framework-7\"></a>No One Was Incentivized to Create a Long-Lasting and Sustainable Framework</h4>\n<p>Presently, there is no compensation or incentives for the research, coordination, and planning of Arbitrum incentive programs. This is a nontrivial amount of work and requires both incentive research and operations research, ultimately translating these into effective program design. Without a clear commitment from Arbitrum, counterparties bear significant risks in performing this research. As a result, programs were underdesigned and underresearched.</p>\n<p>In the absence of the necessary incentives, past program design opted for an open incentives working group. This format led to a diffusion of responsibility and inefficiency. The proposal creation phase was focused on passing a DAO vote quickly instead of optimizing for the best possible program.</p>\n<p>A smaller group of responsible individuals will likely lead to better-focused outcomes. When a group is accountable to the DAO, we can expect better results as incentives are aligned with performance.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-58421-no-clear-objective-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-no-clear-objective-8\"></a>No clear objective</h4>\n<p>While everybody tends to agree, at a high level, that incentive programs should foster “growth” and “adoption,” we fall short of properly specifying the KPIs and the base ground values achieved before and after it. The byproduct is the inability to measure the effective success or failure. The lack of discussion on this topic will make every program meaningless.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58421-specifications-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-specifications-9\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58421-working-group-roles-responsibilities-and-deliverables-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-working-group-roles-responsibilities-and-deliverables-10\"></a>Working Group Roles, Responsibilities, and Deliverables</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"p-58421-qualitative-stakeholder-interviews-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-qualitative-stakeholder-interviews-11\"></a>Qualitative Stakeholder Interviews</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Interview delegates to understand what they would want to see from an incentive program</li>\n<li>Interview protocols to understand what they would want to see from an incentive program</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-58421-web3-and-traditional-market-research-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-web3-and-traditional-market-research-12\"></a>Web3 and Traditional Market Research</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Study the landscape of incentive programs in crypto in other ecosystems to avoid pitfalls and better understand benefits.</li>\n<li>Examine what categories and/or objectives a future incentives framework should include.

To achieve the best results, Arbtirum should assign a modest budget to ensure satisfactory delivery. Funding this working group will give the DAO more information in three months to make a smarter decision when voting on the next incentives program.</p>\n<p>Considering the scale of the programs, potentially 50,000,000+ ARB, an operational expenditure of approximately 0.4% is acceptable and reasonable examining market comparables. In general, fund operations cost around 2% per annum, exclusive of planning and setup costs. Our hopes are to vastly improve the performance of ARB incentive programs, leading to long term cost savings and efficiency gains.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58421-team-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-team-17\"></a>Team</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Matt StableLab: PM for STIP/LTIPP/STIP.B, Proposal Author LTIPP, MSS signer, Arbitrum delegate.</li>\n<li>JoJo: LTIPP/STIP.b Advisor, Grant committee of Questbook and UAGP, delegate in Arbitrum, MSS signer, product and risk analyst at Jones.</li>\n<li>Castle Capital: Research and Advisory Collective with experience as an LTIPP/STIP.b Advisor, a Media Publisher, a Protocol Consultancy, an MSS Member, and a delegate in the DAO</li>\n<li>404DAO: Arbitrum Delegate who served as a LTIPP Council member, MSS Member and Onboarding WG</li>\n<li>GMX: LTIPP Council Member, Active Arbitrum Delegate, One of the oldest and largest Arbitrum Protocols.</li>\n<li>Blockworks Research: ARDC Research Member, Active Arbitrum Delegate, published numerous reports on STIP</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58421-process-overview-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-process-overview-18\"></a>Process Overview</h2>\n<p>Only three steps are required to operationalize this proposal.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pass a Snapshot Vote to approve the Working Group budget.</li>\n<li>Working group members complete Foundation onboarding, including compliance and execution of required agreements.</li>\n<li>The LTIPP multisig transfers funds to each respective working group member.

These events can include, but are not limited to:\n<ul>\n<li>Virtual hackathons</li>\n<li>Non-crypto conference presence (RustConf, CES, etc.)</li>\n<li>In-person hackathons</li>\n<li>Side events</li>\n<li>Sponsorships of major events</li>\n<li>Arbitrum Days around the world (not just EthCC)</li>\n<li>Educational workshops (Stylus &amp; Orbit)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC and Disruption Joe, we will gauge community sentiment/attendance levels regarding certain events. If there is consensus to put on a certain event but there is no PM/event coordinator to lead the effort, the group will procure, select, and support service providers to make the vision a reality. Alternatively, if an events provider comes to the DAO with a proposal for an event that passes a snapshot vote with at least 100M votes in favor/abstain, the funds for that proposal will come from the 2025 events budget brought forth in this proposal.</p>\n<p>We propose the earmarking of <strong>$1.5M USD</strong> to fund this initiative, with any unused funds at the end of 2025 to be returned to the DAO treasury. <strong>4M ARB</strong> will be sent to a Foundation-controlled address to be liquidated into stablecoins, with any excess ARB immediately returned to the DAO treasury and the stablecoins to an MSS-controlled address. The ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe will be waiving payment to get this stood up, but we expect this initiative to fall under the OpCo once it becomes fully operational. We also envision a dedicated employee to lead the DAO’s event strategy within the OpCo, so this is more of an effort to get the ball rolling so we are properly prepared for 2025. We plan to have the OpCo established in early-to-mid 2025, and once an events coordinator is employed by this entity, the funds will be transferred to the OpCo while Entropy, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe will be relieved of their duties thereafter. Note that if the ADPC is not <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x66812a5c91fe5f590965148c76f1ca609fdc5ded722544673c275a3b2ed94549\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">re-elected</a>, this proposal may be updated to include pay for the ADPC. We will clearly articulate that change if it is required prior to moving on to a Snapshot vote.</p>\n<p>Also note that we are aware of an active <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-offsite-format-online-vs-irl/26629\">proposal</a> to fund a DAO offsite. There is also another proposal to fund <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-core-series-hack-humanity/26634\">GovHack Core</a> for the next year. If this proposal were to pass, and the two aforementioned proposals received 100M Yes/Abstain votes on Snapshot, the funds could come from this proposal’s budget rather than forcing service providers to navigate the onchain voting process (Tally). By earmarking funds through this framework, the DAO can remove the ~4-week Tally/ARB liquidation process thus enabling the DAO to move more nimbly and source a wider variety of potential service providers.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Events play a crucial role in strengthening the Arbitrum community and brand, attracting more users and developers to the ecosystem, expediting DAO initiatives by facilitating in-person collaboration, and providing avenues for alliance with other partners within the industry. While the Questbook program has done an excellent job in ensuring the Arbitrum brand is represented at smaller conferences across multiple regions, the DAO does not currently have a dedicated plan or budget for events. Larger Arbitrum events, such as Arbitrum Day, are left to the Arbitrum Foundation or Offchain Labs to organize. The DAO certainly appreciates what the Foundation and OCL do on the events front, but the DAO should serve a complementary role – which if enabled – will maximize Arbitrum’s overall ability to grow a healthy ecosystem and capture network effects in our speed and flexibility for deployment.</p>\n<p>There is significant value in aligning on the scope/timing of hackathons, GovHack-type events, and major events presence (such as EthCC, DevCon, etc). For example, a Stylus represents one of the most significant software upgrades in Arbitrum’s history – it could be wise for the DAO to ensure a Stylus-focused hackathon is planned for 2025 in an effort to bring more developers into our ecosystem and to improve dev tooling/infra. In addition to ecosystem events, it is very important for delegates to meet up in person at a regular cadence. We see how much more we can accomplish in-person time and time again, and we believe the DAO could formulate and execute on a grander strategy if these delegate offsites were formally planned/coordinated.</p>\n<p>Hosting events requires substantial upfront time and capital, typically involving 4-6 months of planning and $25-100k in down payments for venues, travel, accommodations, catering, and other expenses. Planning and funding events on a case-by-case basis are impractical due to the lead time and the lengthy DAO voting process. Recently, the DAO <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22498645709460639498013508413205734891453964526622655693207250687057651118730\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">approved</a> $309k to host an event at EthTH CC in Brussels. However, the proposal was not executed on-chain until approximately five weeks before the event. Hack Humanity, the entity behind the GovHack event, took on substantial risk by using its funds to secure a venue, caterers, and other necessities without a guarantee of DAO funding. Although Hack Humanity felt comfortable taking this risk due to previous collaboration with the DAO and assistance from Entropy Advisors, this upfront financial burden should not fall on service providers in the future. One off RFP processes would enable organizers to plan higher-quality events with the extra time &amp; budget provided. Alternatively, any service provider can gauge DAO sentiment directly via snapshot, which will drastically reduce the burden of the Arbitrum DAO governance process put on service providers.</p>\n<p>To ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the ability to represent itself at various events and to create new in-person experiences, we propose earmarking funds so this can be achieved in a streamlined manner. While we propose 4 core events in the section below, any DAO member can make a proposal to utilize these earmarked funds at any time. We are also happy to alter the below calendar in accordance with feedback received on the forum.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-proposed-events-calendar-for-2025-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-proposed-events-calendar-for-2025-3\"></a>Proposed Events Calendar for 2025</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/065d193859ec030a848c27fcea83e4db75a97aae.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/UikiO6VfeR3ZgpLROmeYi87zNY.png?dl=1\" title=\"Arbitrum DAO Events V3 (1)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/065d193859ec030a848c27fcea83e4db75a97aae_2_690x318.png\" alt=\"Arbitrum DAO Events V3 (1)\" data-base62-sha1=\"UikiO6VfeR3ZgpLROmeYi87zNY\" width=\"690\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/065d193859ec030a848c27fcea83e4db75a97aae_2_690x318.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/065d193859ec030a848c27fcea83e4db75a97aae_2_1035x477.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/065d193859ec030a848c27fcea83e4db75a97aae_2_1380x636.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B6BCBF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The above events were chosen based on the need to bolster Arbitrum’s presence at the industry’s top events. As mentioned above, the Questbook program has done an excellent job at making sure Arbitrum has a presence at smaller events across the globe. To date the events track has funded event initiatives in the following regions: Latam (8), Africa (6), India (4), APAC (4), and Europe (2).</p>\n<p>There are also ample opportunities to fund events in the back half of 2025 that align with Arbitrum’s strategic objectives (Ex. RustConf, GamesCon, Solana Breakpoint). However, with the expectation that a more comprehensive events strategy will be rolled up into OpCo upon the hiring of a full time events coordinator, we felt it was better suited to only establish a rough strategy for the first half of 2025 while leaving the door open for other service providers and community members to bring forth their own ideas.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58356-eth-denver-february-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-eth-denver-february-4\"></a>ETH Denver - February</h3>\n<p>ETH Denver is an Ethereum centric conference that has one of the largest attendee lists of any event throughout 2025. Arbitrum has historically had a presence here, but we would like to partner with OCL to bolster the DAO’s representation. We envision a very large floor space at ETH Denver (see photo below of Near’s booth at ETH Denver in 2024 for inspiration), with plenty of room for Arbitrum projects to showcase their products, delegates and other DAO contributors to talk to people who are interested in getting involved, and an area for more technical folks to ask OCL questions about the Arbitrum roadmap and tech upgrades. Last year, Arbitrum had a smaller 10x20 or 20x20 floor space at ETH Denver, but this year we want to go bigger. OCL will lead the charge on this front, but the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy can assist as needed and funnel ideas from the community to their team.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/11b5cb68df2614f42437162176baa40b075f70d1.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-22 at 1.15.50 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"2wFBP5E7CWDEYFuju39LSp7oRLb\" width=\"690\" height=\"451\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58356-delegate-offsite-token-2049-april-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-delegate-offsite-token-2049-april-5\"></a>Delegate Offsite (@ Token 2049) - April</h3>\n<p>We believe that in-person networking and collaboration for top delegates is crucial to DAO productivity. As such, we are proposing a delegate offsite at Token2049 in Dubai for 2 days. Exact details have yet to be ironed out, but the primary goal of this event is to accelerate initiatives and to achieve alignment between various ecosystem contributors. The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy will work together to procure a venue, caterer, accommodations for attendees, etc., contingent upon significant attendance/availability from delegates and a successful snapshot vote with a defined budget.</p>\n<p>A sentiment check proposal for a DAO offsite passed on <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x21a4ec3fd338fa4eb2230d0e6131d1411639d94cf1b27864c9a3c1c722568c08\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a> on August 22, but no budget had been defined. The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy will bring forth a new offsite Snapshot with a budget included, and if passed, will begin procuring service providers to fulfill the event.</p>\n<p>Also note that Entropy Advisors plans to continue hosting smaller events for delegates as a part of our previously approved budget. These events are dinners or working spaces that are more casual in nature and do not require additional DAO funding. We believe that these are sufficient and nullify the need for a more formal delegate event funded by the DAO, but as mentioned, we will gauge community sentiment accordingly given the previously passed Snapshot.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58356-bitcoin-2025-may-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-bitcoin-2025-may-6\"></a>Bitcoin 2025 - May</h3>\n<p>The Bitcoin conference is the most widely attended conference in all of crypto, and is ofcourse a Bitcoin-focused event. However, as seen with the rise of “BTC L2s”, Ordinals/Runes/other inscriptions, etc, there is a growing appetite from developers, users, and VCs to build out more functionality on Bitcoin. Additionally, there is work being done to enable OP_CAT, which could enable trust minimized bridging of BTC to other chains. As such, we believe the Arbitrum DAO should have a presence here. There is no reason Orbit should not have a presence on Bitcoin, and the DAO recently signaled its support for Orbit deployments on alternative settlement layers via <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd6138aaca39742a1a56f3219a74a4258e0786aa5494cdfbe752f23277c1b947f\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">snapshot</a> vote. Bitcoin has served as the “Gateway” for bringing new people onchain in the past, and we believe targeting Bitcoin supporters is a good way to onboard new users into the Arbitrum ecosystem. We would like to work with OCL on this event, similar to the ETH Denver event, but the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy can procure a service provider and act as the point of contact in case OCL does not have interest in partnering with the DAO on this event.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58356-eth-cc-july-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-eth-cc-july-7\"></a>ETH CC - July</h3>\n<p>ETH CC, similar to ETH Denver, is one of the largest Ethereum-centric events of the year, and has historically been hosted in the EU. The event in 2025 is currently slated to take place in Cannes, France, but with the recent arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in France, this could potentially change. Nevertheless, this is an event that we believe the Arbitrum DAO should have a presence at, and we again suggest supporting OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to put this event together. In the scenario that OCL/the Foundation does not want to work with the DAO on this initiative, the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy will procure a 3rd party organizer to manage this event and will be in attendance to ensure things go smoothly. We are hopeful that OpCo will be stood up by this time, so there is a strong possibility that this event will fall under its purview rather than the aforementioned individuals/entities.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58356-other-events-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-other-events-8\"></a>Other Events:</h3>\n<p>We estimate the four events outlined above to cost somewhere in the range of $450-$600k, and would thus have a budget approved that is much higher than the actual outlays. We want to avoid scenarios where we are forced to overpay for event service providers, have a limited selection of service providers, or need to rush through the DAO process in order to meet deadlines for future events. Therefore, we are requesting a budget much larger than required so that if other community members wish to push forward an event, they can do so without having to go through the full governance process. Instead, we suggest that anyone can put forth an idea for an event in the first half of 2025, but that it can pull from these pre-approved funds via a snapshot vote that must garner 100M votes in favor/abstain. From there, the ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe can help procure service providers to put on the event, or the proposer themselves can serve as the project manager/event coordinator. This will cut down on the lead time to put on other events and give the DAO more negotiation power when organizing events on an expedited timeline. Some other events that we had envisioned include presence at non-crypto conferences such as RustConf or CES to attract new developers and users, virtual hackathons specifically focused on Stylus or Orbit with the help of a service provider like <a href=\"https://buidlbox.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Buidlbox</a>, <a href=\"https://ethglobal.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ETHGlobal</a>, etc. It is also important to note, that events with an expected cost under $50,000 should be routed through the Questbook program. The purpose of this proposal is to establish an events strategy for larger initiatives that require substantial funds and active project managers.</p>\n<p>We want to emphasize the fact that excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025. We felt some of the other events required a full-time project manager to ensure they go smoothly, and we do not want to take on more than we can handle. However, by requesting more budget than we require, anyone in the community can take lead on an event if there is DAO support.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-specifications-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-specifications-9\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>In order to eliminate the potential for event overload, we are capping the number of delegate gatherings to two for the year - but are leaving the number of ecosystem growth events open-ended. These events should be planned in such a way that no two events align too closely with one another on dates, with the exception of delegate offsites which could coincide with an ecosystem growth event at a major crypto conference given the convenience of planning travel arrangements. The 3M ARB should provide an ample budget regardless of ARB price action. While the primary goal of delegate offsites should be aligning ecosystem leaders and providing a dedicated place/time for more efficient in-person working hours, the ecosystem growth category is more vague in nature. However, all applicants should have clearly articulated goals for the events in line with the defined events strategy, i.e., driving the adoption of Stylus through a hackathon, generating thought-provoking governance proposals, onboarding new people into the DAO similar to GovHack, etc.</p>\n<p>For concrete examples of how this could work, we can take a look at the 2 proposals for events currently on the forum. The GovHack Core proposal has been brought forth by Hack Humanity, which serves as a great example of a scenario where the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy would not be needed in the process at all. Hack Humanity can take their proposal to Snapshot, and because they are the service provider themselves, there is no need for any type of procurement process. If the GovHack Core proposal passes snapshot with 100M votes in favor/abstain, the funds would be sent from the 2025 events budget (this proposal) and Hack Humanity could begin their planning. This would eliminate the ~4-week onchain voting process and potentially make it possible to put something together for DevCon in Bangkok in just ~2 months. This is a prime example of how earmarking an events budget will enable the DAO to move more nimbly. Please note that this proposal is only for 2025, so the previous example is only provided for illustrative purposes. However, it is quite possible that the DAO would rather fund GovHacks on an as-needed/case-by-case basis rather than a whole year, or even open up the event type to other service providers to get new actors involved or potentially lower the price.</p>\n<p>In the example of the proposal from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo\">@danielo</a>, there is no defined offsite facilitator. This is an example of a proposal that does not specify the service provider, so the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy could work together in procuring the proper coordinator if the proposal passes on Snapshot with 100M votes in favor/abstain. The procurement process should bring down overall costs by making the process competitive amongst service providers, and again reduces the lead time by foregoing the onchain Tally vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-flow-of-funds-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-flow-of-funds-10\"></a>Flow of Funds</h2>\n<p>To cover the $1.5M dollar-denominated expenses, 4M ARB would be earmarked and sent to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled wallet, with funds liquidated into a preferred stablecoin sent to the MSS and surplus ARB sent back to the DAO Treasury following the liquidation. Entropy Advisors, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC will be the point of contact for the MSS chair to greenlight any queued transactions. No transactions will be signed without confirmations from all 3 entities/individuals. The MSS may send stablecoins back to the Arbitrum Foundation in order to pay service providers with fiat if required.</p>\n<p>Updates related to funds spent, upcoming events and relevant details, a place to provide feedback or recommendations, or any other communications will be posted to the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/procurement-committee/27\">ADPC update thread</a> on the Arbitrum Forum. Alternatively, Entropy can post these to our <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/entropy-advisors-updates/50\">updates thread</a> on the Arbitrum Forum.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-steps-to-implement-and-timeline-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-steps-to-implement-and-timeline-11\"></a>Steps to Implement and Timeline</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>“Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025” Forum post (1-4 weeks)</li>\n<li>“Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025” Snapshot post (1 week)</li>\n<li>“Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025” Tally vote (~3 weeks)</li>\n<li>The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy Advisors can begin working with OCL and other SPs to ensure the events calendar brought forth comes to fruition.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We expect this process to take about 2-3 months in its entirety to get underway, which will provide the DAO ample time to prepare for its 2025 events.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-overall-ask-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-overall-ask-12\"></a>Overall Ask</h2>\n<p>The upfront ask to the DAO is $1.5M and the transfer of 4M ARB with the excess returned to the DAO post liquidation, but with just 1 delegate gathering and the 3 ecosystem growth events outlined in this proposal, the entire budget will not be utilized. However, as mentioned earlier, earmarking these funds gives the DAO the ability to act more nimbly when there is an opportunity to host an event. This will result in the DAO getting better pricing from potential service providers while ensuring the service provider has ample time to do what they do best - organize great events. The DAO can clawback funds from the MSS at any time via a snapshot vote that garners 100M votes in favor/abstain.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734","pubDate":"Tue, 10 Sep 2024 18:32:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26734"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734.rss","#text":"Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025"},"filter":false},{"title":"Balancer DAO Bi-Weekly Update September 9th 2024","dc:creator":"zen_dragon","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/da9b597efa6976854c9d0bd099491ad88199951e.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vbSVg2tsQ9WjzAC4NczoDT9BYwC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Balancer -

Furthermore Galaxe has teamed up with Balancer to give new and recurring participants an opportunity to get to know our ecosystem and experience the tech that Balancer has to offer.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sjx8CuUfwDGWnjdhUQfrG4sDATs.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Balancer x Galaxe Arbitrum Quests\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"Balancer x Galaxe Arbitrum Quests\" data-base62-sha1=\"sjx8CuUfwDGWnjdhUQfrG4sDATs\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"34383A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Check out the quest board <a href=\"https://app.galxe.com/quest/Balancer/GCskLtvDZi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The pool for <a href=\"https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x8d58755ca11d2c7273fed72aeb637e38a66c228c00000000000000000000058c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sUSX </a>came in hot with 700k TVL and now reachd 1.3MM in TVL.

It is common for these initiatives to have a multi-signature wallet (multi-sig) committee responsible for managing and dispersing DAO-approved funds, following the terms agreed by the DAO via on-chain governance, as well as with the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836\">DAO recently approved the Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)</a>, so there will likely be greater standardization and streamlined multi-sig operations going forward. Accordingly, the Arbitrum Foundation would like to share some ‘Multi-Sig Best Practices’ based on its observations of the existing DAO-related multi-sigs. It is recommended that DAO-related multi-sigs, including the MSS, follow the guidelines and processes outlined below to adhere to high operational security (OpSec) standards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-signer-best-practices-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-signer-best-practices-1\"></a>Signer Best Practices</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use Secure Hardware:</strong> Maintain at least two hardware wallets with the same seed phrase. These hardware wallets should be exclusively dedicated to DAO-related multi-sig transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Dedicated Devices:</strong> Utilize a separate, dedicated laptop or device solely for signing transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Unique Signer Addresses (Keys):</strong> Use a unique signer address (key) for each DAO-related multi-sig wallet. Avoid reusing addresses (keys) across different DAO-related multi-sig wallets. Each unique signer address (key) can be generated from the same wallet (i.e. using the same seed phrase). All signer addresses must be shared with the Arbitrum Foundation to pass compliance.</li>\n<li><strong>Unique Payment Address:</strong> If you receive compensation for performing multi-sig signer duties, use a separate address from your signer address(es) to receive payments. All payment addresses must be shared with the Arbitrum Foundation to pass compliance.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction Simulation:</strong> Always simulate transactions using Tenderly (available on Safe) to ensure the transaction performs as intended before signing.</li>\n<li><strong>Verify Information:</strong> Double-check all relevant sources of truth, such as the on-chain Tally proposal, before signing any transaction. If in doubt, do reach out to the DAO Relations team at the Arbitrum Foundation (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/raam\">@raam</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cliffton.eth\">@cliffton.eth</a>), and to fellow signers, to ensure that all details about the queued payment(s) are accurate as per the on-chain Tally proposal and agreement terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise Caution and Seek Assistance:</strong> If you are unsure about a transaction, do not sign. Raise any concerns with fellow signers immediately. If you encounter any technical issues, promptly ask for help.</li>\n<li><strong>Bookmark Essential Links:</strong> Bookmark links to DAO-related multi-sig wallets or rely on pre-established, trusted sources. Avoid clicking on links provided by external parties.</li>\n<li><strong>Availability Notification:</strong> Inform fellow signers at least 24 hours in advance if you expect to be unavailable or unable to sign transactions for any period.</li>\n<li><strong>Report Key Issues:</strong> Notify other signers and the Arbitrum Foundation via email immediately if you lose access to your signing keys or suspect they have been compromised.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-setting-up-a-multi-sig-wallet-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-setting-up-a-multi-sig-wallet-2\"></a>Setting Up a Multi-Sig Wallet</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initial Communication:</strong> All signers should exchange email communications and share a signed message from the key to be installed. The message should include:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum account address: “[signer address]\"</li>\n<li>A statement identifying the signer and the multi-sig wallet they are joining: “[Message: I am X and I am joining the Y multi-sig]\"</li>\n<li>Signature hash: ”[signature]\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Key Authentication:</strong> Conduct 1-to-1 and group calls among signers to authenticate the signing key with the owner. Do not rely solely on Telegram for key authentication.</li>\n<li><strong>Clawback of Funds:</strong> As the ultimate owner of its funds, the ArbitrumDAO should be able to clawback funds from any of its multi-sigs by executing a respective Tally proposal - which can be enabled if multi-sigs are set up using the Zodiac Governor Module, for example.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-adhering-to-terms-and-conditions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-adhering-to-terms-and-conditions-3\"></a>Adhering to Terms and Conditions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Review Proposals Carefully:</strong> Always review the respective on-chain Tally proposal before disbursing any funds, as they are the source of truth for payment schedules, payment caps, recipients, and other important details. If you have doubts, please reach out to the DAO Relations team at the Arbitrum Foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>Follow Agreements:</strong> Abide by the terms and conditions of any agreements made with the Arbitrum Foundation.

However, the tally vote earmarked 100k ARB as payment to program manager for one year (which converted to $86,581) while Steakhouse quoted a fee of $174,000 in their application. This proposal seeks input on the right way forward, with the options to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approve only a 6 month contract from available funds</li>\n<li>Earmark additional funds so they complete their one year tenure</li>\n<li>Not have a program manager, which will result in liquidation of the RWAs and</li>\n<li>Conduct a new RFP to select a  program manager for one year at $86,581</li>\n<li>Abstain</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong> - On April 10th 2024, the DAO <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">approved</a> 35 million ARB for diversification into RWAs. Of this, 100,000 ARB was budgeted for the role of program manager. The Arbitrum Foundation got an average price of 87 cents per ARB, resulting in $86,581 to pay the program manager.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/af2547aad4c9a618e8dddf678b3f2d9997026125.jpeg\" alt=\"conversino\" data-base62-sha1=\"oZpqC3ftcOtE8cPnHpfpFBsaPnT\" width=\"594\" height=\"188\"></p>\n<p>In their <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/steakhouse-financial-step-program-manager/23829\">application</a>, Steakhouse quoted $174,000 per year. Given the funds received from the 100,000 ARB sale ($86,531) are less than the amount necessary to pay for a full year of the Program Manager’s services, we need to either shorten their term to 6 months or approve an additional 6 months pay (from yield earned via the program). We can also declare the earlier election null and void while putting out a call for program managers willing to serve at $86,581 for a year. If there is no program manager to oversee investments, assets are liquidated and returned to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> - While writing the Tally proposal, I budgeted 100k ARB for the program manager role based on a quotation received from another provider and the prevailing ARB price at the time.</p>\n<p>Steakhouse financial and the other applicants prepared a budget in dollar value, not ARB. As a result, i under-budgeted the program manager role in the STEP program and now need approval from the DAO on provisioning either a shortened tenure of 6 months or additional funding to complete the one year. The additional funds will be requested from the yield earned on the RWAs (estimated at between $1-2 million per year) to prevent ARB liquidations. Alternatively, we can hold a new RFP seeking program managers at a fixed price of $86,581 for the year and invalidate the earlier election.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong> - The STEP program is one of the largest diversification initiatives at any DAO, seeking to diversify our treasury while simultaneously growing the RWA ecosystem. Given the complications that can arise in managing the large sums of money, it is imperative that the DAO have a capable program manager to recommend liquidations,conduct firedrills, monitor interest payments to the DAO treasury, and track underlying changes in service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong> -  After ratification of their role as STEP program manager and whether it is 6 months or 1 year, the Arbitrum foundation will sign an agreement with Steakhouse Financial and begin investments into selected RWA providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong> -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Post on forum</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upload on Snapshot (Thursday, 12th September)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Foundation negotiates agreement with Steakhouse and pays the first 6 months of their payment from the initial 100,000 ARB budgeted for in the STEP proposal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After RWA yield is returned to the treasury, this proposal is taken to Tally requesting balance of $87,419  (provided one year tenure is approved in the snapshot)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong> - If the entire one year tenure is ratified, the cost to the DAO is $87,419. If 6 month tenure is approved, the cost is needing another election for program manager in a shortened time. If the proposal is rejected, we liquidate all $30 million and return assets to the DAO. If a new RFP is held seeking program manager services for $86,581 for a year, we delay the start of the STEP program and possibly get a less capable pool of applicants at the lower price point.</p>\n<p>Work done in shepherding this proposal is paid for through a Thrivecoin firestarter grant to the Arbitrum treasury and sustainability group.</p>\n            <p><small>11 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-terms-of-tenure-for-step-program-manager/26675\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-terms-of-tenure-for-step-program-manager/26675","pubDate":"Sat, 07 Sep 2024 07:59:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26675"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-terms-of-tenure-for-step-program-manager/26675.rss","#text":"**Non-Constitutional: Terms of Tenure for STEP Program Manager**"},"filter":false},{"title":"Stylus SDK Audit","dc:creator":"openzeppelin","category":"General","description":"<p>At the request of the Arbitrum Foundation, OpenZeppelin audited Offchain Lab’s Stylus SDK.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Type:   Smart Contract Language</p>\n<p>Timeline:   From 2024-07-08 To 2024-08-09</p>\n<p>Languages:   Rust</p>\n<p>Total Issues:   36 (27 resolved, 1 partially resolved)</p>\n<p>Critical Severity Issues:   2 (1 resolved, 1 partially resolved)</p>\n<p>High Severity Issues:   2 (2 resolved)</p>\n<p>Medium Severity Issues:   10 (7 resolved)</p>\n<p>Low Severity Issues:   12 (8 resolved)</p>\n<p>Notes &amp; Additional Information:   10 (9 resolved)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-scope-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-scope-2\"></a>Scope</h2>\n<p>We audited the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs</a> repository at commit <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/tree/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">62bd831</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In scope were the following files:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">stylus-proc\n└── src\n    ├── calls\n    │   └── mod.rs\n    ├── lib.rs\n    ├── methods\n    │   ├── entrypoint.rs\n    │   ├── error.rs\n    │   ├── external.rs\n    │   └── mod.rs\n    ├── storage\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   └── proc.rs\n    └── types.rs\nstylus-sdk\n└── src\n    ├── abi\n    │   ├── bytes.rs\n    │   ├── const_string.rs\n    │   ├── export\n    │   │   ├── internal.rs\n    │   │   └── mod.rs\n    │   ├── impls.rs\n    │   ├── internal.rs\n    │   └── mod.rs\n    ├── block.rs\n    ├── call\n    │   ├── context.rs\n    │   ├── error.rs\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   ├── raw.rs\n    │   ├── traits.rs\n    │   └── transfer.rs\n    ├── contract.rs\n    ├── crypto.rs\n    ├── debug.rs\n    ├── deploy\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   └── raw.rs\n    ├── evm.rs\n    ├── hostio.rs\n    ├── lib.rs\n    ├── msg.rs\n    ├── prelude.rs\n    ├── storage\n    │   ├── array.rs\n    │   ├── bytes.rs\n    │   ├── map.rs\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   ├── traits.rs\n    │   └── vec.rs\n    ├── tx.rs\n    ├── types.rs\n    └── util.rs\nexamples\n├── erc20\n│   └── src\n│       ├── erc20.rs\n│       ├── lib.rs\n│       └── main.rs\n├── erc721\n│   └── src\n│       ├── erc721.rs\n│       ├── lib.rs\n│       └── main.rs\n└── single_call\n    └── src\n        ├── lib.rs\n        └── main.rs\nmini-alloc\n├── src\n│   ├── imp.rs\n│   └── lib.rs\n└── tests\n    └── misc.rs\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-system-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-system-overview-3\"></a>System Overview</h2>\n<p>Arbitrum Stylus introduces a paradigm shift in smart contract development by enabling programs to be compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and deployed on-chain, seamlessly coexisting with traditional smart contracts written in common EVM languages like Solidity. This language-agnostic approach opens up new possibilities for developers, enabling them to use their preferred programming languages while maintaining full ABI compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Stylus programs is their exceptional performance and cost-effectiveness. These programs are orders of magnitude cheaper and faster to execute than traditional EVM-based smart contracts while also being fully EVM compatible. This breakthrough enables Stylus programs to interact seamlessly with existing Ethereum smart contracts, creating a bridge between the efficiency of WASM and the established Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-stylus-sdk-for-rust-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-stylus-sdk-for-rust-4\"></a>Stylus SDK for Rust</h3>\n<p>This powerful toolkit enables developers to write programs for Arbitrum chains in Rust. Rust’s combination of performance, safety, and modern features makes it ideal for developing robust and efficient smart contracts. The Stylus SDK for Rust provides a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions that simplify the process of creating Stylus programs. It offers a familiar development experience for Rust programmers while integrating seamlessly with the Arbitrum ecosystem. Some of the features available in the SDK include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generic, storage-backed Rust types for programming Solidity-equivalent smart contracts with optimal storage caching.</li>\n<li>Simple macros for writing language-agnostic methods and entry points.</li>\n<li>Automatic export of Solidity interfaces for interoperability across programming languages.</li>\n<li>Powerful primitive types backed by the feature-rich Alloy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-procedural-macros-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-procedural-macros-5\"></a>Procedural Macros</h2>\n<p>The Stylus Rust SDK leverages several powerful procedural macros to streamline smart contract development and ensure seamless integration with the EVM ecosystem. These macros automate complex tasks such as trait implementation, method exposure, storage management, and inter-contract communication, allowing developers to write idiomatic Rust code while maintaining full compatibility with contracts made with EVM-compatible languages.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-entrypoint-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-entrypoint-6\"></a><code>entrypoint</code></h3>\n<p>This macro defines the entry point for Stylus execution. It implements the <code>TopLevelStorage</code> trait and is typically used to annotate the top-level storage struct. This macro sets up the necessary boilerplate for handling incoming calls, parsing calldata, and serializing results. It also manages reentrancy protection, integrating with the Stylus VM’s execution model.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-external-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-external-7\"></a><code>external</code></h3>\n<p>This macro is used to make methods “external” so that they can be called by other contracts. It implements the <code>Router</code> trait for the annotated <code>impl</code> block. The macro handles the complexities of ABI encoding and decoding, method selector generation, and integration with the Stylus VM’s calling conventions. It also manages purity annotations (<code>pure</code>, <code>view</code>, <code>payable</code>) and can infer these based on the method signature if not explicitly specified. This macro can have the <code>#[inherit]</code> attribute to implement inheritance-like behavior, allowing a contract to include methods from parent contracts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-sol_interface-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-sol_interface-8\"></a><code>sol_interface</code></h3>\n<p>It transforms Solidity interface definitions into Rust structs and methods, enabling seamless interaction with other contracts. The macro handles method generation, type conversion, function selector calculation, and call context management. It supports various call types (<code>pure</code>, <code>view</code>, and <code>payable</code>) and accommodates reentrancy concerns. By automating the creation of ABI-compatible Rust code, it simplifies cross-contract communication while maintaining type safety and idiomatic Rust practices. This macro acts as a translator, enabling Rust contracts to integrate with the broader EVM ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-solidity_storage-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-solidity_storage-9\"></a><code>solidity_storage</code></h3>\n<p>This attribute macro is applied to Rust structs to enable their use in persistent storage within a smart contract. Each field in the struct must implement the <code>StorageType</code> trait which ensures EVM storage model compatibility. Applying this macro allows developers to define storage layouts directly in Rust, with the fields mapping to the corresponding storage slots in the EVM. This macro ensures that the storage layout of the Rust structs aligns with that of Solidity, facilitating seamless upgrades and interactions with existing Solidity contracts. It supports nested structs and various storage types like <code>StorageAddress</code>, <code>StorageBool</code>, and custom types implementing <code>StorageType</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-sol_storage-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-sol_storage-10\"></a><code>sol_storage</code></h3>\n<p>This macro enables the definition of Rust structs using Solidity-like syntax. It ensures that the storage layout of these structs is identical to their Solidity counterparts. This macro simplifies the transition from Solidity to Rust by allowing developers to reuse their Solidity type definitions directly in Rust, maintaining compatibility with existing storage layouts. This macro uses <code>solidity_storage</code> macro under the hood.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-derive_solidity_error-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-derive_solidity_error-11\"></a><code>derive_solidity_error</code></h3>\n<p>This macro allows Rust enums to be used for error handling in contract methods. It enables enums to be automatically converted into Solidity-compatible error messages that can be returned by smart contract functions. Under the hood, the macro works by implementing <code>From&lt;YOUR_ERROR&gt;</code> for <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> along with printing code for <code>export-abi</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-derive_erase-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-derive_erase-12\"></a><code>derive_erase</code></h3>\n<p>This macro automatically implements the <code>Erase</code> trait for a struct. It generates an <code>erase()</code> method that calls <code>erase()</code> on each of the struct’s fields. This allows for easy clearing of complex storage structures in Arbitrum Stylus smart contracts, ensuring that all fields are properly erased without manual implementation. The macro cannot implement Erase for types that do not support it, such as mappings.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-core-modules-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-core-modules-13\"></a>Core Modules</h2>\n<p>The following modules are contained within the <code>stylus-sdk</code> folder to facilitate smart contract development and interaction with the Stylus WASM module:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-abi-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-abi-14\"></a><code>abi</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>abi</code> module provides functionality for encoding and decoding data according to the Ethereum Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification. It enables a two-way mapping between Solidity and Rust types, allowing for interoperability between Rust and Solidity contracts. The module supports encoding function calls into byte arrays and decoding contract responses back into Rust types. The <code>abi</code> module also includes utilities to generate method selectors and export Solidity interfaces, treating <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> as <code>uint8[]</code> in Solidity and using the <code>Bytes</code> type for Solidity <code>bytes</code>. This functionality is essential for communication between Rust-based smart contracts and those written in Solidity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-call-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-call-15\"></a><code>call</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>call</code> module manages interactions with external contracts by handling the execution context and providing mechanisms for standard and raw contract calls. It allows developers to specify gas limits and call values, and access contract storage. The module includes caching strategies to optimize repeated state access and features for safe execution during re-entrant calls. By managing these aspects, the <code>call</code> module enables Rust-based contracts to interact with Ethereum contracts, facilitating contract communication and data exchange.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-deploy-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-deploy-16\"></a><code>deploy</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>deploy</code> module facilitates the deployment of contracts on the Arbitrum network. It includes functionalities for both standard and raw deployments, offering flexibility and control over the deployment process. The <code>raw.rs</code> file provides lower-level deployment functions, allowing for more granular control and potentially unsafe operations. This module supports setting deployment parameters, handling the deployment process, and ensuring correct contract initialization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-storage-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-storage-17\"></a><code>storage</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>storage</code> module provides a comprehensive framework for managing smart contract storage, featuring abstractions for common data structures like arrays, bytes, maps, and vectors. It supports both basic and complex storage operations through a set of defined traits, ensuring proper data handling and access. The module allows developers to define custom storage logic by implementing the <code>StorageType</code> trait, enabling more advanced data manipulation while providing persistent storage access in the Rust-based contracts. Stylus contracts run on a virtual machine that shares the same EVM State Trie, allowing access to Ethereum’s key-value storage. The module provides types and traits for safe storage access using Rust’s borrow checker, preventing unsafe aliasing of storage.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-hostio-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-hostio-18\"></a><code>hostio</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>hostio</code> module facilitates interactions between Rust-based smart contracts and the host environment on the Arbitrum blockchain. It provides a set of functions for managing contract state, executing calls, and handling I/O operations via a foreign-function interface to the Stylus WASM VM which ultimately communicates with the core blockchain. The <code>wrap_hostio</code> macro is a key component of this module, designed to simplify and streamline the process of defining host functions. It wraps low-level host operations in Rust-safe abstractions, automatically generating bindings to interact with the blockchain. Several single-file modules in the Stylus SDK provide typical blockchain interactions extensively using the <code>wrap_hostio</code> module, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>block</code></strong>: Provides access to Ethereum block information, including properties like the block number, timestamp, and miner details. It serves as an interface for retrieving data about the current or past blocks on the blockchain.</li>\n<li><strong><code>contract</code></strong>: Facilitates interactions with other contracts, enabling function calls and access to contract metadata. It allows contracts to perform operations such as balance checks and contract code retrieval.</li>\n<li><strong><code>crypto</code></strong>: Offers cryptographic functions and utilities, such as hashing algorithms and signature verification.</li>\n<li><strong><code>evm</code></strong>: Interfaces with the EVM, managing execution resources and logging. It includes utilities to query remaining gas and ink (Stylus-specific compute units), emit logs both in raw and alloy-typed forms, and manage memory growth.</li>\n<li><strong><code>msg</code></strong>: Handles message-passing operations, providing information about the current transaction, such as the sender, value, and gas. It allows contracts to interact with transaction data and control flow.</li>\n<li><strong><code>tx</code></strong>: Provides transaction-related functionality, including accessing transaction details like gas price and origin. It enables contracts to work with transaction-specific data and execute transaction-based logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-mini-allocator-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-mini-allocator-19\"></a>Mini Allocator</h2>\n<p>This allocator is key to the Stylus ecosystem, optimized for wasm32 targets like Arbitrum Stylus. It uses a minimal bump allocator strategy, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency. Notably, mini-alloc never deallocates memory, which is ideal for scenarios with tight binary size constraints where it is acceptable to leak all allocations. This design choice enhances performance, aligning with Stylus’ focus on optimizing for blockchain environments where traditional memory management can add unnecessary overhead.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-examples-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-examples-20\"></a>Examples</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum Stylus SDK repository contains three example crates of common smart contract designs: <code>erc20</code>, <code>erc721</code>, and <code>single_call</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>erc20</code></strong>: Demonstrates an ERC-20 token contract with functionalities like minting, transferring, and checking balances. It includes methods for token transfers and managing allowances.</li>\n<li><strong><code>erc721</code></strong>: Illustrates an ERC-721 NFT contract implementation, covering minting, transferring, and querying ownership of unique tokens. It also handles token metadata and ensures compatibility with the ERC-721 standard.</li>\n<li><strong><code>single_cal</code></strong>: Showcases a simple contract for making a single call to another contract, demonstrating inter-contract communication within the Arbitrum environment using the Stylus SDK.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-trust-assumptions-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-trust-assumptions-21\"></a>Trust Assumptions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SDK Integrity</strong>: It is assumed that the Stylus SDK itself is free from malicious code, such as backdoors or other vulnerabilities that could circumvent the behavior of the underlying blockchain. The SDK is expected to function as described in its documentation, ensuring that developers can rely on its behavior as intended.</li>\n<li><strong>WASM VM and Stylus Module Compliance</strong>: It is assumed that the WASM VM and Stylus module strictly follow the consensus rules as outlined by the core EVM part of Arbitrum. This ensures that the execution within the Stylus environment is consistent with the broader consensus rules governing the Arbitrum network, maintaining the integrity and reliability of smart contract execution.</li>\n<li><strong>Third-Party Dependencies</strong>: Any third-party libraries or dependencies integrated with the Stylus SDK are trusted to be secure and regularly updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart Contract Interfaces</strong>: It is assumed that the ABIs generated by the Stylus SDK for contracts are correct and that smart contracts behave in an expected manner, similar to Solidity contracts. This means that from an external perspective, the contracts should exhibit predictable and standard behavior, ensuring compatibility and reliability for the users interacting with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-critical-severity-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-critical-severity-22\"></a>Critical Severity</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-storage-layout-is-inconsistent-with-solidity-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-storage-layout-is-inconsistent-with-solidity-23\"></a>Storage Layout is Inconsistent with Solidity</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/rust-sdk-guide#sol_storage\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documentation</a> asserts that struct fields in Stylus will map to the same storage slots as in EVM programming languages and that the layout will be identical to <a href=\"https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Solidity’s</a>. This suggests that upgrading from Solidity to Rust should not cause misalignment in storage slots, thereby implying an easy transfer of type definitions.</p>\n<p>However, Stylus does not handle inherited storage in the same manner as Solidity.

In contrast, the equivalent Stylus code uses a <code>borrow</code> clause that uses a new storage slot and does not pack the state variables, which results in a different storage layout:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"rust\"><code class=\"lang-rust\">// Snippet of parent.rs\nsol_storage! {\n    pub struct Parent {\n        bool a;\n        bool b;\n    }\n}\n\n// Snippet of lib.rs\nsol_storage! {   \n    #[entrypoint]\n    struct Child {\n        #[borrow]\n        Parent parent;\n        bool c; \n        bool d;\n    }\n}\n\n#[external]\n#[inherit(Parent)]\nimpl Child {\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Given the same value set, this results in <code>0x0101</code> being in slot 0 and <code>0x0101</code> being in slot 1.</p>\n<p>This discrepancy is critical for projects using proxy patterns that are migrating from Solidity to Stylus as it could lead to storage layout misalignment, potentially overwriting state variables.</p>\n<p>Consider refactoring the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06/stylus-proc/src/storage/mod.rs#L12\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>solidity_storage</code> macro</a> to mirror Solidity’s behavior.

These Stylus programs are compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and can be deployed on-chain to run alongside Solidity smart contracts. This innovative approach aims to combine the efficiency of WASM execution with the robustness of programming in Rust, all the while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</p>\n<p>During the security audit of the Stylus SDK, we discovered numerous security issues and also made extensive recommendations for the improvement of the overall design. The project is clearly still under development, having several features that are either non-functional or contain bugs. However, the development team showed a strong commitment to addressing these concerns and we encourage them to continue their efforts. Once all the identified issues are resolved, further improvements are made, and the project reaches a more mature stage, we strongly recommend the team to consider conducting a follow-up audit to ensure comprehensive security.</p>\n<p>Despite the current challenges, we see great potential in the Stylus SDK. We look forward to seeing how the project evolves, particularly as the team addresses the identified issues and continues to refine the SDK. We believe that further development of the Stylus SDK could introduce exciting new possibilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem and the broader world of smart contract development.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sdk-audit/26674\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sdk-audit/26674","pubDate":"Sat, 07 Sep 2024 03:19:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26674"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sdk-audit/26674.rss","#text":"Stylus SDK Audit"},"filter":false},{"title":"Delegate Incentive Program Results (AUGUST 2024)","dc:creator":"SEEDGov","category":"Delegate Incentives Program","description":"<p>We are proud to announce the initial outcomes of the fifth month of the Delegate Incentive Program.

name=\"p-57970-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h3>\n<p>OpenZeppelin, the Security Member of the ARDC, reviewed the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/enhancing-multichain-governance-upgrading-rari-governance-token-on-arbitrum/26096\">Rari multichain governance proposal</a> and its specifications. If enacted, the proposal execution will register a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract that will migrate the RARI DAO from the Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The <a href=\"https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">new token contract</a> has been fully audited and deployed to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet and all contracts have been manually tested.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-overview-2\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>The $RARI token that is used to govern the RARI DAO is currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradeable. However, the RARI DAO would like to upgrade its governance to allow for new features to be implemented such as snapshots and delegations. By bringing its governance to the Arbitrum ecosystem, RARI DAO would also improve the user experience through lower gas fees and increased accessibility of their system. Despite the non-upgradeability of the $RARI token, it is possible to make these changes to the governance model by using a custom gateway to register a new token contract. This proposed solution requires the Arbitrum DAO’s approval.</p>\n<p>Despite the non-upgradeability of the $RARI token, it is possible to make these changes to the governance model by using a custom gateway to register a new token contract. This proposed solution requires the Arbitrum DAO’s approval.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-57970-custom-gateway-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-custom-gateway-motivation-3\"></a>Custom Gateway Motivation</h4>\n<p>The Arbitrum chain allows for tokens to be bridged between various networks, such as between Arbitrum and Ethereum. In the case of many ERC-20 tokens, this involves associating a token contract on some other chain with a paired token contract on Arbitrum. When users wish to bridge their tokens, the tokens are escrowed in a bridge contract on the host chain, and an equal amount of tokens is minted on Arbitrum. Using <code>StandardERC20Gateway</code>, any ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainnet can be permissionlessly bridged to Arbitrum by default. However, this standard approach is not suitable for some tokens. For example, tokens accruing interest need to ensure that the rewards are dispersed properly to other chains instead of just being accrued to the bridge contract. A <strong>custom gateway system</strong> allows for specialized cross-chain asset bridging in such exceptional cases where additional bridging logic is necessary to be implemented.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum generic-custom gateway is designed as a flexible solution that is suitable for most custom needs beyond what is available using <code>StandardERC20Gateway</code>. In the case of the new $RARI token, the proposed changes include the addition of snapshotting and delegation functions, as well as the introduction of proxy-based upgradeability. According to the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum Foundation documentation</a>, this is likely the right solution for such a migration since these changes are limited in scope (as opposed to the addition of minting functionality directly on Arbitrum, for example).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-technical-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-technical-details-4\"></a>Technical Details</h3>\n<p>In order to register the new $RARI token to the custom gateway, <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the relevant steps</a> are outlined by the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Deploy your token on Arbitrum</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The new $RARI token deployed on Arbitrum should conform to the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/IArbToken.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">IArbToken</a> interface, as in the following <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/L2GatewayToken.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example implementation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Register your token on L1 to your token on L2 via the <code>L1CustomGateway</code> contract</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The $RARI token currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet should make an external call to <code>L1CustomGateway.registerTokenToL2</code>. This registration can alternatively be performed as a chain-owner registration via an Arbitrum DAO proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Register your token on L1 to the L1Gateway router</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Finally, the $RARI token deployed on the Ethereum mainnet should make an external call to <code>L1GatewayRouter.setGateway</code>. This registration can alternatively be performed as a chain-owner registration via an Arbitrum DAO proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The RARI DAO has already voted in favor of a <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/85102068202527969889208024703113668965813715410446115075088330064807449302588\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposal</a> that would deploy the custom $RARI token on Arbitrum, ensuring the completion of the first action item. The RARI DAO is now requesting registration to the <code>L1CustomGateway</code> and <code>L1GatewayRouter</code> contracts via this governance proposal. The mapping between the tokens deployed on the mainnet and the Arbitrum chain would then be updated and the RARI token would be registered to the generic-custom gateway, completing the remaining two steps in the registration process.</p>\n<p>The upgraded token contract from the proposal has also been <a href=\"https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fully audited</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The proposed changes, including registration of a new $RARI token to the generic-custom gateway, are appropriate to meet the needs of the RARI DAO. Since the currently deployed contracts are non-upgradeable and the RARI DAO wishes to add new features to their token, as well as enhance user experience, this operation is necessary. Using the standard ERC-20 gateway would not support the new desired enhancements and the changes do not require a unique, tailor-made gateway. Registering with the generic-custom gateway is a good fit for this transition.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648","pubDate":"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 18:59:25 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26648"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648.rss","#text":"RARI Multichain Governance Proposal Security Review"},"filter":false},{"title":"Lampros Labs DAO Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"Euphoria","category":"Delegate Statements","description":"<p><strong>Delegate Address:</strong> 0xA2D590FEe197C0b614Fe7c3E10303327F38C0dc3<br>\n<strong>Team Member Handles:</strong> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/blueweb\">@Blueweb</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/euphoria\">@Euphoria</a> &amp; <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/nyx\">@Nyx</a><br>\n<strong>Tally Profile:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xa2d590fee197c0b614fe7c3e10303327f38c0dc3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a><br>\n<strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://lamproslabs.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a><br>\n<strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/lamproslabsdao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Delegate Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Lampros Labs DAO is an open community of builders and governance enthusiasts committed to transparency, decentralization, and inclusivity.

While this has many benefits, it can also pose challenges in running a fair election such as electing security council members.</p>\n<p>Some of the solutions discussed below will require a direct integration into the governor while others can be supported through an integration with Flexible Voting. Both of these paths would require a governor upgrade, however an upgrade to the Core and Treasury Governors which includes Flexible Voting has already been planned for later this month.</p>\n<p>In no particular order, we evaluated five existing private voting solutions and explored three avenues of creating a new private voting solutions using relevant privacy tools. We assessed each solution by analyzing their potential tradeoffs, implementation feasibility, and effort needed to incorporate them into a DAO governance structure.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-assessment-factors-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-assessment-factors-3\"></a>Assessment Factors</h2>\n<p>To prevent major delegates from influencing election and voting results, we considered hiding the identity of the voter as the most important factor in our assessment.  Several other key factors were also considered in assessing each privacy solution:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ballot privacy: Whether the vote preference of a voter is revealed.</li>\n<li>Tallying transparency and correctness: Whether the vote is tallied in a decentralized and transparent manner</li>\n<li>Optionality and verifiability: If the voter has the choice of voting privately or in public, including the option to reveal their vote if desired.

MACI 1.0 was released in 2021 and version 2 is coming out in 2024. They have revamped the documentation and are looking to integrate it into existing projects. Currently, the clr.fund is using MACI.</p>\n<p>MACI can stand alone as a voting system. New users must deposit their tokens when signing and will create a new key pair to vote. There will need to be some customization in order to integrate MACI into the Security council governor. One other complication is that MACI relies on a trusted coordinator to gather and report the vote tally. This coordinator can decrypt votes and can choose to never conclude a round.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Private, but votes can be read by the trusted coordinator.</td>\n<td>Needs a trusted coordinator</td>\n<td>The voter cannot reveal their vote</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The project is under active development and is a promising solution despite its complexity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-semaphore-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-semaphore-5\"></a>Semaphore</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://semaphore.pse.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore</a> offers anonymous group-based signaling and can be used as a foundation to build a private voting system.

The voting groups may need frequent updates to reflect token transfers, potentially increasing complexity and gas costs. While Semaphore provides voter anonymity, it doesn’t encrypt the votes themselves, requiring additional steps for complete vote secrecy.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>A deeper look into the identity registration process, group update mechanisms, and additional vote privacy measures will be necessary to adapt it to a comprehensive private voting solution.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-57854-cicada-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-cicada-6\"></a>Cicada</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/a16z/cicada\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cicada</a> uses a time-lock puzzle scheme to delay revealing voter preferences until voting period has ended.

As the number of depositors increase the anonymity of the votes increase, and deposits should be represented in fixed numbers.

A valid proof of a deposit, and a proposal id is required to prevent double voting. Using a zero knowledge proof, depositors can generate a merkle proof without revealing their secrets. Snapshots of merkle tree roots should be stored in order to prevent late depositors to vote for a proposal that has already started.</p>\n<p>To withdraw their deposits, the users will provide their secrets and will be able to withdraw back to the original depositor address that corresponds to the deposit commitment hash. Although all the technological pieces for this solution exist, and have been proven to work in other contexts, a  non-trivial amount of work would be required to put them together to construct production-ready privacy preserving voting. Nonetheless, this approach seems promising, as the work needed is primarily engineering work, rather than fundamental research…</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-stealth-voting-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-stealth-voting-11\"></a>Stealth voting</h3>\n<p>Another possible bespoke solution is a voting system that utilizes stealth addresses via ERC-5564 and ERC-6538. This implementation will require a trusted coordinator that is responsible for holding private keys corresponding stealth meta-addresses and tallying votes correctly.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Needs a trusted coordinator</td>\n<td>Can be optional with an additional governance extension contract</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h4><a name=\"p-57854-implementation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-implementation-12\"></a>Implementation</h4>\n<p>The basic idea is that a trusted coordinator will generate stealth meta-addresses corresponding to each option in a proposal. And anyone can announce their vote preference for a given proposal by including a stealth address generated using one of the stealth meta-addresses. Once the voting period ends, the trusted coordinator can tally the announcements each stealth meta-address owner has received, and output the winning option.</p>\n<p>This implementation would have the usual benefits that comes with stealth addresses. Voters can vote without an extra step and with their full voting weight, but their vote preference is linked to the stealth address’ hidden owner. There’s no liquidity concern as long as your voting weight can be queried from the token. The trusted coordinator portion could potentially be improved by incorporating a zero knowledge proof step to prove that tallying was done correctly. The governor will need to be upgraded to accept tallying results and an extension could be added to overwrite the behaviors of the default <code>castVote</code> function.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-railgun-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-railgun-13\"></a>Railgun</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.railgun.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Railgun</a> as it is now offers transaction anonymity, meaning the identity of the sender, recipient, token, and amount remain private once onboarded onto the system with new private key pairs. Critically, Railgun allows those who have deposited into the privacy pool to interact with external contracts by submitting zero knowledge proofs. Wallet software must be developed to construct the proofs for specific external calls and forward them to Railguns relayer network. The Railgun protcol charges a fee for each transaction sent in this manner.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Customizing or creating a solution based on Railgun might prove challenging while introducing new reliance on the existing Railgun infrastructure. It still is a great privacy framework to keep in mind and Railgun SDK could help with this process. Bridging the gap between its current implementation and unique requirements of an onchain governance system will require significant research and effort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-conclusion-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-conclusion-14\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our assessment of existing private voting solutions concludes that although there are several projects and tools that enable private voting, none of them are plug and play with Arbitrum DAO’s existing governance system. Any effort to add private voting would require additional effort to integrate a privacy solution with a new customized governor.</p>\n<p>We provided different trade-offs and it’s crucial to seek DAO members’ input on implementing an onchain private voting solution, their priorities and preferences, including voter anonymity, result verifiability, and potential trade-offs.</p>\n<p>We recommend the DAO to further explore the proposed new approaches when considering how to bring private voting to the security council election processes. In particular, the Shieled Pool solution seems the most promising in terms of a system that could be producitionized with a reasonable amount of effort, yet has minimal tradeoffs as it relates to privacy properties. Nonetheless, such an effort would require significant resource to be dedicated to developing proof of concepts, further research, audits and bug bounties.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-partial-delegation-solutions-assessments-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-partial-delegation-solutions-assessments-15\"></a>Partial Delegation Solutions Assessments</h2>\n<p>The current delegation structure limits token holders to delegating their voting power to a single address. To enhance flexibility and empower token holders, we explored various solutions that enable delegation to multiple addresses. In this document, we aim to highlight the key trade-offs associated with each solution, providing a comprehensive analysis to guide decision-making</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-assessment-factors-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-assessment-factors-16\"></a>Assessment Factors</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Separate vote flow: Whether the solution allows a token holder to submit the paritial delegation vote using one of the Governor’s cast vote methods.</li>\n<li>Loss of liquidity: Whether the solution requires the delegator to deposit the ERC20Votes token into a contract in order to partially delegate their votes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-franchiser-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-franchiser-17\"></a>Franchiser</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Franchiser</a> was developed by the Noah Zinmeister to allow token holders to delegate their voting power across multiple addresses. It works by having a user deposit the funds into a Franchiser contract that delegates them to the desired delegate. This system allows for the tokens to also be redelegated to another franchiser address.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Separate Vote flow</th>\n<th>Loss of liquidity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-57854-paritial-delegation-erc20votes-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-paritial-delegation-erc20votes-18\"></a>Paritial Delegation ERC20Votes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/voteagora/ERC20VotesPartialDelegationUpgradeable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">This solution</a> was developed by Agora with help from ScopeLift. It overrides the ERC20Votes token contract to allow a token holder to delegate to multiple addresses. It maintains the voting flow and does not cause the token holder to lose liquidity. Some drawbacks: it increases gas costs for token transfers, would require a token upgrade for Arbitrum, and does not support subdelegation.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Separate Vote flow</th>\n<th>Loss of liquidity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-57854-conclusion-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-conclusion-19\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Among the solutions explored, the Partial Delegation ERC20Votes contract offers a balanced set of trade-offs for the Arbitrum DAO. It enables token holders to delegate voting power to multiple addresses without losing liquidity and maintains the existing voting flow. Although, it requires a token upgrade and introduces higher gas costs for token transfers, these issues are not a deal breaker because Arbitrum’s token is upgradeable and the token existing on Arbitrum makes gas costs less of a concern. Additionally, the absence of sub-delegation support is not a critical limitation for the current needs of the DAO. Therefore, this solution aligns well with the DAO’s objectives for improved governance flexibility.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-references-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-references-20\"></a>References</h2>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/icon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"64\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore Demo</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a65b4bbcb6742b2b016fcc9d20faaba397072d77_2_690x362.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"13193A\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore Demo</a></h3>\n\n  <p>A zero-knowledge protocol for anonymous signaling on Ethereum.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<p><a href=\"https://projects.ethberlin.org/submissions/334\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://projects.ethberlin.org/submissions/334</a></p><aside class=\"onebox githubrepo\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\" data-github-private-repo=\"false\">\n  <img width=\"690\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b7ab5d00b81bea8be24673a3e4d6e172df72c1d4_2_690x344.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEAEA\">\n\n  <h3><a href=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig: Implementation of PLUME: nullifier friendly...</a></h3>\n\n    <p><span class=\"github-repo-description\">Implementation of PLUME: nullifier friendly signature scheme on ECDSA</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://research.aragon.org/img/main-logo.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">research.aragon.org</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/388;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/ac25e645cdcb672e291b803805ff01d91fde1202_2_690x388.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"B8A3ED\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Nouns Private Voting Research Sprint - General Report - Aragon ZK Research -...</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Nouns sprint report</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/edf96faf9653815ad054301e915997f2bf67ee6d.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"000000\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" title=\"12:00AM - 12 December 2023\">blog.rs – 12 Dec 23</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8605049b519148caab57e1f7c879f9589419ba47_2_500x500.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"4C4943\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The State of Private Voting in Ethereum</a></h3>\n\n  <p>The State of Private Voting in Ethereum and beyond.

As the leading scaling tech stack, we view Arbitrum as best primed to deliver on this vision and have therefore committed to work exclusively with the Arbitrum DAO. Our team is composed of crypto natives, with previous experience at Blockworks Research and 404 DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57846-delegate-statement-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57846-delegate-statement-2\"></a>Delegate Statement</h3>\n<p>Our primary objective for the Arbitrum DAO is to ensure that the Arbitrum tech stack becomes the most widely adopted infrastructure in the entire blockchain ecosystem. We envision a world where investors, users, and developers focus on contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem without even making the conscious decision to do so, primarily because the network effects have grown so exponentially that “Why Arbitrum?” is no longer a question being asked. We believe the Arbitrum tech speaks for itself in practice, and that with proper stewardship and contributions to the Arbitrum DAO, the aforementioned question will turn into “Why not Arbitrum?”.</p>\n<p>We are interested in contributing to all areas of the Arbitrum ecosystem as needs arise, but will be focusing on improving governance participation as well as tooling and protocol decentralization. The Arbitrum DAO is Entropy Advisors’ only customer, which is not something many other Arbitrum delegates can tout today. Our employees have extensive experience in research and have been active across numerous DAOs in the past, but have identified Arbitrum as the most promising technology stack and want to put all of our time, effort, and collective brainpower into ensuring the sustainable growth of the ecosystem – powered by the Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<p>Put simply, we believe in a diverse and highly capable delegate base, a DAO that is sustainable through diversified and robust revenue streams, responsible and carefully calculated spending that encourages the growth of the ecosystem, a highly intellectual group of service providers that can effectively execute on tasks on behalf of the DAO, and measures for accountability/processes that can stand the test of time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57846-conflicts-of-interest-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57846-conflicts-of-interest-3\"></a>Conflicts of Interest</h3>\n<p>Entropy Advisors often authors or is directly involved in several proposals within Arbitrum DAO.

rxpwnz, currently serving as a community manager and technical moderator for the Hop Protocol, a role I’ve dedicated myself to for nearly three years. My responsibilities extend across several critical areas including operational security (OpSec), community support, troubleshooting, bug and vulnerability reporting, and more. Additionally, I have been a part of the Community Multisig committee at Hop Protocol for over a year, contributing to key governance decisions and securing community funds. I believe my unique blend of experience in these areas makes me an excellent candidate for the Security Council.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational Security (OpSec):</strong> In my current role, I prioritize the safety and security of our community members across all platforms, from Discord to our Forum, and beyond into broader web security. My proactive approach to OpSec has led to the elimination of over 150 phishing websites impersonating Hop Protocol, achieved by reporting these threats to MetaMask, various domain registrar providers, and Google.</p>\n<p>During a significant security incident involving our Discord server, where a moderator’s account was compromised, I acted swiftly to contain the breach. By disabling the compromised account’s access within minutes, I ensured that the impact on our community was minimal. This swift response was made possible by implementing a least privilege access model, which I advocate for and enforce rigorously.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Support &amp; Troubleshooting:</strong> Beyond security, I am deeply involved in providing community support and troubleshooting issues as they arise. This includes identifying and reporting bugs and vulnerabilities that could affect the user experience or the security of the platform. My hands-on approach ensures that our community remains engaged, informed, and secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Background in DevOps:</strong> In addition to my work in the crypto space, I bring a strong background as a DevOps engineer with a specialization in production incident resolution. My experience spans handling critical incidents during both regular business hours and 24/7 on-call shifts. I have led cross-team war rooms during critical incidents and have conducted thorough root cause analyses to prevent future occurrences.</p>\n<p><strong>Why I’m a Fit for the Security Council:</strong> My extensive experience in operational security within the Hop Protocol community, combined with my technical expertise in DevOps, positions me uniquely to contribute meaningfully to the Security Council. I am passionate about safeguarding our community and have a proven track record of taking proactive measures to mitigate risks and address threats swiftly.</p>\n<p>I look forward to the opportunity to bring my experience, dedication, and proactive mindset to the Security Council, ensuring the continued safety and resilience of our community.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631","pubDate":"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 16:34:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26631"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631.rss","#text":"Rxpwnz - Candidate for Security Council Elections 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"Arbitrum Offsite format: online vs IRL","dc:creator":"danielo","category":"Proposals","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-57826-arbitrumdao-off-site-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-arbitrumdao-off-site-1\"></a>ArbitrumDAO Off-site</h1>\n<p>Non-Constitutional</p>\n<p>This proposal is a continuation of the directional proposal for an offsite which was voted in favour with 130mn ARB in Snapshot: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site-directional-proposal/25660\" class=\"inline-onebox\">ArbitrumDAO Off-site - Directional proposal</a></p>\n<p>IMPORTANT:<br>\nPlease vote based on the format selection.

The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured event will be organized in Q4, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.</p>\n<p>This proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to prioritise the most important agenda items to be discussed at the evente, ensuring the meeting time is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The event will then include professional facilitation to advance alignment, remove blockers, ensure proper note-taking, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.</p>\n<p>The success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem</h2>\n<p>The DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.</p>\n<p>Areas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to test a format for deliberation between key stakeholders with a clearly defined agenda. If successful, the format can be replicated to continuously address agenda items.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution</h2>\n<p>Recent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for focused events to catalyse progress.

As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the meeting is effective. The facilitation includes designing the workshops and moderating the conversation, AND thinking through how to create a strategic process for a DAO.<br>\nCosts of Online facilitation might be lower than IRL. We’ll confirm this before the onchain proposal, for now costs are indicative to select a direction.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-agenda-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-agenda-11\"></a>Agenda</h3>\n<p>We’ve already started the process of setting the agenda. We ran a survey, answered by 29 delegates with 86mn+ ARB represented. And then ran SimScore (a collective intelligence algorithm) to cluster responses and identify the key topics. The results are presented below to encourage further discussion.</p>\n<p>Pre-selection of topics (to be refined and prioritised after the format is defined):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defining strategic priorities for the DAO (vision and strategy)</li>\n<li>DAO Budget (how much should the DAO be spending)</li>\n<li>Org Design</li>\n<li>ARB token utility</li>\n<li>Conflict Of Interest</li>\n<li>Grant programs (RPGF, what should be the focus, outcomes, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional work to be done to define the agenda:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 workshops and async discussion to identify root causes (root topics) and prioritise.</li>\n<li>The final agenda will be defined via a subsequent Snapshot vote facilitated by the project manager.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-hybrid-participation-for-irl-events-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-hybrid-participation-for-irl-events-12\"></a>Hybrid Participation for IRL events</h3>\n<p>We’ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost about $600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties. The online setup is of course less good than being IRL but it is still viable to contribute to sessions (anyone leading a session does need to be IRL but, for input in the discussion, online works).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-attendees-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-attendees-13\"></a>Attendees</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on high-context, expert, and senior participants.

Each allocation is carefully crafted for maximum impact, always taking into account available co-incentive schemes and experimenting with different distribution methods and target APYs.</p>\n<p>The delay can be attributed to two factors:<br>\n(1) some ARB was earmarked for integrations with Silo, Spectra, and CreditGuild, which are only now ready to start. And additionally for a further integration with Aave GHO, who is requesting a similar <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-aave-dao-ltipp-grant-extension-request/26612\">extension</a>.</p>\n<p>(2) Similarly, in addition to the rollout of the yield-bearing version, sGYD, a dedicated staking infrastructure was developed that only went live last week.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Generally, the LTIPP grant has been a great success for Gyroscope. ARB is being used to incentivize the use of the GYD meta-stablecoin and to encourage the adoption of Gyroscope’s concentrated liquidity AMMs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gyroscope pools saw a large capital inflow. In the latest period from Aug-26-to-date, the average TVL of Gyroscope pools with ARB incentives was <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3923512\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">11m USD</a>.  Gyroscope’s TVL on Arbitrum grew from 1.48m to 16.7m <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3993279/6720961\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">over the course of LTIPP</a> so far.</li>\n<li>The stablecoin GYD has also seen a lot of adoption on Arbitrum due to ARB incentives. The newly launched yield-bearing version, sGYD, has 70% of its entire supply on Arbitrum, with the remaining 30% being on Ethereum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The remaining 20274.4285716 ARB are planned to be used to bootstrap additional use-cases of sGYD on Arbitrum (via, for example, a Spectra yield-market), generally encourage (s)GYD adoption, and further incentivize Gyroscope AMMs that are coming to market now. Gyroscope plans to match incentives on Arbitrum after LTIPP through sGYD yield sharing mechanisms, SPIN points, and SPIN for Balancer incentive votes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant an extension on deadline to allocate remaining ARB from LTIPP Grant for Gyroscope to allocate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The extension will utilize the remaining ARB tokens from our original proposal for liquidity mining on Gyroscope.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-steps-to-implement-6\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The last, missing integrations with other Arbitrum DeFi participants are very close to being concluded. Even if they were to fail, key infrastructure is in place and existing incentive channels are showing great success.</li>\n<li>Additional time to allow the last integrations to come in and continue to carefully allocate incentives for maximum impact is all that is needed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-timeline-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-timeline-7\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Start Date: September 2nd 2024</li>\n<li>End Date: October 2nd 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-overall-cost-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-overall-cost-8\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p>The extension utilizes the remaining ARB tokens from the originally approved 100k ARB grant.
