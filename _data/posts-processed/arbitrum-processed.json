In this capacity, the ADPC bears the responsibility of diligently executing the steps essential to implement the aforementioned procurement framework in a manner characterized by transparency and efficiency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The ADPC is currently in the process of setting up the procurement framework RFP to whitelist security service providers for the DAO.</li>\n<li>The RFP includes a Framework Agreement which outlines detailed considerations around general provisions of the framework, administration of the framework, financial provisions, personnel, information management, risk management, IP rights, termination and dispute, delivery, security, and reporting. The RFP also includes an Order Form and Contract Details for all applicants.</li>\n<li><strong>The first draft of the RFP has been created and is currently being vetted and reviewed internally by the ADPC.</strong></li>\n<li>The aim is for the ADPC to publish the RFP by May 1, with applications needing to be submitted 4 weeks after the RFP being published and a subsequent review period consisting of 4 weeks, which will be a rolling process where the ADPC will approve applicants through the course of this period. <strong>We aim to have the service providers white-listed by the end of June.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/two.png?v=12\" title=\":two:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":two:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> The ADPC will be tasked with researching &amp; drafting a proposal to the ArbitrumDAO to set up a subsidy-fund for security-oriented services that will be used to subsidize the costs for security-services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958/15\">Subsidy Fund proposal</a> has been drafted and shared with the DAO. The proposal is up for vote on <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd45c0426919353cbce3e7e2a3e7a00c01f9d606bb7ed6c9788db4598f044b16a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a>.

This ‘Means Test’ (as referred to in traditional administrative practices), will be bundled in with the proposal that will set up the subsidy fund referred to in [b]. The Means Test will be used to assess whether a project is eligible for security service-fee subsidies. Initially, this methodology will only be applied to security-oriented services. However, this does not preclude the application of this same concept to other verticals within the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Means Test is included as part of the Subsidy Fund proposal and you can find it in the same forum post.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/four.png?v=12\" title=\":four:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":four:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> The ADPC will be tasked with establishing procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service-types that the ArbitrumDAO could need in the foreseeable future. This proactive approach towards procurement will naturally aid in ensuring that projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem have immediate access to high-quality whitelisted service providers when the need arises. In this regard, all procurement frameworks developed by the ADPC will need to be ratified through a Snapshot vote by the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given our focus on establishing the procurement framework for security service providers and creating the Subsidy Fund, we have not worked on establishing any other procurement frameworks yet. However, we are in conversations with BlockScience to take the findings of their <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/blockscience-report-arbitrum-expert-service-provider-network-program-development/22687\">report</a> to develop Expert Service Provider Networks for Arbitrum forward and identify the best process for outlining the next procurement frameworks for the DAO to create. As these conversations become more advanced, we will provide further updates on this thread.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/five.png?v=12\" title=\":five:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":five:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> The ADPC will be tasked with creating &amp; communicating guidance notes &amp; circulars that will substantiate &amp; provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The aim of these guidance notes &amp; circulars is to provide prospective applicants going through the procurement process with the necessary information that would enable them to satisfactorily complete the steps of the corresponding procurement framework.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are currently in the process of creating guidance notes and circulars alongside the RFP and will publish these in due course.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"ii-timeline-and-open-items-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ii-timeline-and-open-items-2\"></a>II.

We set out to boost the visibility of budding Arbitrum projects that were flying under the radar, and we achieved this with WOOFi’s cross-chain carousel which spotlighted 13 builders over 13 consecutive weeks. This initiative alone triggered 18,347 cross-chain swaps into the ecosystem and showcased some of the attention-starved gems innovating at Arbitrum’s application layer.</p>\n<p>We led more collaborative efforts when we teamed up with Layer3, GMX, Trader Joe, Radiant Capital, Silo Finance, and Camelot to launch WOOFi’s Quest for the Holy Grail of Arbitrum. This campaign was designed to reward users who completed the quest collection with the Holy Grail NFT, giving each holder a guaranteed share of 25,000 ARB. Originally slated to go live on March 5th, the initiative was postponed due to a WOOFi Swap pricing exploit but is still scheduled to go ahead in May.</p>\n<p>Concerning WOOFi specifically, data shows that our metrics boomed from the incentives. Not only did the TVL of WOOFi Earn Arbitrum vaults more than triple from $4.6m to $15.2m, but staked WOO also jumped from 19m to 35.6m, with 3,300 new stakers on Arbitrum. In tandem, perps flourished as WOOFi Pro 7-day volumes more than 100xed from $13.3m in late December 2023 to $1.36B in early March. In this same period, cumulative WOOFi Pro users multiplied by more than a factor of 8 from 5,429 to 45,867.</p>\n<p>Prior to the pricing exploit in early March, WOOFi Swap also observed 24-hour all-time-highs across the board with regard to swap volume ($61.7m), swap fees ($14,381), DAU (17,951), and number of swaps (21,449). It should therefore come as no surprise that Arbitrum is now home to more WOO token holders (47,666) than any other chain, surpassing even the token’s birthplace, Ethereum (19,932).</p>\n<p><strong>6. [Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We should ensure rewards are proportional to the $ value that users contribute to prevent sybil attacks. This will also make the incentives more efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h2>\n<p><strong>7.

(builders) within the Arbitrum ecosystem, it turned into a cat-and-mouse game across the ecosystem as yield competition was fierce and liquidity was high in demand.</p>\n<p>Trader Joe had an aim to concentrate large incentives in markets for shorter periods of time and then halt incentives, with the outcome expected to be strong liquidity accrual that can go on to self-sustain with fees post incentives, thus demonstrating a sustainable approach to liquidity mining, as opposed to an always on approach. However, the intense competition within the ecosystem made this more difficult to carry through.</p>\n<p>The lesson learned here is that instead of spreading efforts across a wide range of protocols and focusing on a rotating program that keeps rewards concentrated and over short periods, Trader Joe will instead double down on TJ exclusive partnerships to collaborate more with the wider ecosystem and to avoid yield competition against competing DEXs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a><strong>New Plans for STIP Bridge</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>50% of the STIP - 750,500 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>YES and NO (some small adjustments/changes - but nothing major)</p>\n<p><strong>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>Ultimately the same core mechanisms of incentivization (MM program and Auto-Pool Farms) remain the same but with some adjustments to the overarching plan based on learnings from the STIP.

This feature will allow a decentralized distribution of LTIPP rewards to wallets that represent a valuable segment to DeFi protocols and Arbitrum Ecosystem. It can also be used for on-chain airdrops to guarantee a ROE-positive and fully measurable distribution of rewards.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"ga4-mixpanel-integration-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ga4-mixpanel-integration-9\"></a>GA4 / Mixpanel integration</h4>\n<p>Feature allowing to finally bring performance marketing campaigns with positive ROI to web3 space. Most DeFi &amp; dApps already have GA4 installed in order to understand which inbound channels bring in most users and which campaigns have the lowest CAC (‘customer acquisition cost’). Connecting this data with Tokenguard will allow to measure user LTV (‘lifetime value’) and finally understand which campaigns have LTV &gt; CAC.</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://app.tokenguard.io/dapp-ranking\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tokenguard.io</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tokenguard_io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/Tokenguard_io</a><br>\nMail: <a href=\"mailto:dev@tokenguard.io\">dev@tokenguard.io</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ltipp-improving-efficiency-and-roe-with-conversion-growth-tool/23319\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ltipp-improving-efficiency-and-roe-with-conversion-growth-tool/23319","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Apr 2024 18:20:43 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23319"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ltipp-improving-efficiency-and-roe-with-conversion-growth-tool/23319.rss","#text":"LTIPP: Improving efficiency and ROE with conversion growth tool"},"filter":false},{"title":"Gamma STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"strategicreserve","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c49d516a200fd9c3a7adbc1a9ee29d20b05a67b2.webp\" alt=\"spaces_-MWyc-TFyZIzH7aDRnpp_uploads_gGXVYvsrRHzd443IcEFB_imageedit_82_3888171993 (1)\" data-base62-sha1=\"s3kDsNliZHYLd2CmwjMh17HaaOK\" width=\"382\" height=\"60\"></p>\n<p>Welcome to Gamma’s STIP Addendum.

The time constraints for ETH CC have led us to propose funding solely for this event in hopes of an expedient proposal process prior to asking the DAO for a larger funding package that ensures a long-term and optimal solution for Arbitrum DAO’s event participation.</p>\n<p>GovHack Brussels aims to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build trust and deepen relationships between Arbitrum contributors</li>\n<li>Ideate and later implement proposals that benefit Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Attract new talent to the DAO</li>\n<li>Position Arbitrum as the go-to home for talent to build and the DAO as a world-class operation maturing and innovating at the forefront of decentralized governance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GovHack Brussels, improves on and expands GovHack ETHDenver with additional prize pool, the introduction of a subsidy pool for high-value contributors, enhancing and running a proper community showcase day, and adding a dedicated afterparty.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>In a world of remote work, decentralized technology, and decentralized finance, the human social-layer needs intentional facilitation and development to mature and enable building this next paradigm of technology and new ways of working together. Online collaboration can only get us so far. A key competitive advantage for the ArbitrumDAO is strategically investing in growing a high-trust network of talented contributors, delegates, service providers, and builders on Arbitrum. GovHack ETHDenver proved the thesis that in-person opportunities for the DAO to work together represent a significant competitive advantage for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pitch.com/v/arbitrum-govhack----ethdenver-v21-ngcy5r\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4fec995f9c5fa12ec06eacbfd88bd65104c776a9.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"bp2D9dT7xxadrzKdKO7i2do9dGN\" width=\"624\" height=\"331\" role=\"presentation\"></a></p>\n<p>If you are aiming to learn more about what GovHack aims to achieve, please check out their ETHDenver:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pitch.com/v/arbitrum-govhack----ethdenver-v21-ngcy5r\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pitch</a> deck<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Bt-wQt8sE\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Bt-wQt8sE</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/23239\">Impact Report</a> - 9.1 star rating and 67% NPS from participants</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@HackHumanity/playlists\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Media production</a></li>\n<li>Aftermovie:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Bt-wQt8sE\">GovHack Aftermovie - ETHDenver 2024 - Powered by Hack Humanity</a></p>\n\n<p>Hack Humanity, was previously funded with a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to host GovHack ETHDenver.

ETH CC is an Ethereum-focused event, and Arbitrum should lean into that given its status as the leading Ethereum L2. These events provide substantial value, such as brand strengthening, community building, attracting developer talent, in-person ideation, and more.</p>\n<p>Many hackathons cost north of $1M with smart contract base layers like Near, zkSync, Avalanche, and others throwing events/hackathons with more than 1000 participants. It’s important Arbitrum remains competitive with these other protocols to ensure its ability to attract talent.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>GovHack will run for three days, boast a prize pool of $20k for GovHack participants, have t-shirts and other swag for attendees to get their hands on, and pre, mid, and post-event media production and storytelling to represent the voice of the DAO and to amplify the event on social platforms.</p>\n<p>GovHack is 3 events in 1: A 2-day hackathon-style bootcamp, followed by a 1-day Community Showcase, followed by an afterparty. Hack Humanity is looking to build on GovHack ETHDenver’s success and coevolve with the DAO over the long term.</p>\n<p><strong>For GovHack Brussels a full impact report and transparency around the event and its cost will be posted in the forum following its completion.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-6\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<p>Once spending is approved by the DAO, funds will be sent to a ⅔ multisig to be converted into dollars. These dollars will be used to pay for the costs associated with running and organizing the event. Hack Humanity will provide event details on the forum so that the entire community can participate in the event’s scope and execution.</p>\n<p>50% of the funds will be paid to Hack Humanity upon this proposal’s approval. An additional 35% will be disbursed the week before the event, and the final 15% will be disbursed after the event concludes.</p>\n<p>The 3 multisig signers will be: Klaus + Abdullah Umar (Arana Digital) + Krzysztof Urbański</p>\n<p><strong>Any excess funds from the $309k that are not spent on the Brussels event will be rolled over and used to fund future Arbitrum events, but only if the DAO votes to spend additional funds on future events before the end of August.

Hack Humanity intends to produce a subsequent proposal to provide a year-round program of events on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO, this will require a larger funding package, with a component to cover a full-time team &amp; and a component for an event budget to cover a series of IRL events. Hack Humanity needs the ability to hire and maintain a dedicated team committed to Arbitrum, this uniquely enables high-context, up to date and relevant continual program design in lockstep with the needs of Arbitrum’s roadmap and community needs, it also enables Hack Humanity and team to commit and block calendar dates for future events 6-12 months in advance, secure venues, and team member’s time. This requires upfront funding.</p>\n<p>Expect another proposal for further funding in the coming months.

This proposal does NOT seek to transfer any large funds, only enough to elect, empower and compensate dealmakers who upload token swap agreements on Tally for ArbitrumDAO to directly approve.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong> - This is the second of the Stable Treasury Endowment Program proposals put forth by the Treasury Working Group, formed in September ‘23 with a mandate to propose best in class solutions for diversifying Arbitrums treasury, currently containing ~3.5 billion ARB.</p>\n<p>Token swaps are a form of treasury diversification that increases Arbitrum alignment of protocols. In our view, token swaps should be the final stage of ecosystem support by the DAO, which could begin with a small Questbook grant and finally graduate to a direct token swap with us.<br>\n.<br>\n<strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p><em>A. Ecosystem Growth</em> : We see broadly three categories of projects that would benefit from and apply for token swaps</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Builders: Some founders, such as Susruth Nadimpalli of Catalog (Ren Protocol), were seeking an L2 they could devote themselves to. A token swap emerged as one way to ensure they build on our chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mature Apps: Many of the top apps in Arbitrum have their own token. Although some of them have ARB in their treasuries because of the airdrop, we do not possess any of their tokens. We think ARB DAO should seriously think of getting a nonzero amount of the top tokens in our ecosystem to promote closer integration with successful dapps on our chain and more generally create positive sentiment in the ARB ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Orbit Adoption: The third category consist of big players that want to launch their own Orbit L2 or appchain. For example, Celo is researching a tech stack for their chains. A token swap deal can help cement their decision of choosing Orbit over its competitors for their L2.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>More broadly, getting a voice in the apps in our ecosystem may prove critical in the future for ensuring they remain Arbitrum aligned (such as by voting against their migration from our chain). At the same time, for it to truly be an ecosystem growth initiative, we need to ensure it doesn’t appear that the DAO is picking winners and that the source of tokens we receive in the swap is not from the founder encashing their holdings but a community treasury with clear guidelines on holding periods.</p>\n<p><em>B. Treasury Diversification</em> : The first proposal by our WG diversified our treasury into stable RWAs such as tokenized t-bills, while helping with ecosystem support through the DAO being a customer of such products built on our chain. The present token swap proposal takes this one step further by becoming more closely integrated with apps in our ecosystem through owning their tokens.</p>\n<p>More generally, we do not think apps that have launched their own token should be receiving large grants from ArbitrumDAO. People will always line up for free money; but when they have to give something in return such as their token, they would be more judicious about the amounts they are requesting.</p>\n<p>Some of the risks to take care of are avoiding what happened to FTX with their <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/QmXKDH8U54wHgKGUpeC3iR3UxF1ZQekADCQtM5crafnptF\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BitDAO token swap</a>. After $BIT migrated their token and became $MNT, they <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x00625c4f2d9aa9d4efb41ef3d0942194ca2087fae0599deced8b8ed86372c6c2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">invalidated</a> all tokens held by the FTX estate by preventing their exchange. We also want to prevent one sided deals where we hold in perpetuity while the other side liquidates ARB received. In the future, a DAO treasury manager could keep tabs on alt tokens in our treasury and recommend or even unilaterally hold power to liquidate them with an explanation to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<p>One big issue with token swaps are price increases upon announcement of a deal. We want to mitigate this issue by the elected dealmakers making the announcement of projects shortlisted via an onchain proposal on Tally, with the applicant locking in terms of the deal using Hedgey’s token swap escrow tool and Arbitrum DAO accepting or rejecting the deal via a direct onchain Tally vote.</p>\n<p>All shortlisted applicants will need to undergo KYC with the Foundation, before any deal is uploaded on Tally.</p>\n<p>We would also let dealmakers negotiate the vesting lengths, lockup periods and other details, which would vary depending on the applicants requirement (a builder seeking a token swap would be different from one launching their orbit chain and wanting a voice in governance).</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Snapshot approval of the proposal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Elections for dealmakers held on Snapshot</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tally vote approving or rejecting the dealmakers elected in the Snapshot poll and transferring remuneration to them (in case the DAO is not satisfied with the candidates or changes its mind, they can reject the proposal at this stage).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dealmakers put out an RFP for projects to apply for token swaps with Arbitrum DAO</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shortlisted applicants complete KYC, lock up their tokens in escrow and dealmakers upload the deal on Tally ; if passed, tokens are swapped between our treasuries and if rejected, applicant gets back their tokens.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>\n<p>April : Solicit comments and feedback on the proposal</p>\n<p>May : Put forth a Snapshot vote and if successful, invite applications for people to become ARB DAO dealmakers</p>\n<p>June : Snapshot election for appointing dealmakers</p>\n<p>July : Onchain tally vote to authorize and pay elected dealmakers</p>\n<p>August-October: RFP for DAOs seeking token swaps + search and review of applicants</p>\n<p>November: Submission window closes and KYC checks for shortlisted candidates</p>\n<p>December : Upload deals for the DAO to vote on Tally</p>\n<p>January : Vote on continuation of the program or its disbanding</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong> : 210,000 ARB</p>\n<p>We are still working out the right amount of pay and seek feedback from the DAO and interested candidates in the position. We propose 35k ARB to each of the 5 dealmakers and the Treasury WG as facilitating, nonvoting member except in tie-breaks (upper range should be 50k and lower 20k)</p>\n<p>35,000 x 6 = 210,000 ARB</p>\n<p>This will be the only incurred cost in the proposal, as the DAO will directly approve or reject any token swap deal uploaded to Tally.</p>\n<p>We are keeping a soft target of uploading token swap deals worth at least 10 million ARB before seeking additional funds for continuation of the program. 2% of this amount for implementation is reasonable by industry standards , especially considering the power these dealmakers have.</p>\n<p>As a concluding note, we would highlight that it is not terribly important whether these deals are approved or rejected, just that apps in our ecosystem are aware of Arbitrum’s token swap ecosystem support program that they may one day benefit from.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-arbitrum-treasury-token-swap-program/23303\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-arbitrum-treasury-token-swap-program/23303","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Apr 2024 14:01:50 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23303"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-arbitrum-treasury-token-swap-program/23303.rss","#text":"Proposal [Non-Constitutional] Arbitrum Treasury Token Swap Program"},"filter":false},{"title":"AIP: Support RIP-7212 for Account Abstraction Wallets","dc:creator":"Arbitrum","category":"Proposals","description":"<h1><a name=\"constitutional-proposal-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#constitutional-proposal-1\"></a><strong>Constitutional proposal</strong></h1>\n<h2><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This proposal adopts <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md\">RIP-7212</a> (Rollup Improvement Proposal), a precompile for verifying the <a href=\"https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/what_is_secp256r1\">secp256r1 curve</a> on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Other major L2s have committed to adopting RIP-7212. Adding support for this precompile would enable account abstraction wallets to cheaply verify a type of signature widely used in passkeys and secure enclaves.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Wallet security is one of the most prominent pain points for crypto users today. Adopting RIP-7212 will reduce the costs of using passkey-based wallets on Arbitrum One and Nova, making them more feasible for everyday use and enabling dApp developers and protocols to offer their users improved UX.</p>\n<p>Passkey-based wallets offer a better level of security than a typical EOA and seamless cross-device support. Specifically, adding this precompile will reduce the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve for account abstraction wallets. Passkeys offer a solution that removes the need for personally storing a private key. They leverage WebAuthn, a global standard for passwordless authentication used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and all major web browsers. The private key generated when creating a passkey can be encrypted and then stored in the iCloud Keychain (or the Android Keystore for Android devices). The decryption of the private keys happens in a specialized module located in every iPhone (and other smartphones) called the Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave ensures a user’s private key can never leave the device, transforming a smartphone into a hardware wallet. Users can authorize transactions with biometric features like Touch ID or Face ID when using passkey-based wallets for key management. These qualities add flexibility and significantly improve UX while maintaining high security.</p>\n<p>Ethereum currently has a precompile for the <a href=\"https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/secp256k1_a_key%20algorithm_(explainCKBot)\">secp25k1</a> curve, which all EOA wallets use as their signature scheme. Account abstraction wallets can use alternative signature schemes, such as the one that passkeys utilize: secp256r1. Without a precompile, verifying this signature onchain is extremely expensive. Adding support for RIP-7212 would decrease the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve <a href=\"https://www.alchemy.com/blog/what-is-rip-7212\">by 99%</a> when compared to current implementations. This makes implementing passkey-based wallets feasible for everyday use. Many wallets, and notably, apps using embedded wallets, have been requesting this feature for over a year.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>This proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s mission and values as per the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values\">Constitution</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>Ethereum-Aligned</strong>: RIP-7212 is the first Rollup Improvement Proposal adopted by the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The RIP stakeholders coordinate with Ethereum Core Devs to ensure Ethereum will continue to be compatible with the upgrade.</p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Many users who are not crypto-native will refuse to write down a seed phrase or buy a dedicated hardware wallet.

And ideally, making this discovery simple and accessible for users.</p>\n<p>In a span of a couple months, there will be 100+ protocols that will distribute upwards of $60-80 million of ARB in incentives. Throughout the Arbitrum ecosystem, there will be an abundance of new engagement opportunities, but how do we ensure the right users can effectively discover what is happening?</p>\n<p>With STIP, little to no adjacent marketing or communication was administered to supplement the incentive rollout, let alone a central base for users to know where incentives are being offered and how to earn them. Compared to other ecosystems, this is a major gap in Arbitrum’s overall execution strategy and we believe there needs to be action taken to ensure successful engagement of the programs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"potential-solutions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#potential-solutions-2\"></a>Potential Solutions</h2>\n<p>At bare minimum, there needs to be some sort of incentive hub, a home base of sorts (ex. <a href=\"https://onchainsummer.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Base’s Onchain Summer</a>), for users to discover the protocols offering incentives.</p>\n<p>Some potential ideas on what this could look like:</p>\n<p><strong>A.

In return, the new Orbit chain is expected to share 10% of their chain’s profit back to the wider Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes 8% for the ArbitrumDAO and 2% for a new Arbitrum Developer Guild.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"support-chains-other-than-ethereum-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#support-chains-other-than-ethereum-1\"></a>Support chains other than Ethereum?</h1>\n<p>One restriction of the Arbitrum Expansion Program is that a new Orbit chain must be deployed on any chain that derives security from Ethereum.</p>\n<p>More specifically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The “<strong>Arbitrum Expansion Program</strong>” is a suite of tools and services maintained and provided by the Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Foundation Company (the “Foundation”) designed to enable you to deploy and operate a trust-minimized network that has its security depend on the security of the Ethereum blockchain, which by way of example, is intended to include optimistic rollups, zk-rollups, optimiums and validiums that settle to Ethereum (each, an “Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the past few weeks, the Arbitrum Foundation has received inbound interest from projects that want to deploy their own Orbit chain on other networks including, but not limited to: Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Cosmos, and others. We expect this type of interest to increase over time as the Arbitrum Tech Stack gains popularity on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>This leads to the following question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>S<strong>hould the Arbitrum Expansion Program be changed to allow Orbit chains to be deployed on blockchain networks other than Ethereum?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation is requesting the ArbitrumDAO to decide on whether the Arbitrum Expansion Program should further expand and allow new Orbit chains to be deployed on chains other than Ethereum (and its derivatives).</p>\n<p>There are a few points to consider when evaluating the above question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Revenue share</strong>. Allowing widespread deployment of Orbit could potentially increase the revenue generated for the ArbitrumDAO simply due to the increased number of deployments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>EVM dominance</strong>. It can be argued that the EVM and Solidity has become dominant across the industry as it was easily adoptable by blockchain projects including rollups like Arbitrum. Accordingly, allowing widespread deployment of Orbit can further bolster EVM and Stylus (EVM+) dominance across the industry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ethereum’s competitive advantage</strong>. Restricting Orbit chains to only Ethereum can potentially act as a competitive advantage for the Ethereum ecosystem, but there is a potential tragedy of the commons if the Arbitrum Tech Stack is only restricted to Ethereum while other rollups can be freely deployed elsewhere.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alleviate confusion on definitions</strong>. There are increasingly blurry lines on what it means to settle on a particular chain as projects adopt different data availability layers, host chains, and bridge configurations. It may even be possible for a single rollup to have multiple validating bridges across different blockchains. Changing the license can alleviate the need to resolve these blurry lines and allow projects greater certainty when deciding to deploy an Orbit chain.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, the above is not an exhaustive list, and there are other points the community may want to consider when making their decision.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"implementation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#implementation-2\"></a>Implementation</h1>\n<p>Assuming the ArbitrumDAO approves Orbit chains to be deployed on any chain, then the Arbiturm Foundation will be responsible for collecting the 10% chain profit revenue share on the new chain and eventually migrating the funds into the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury and the Arbitrum Developer Guild.</p>\n<p>The only requirement a project should consider before deploying on a chain is to check whether the Arbitrum Foundation has deployed a multisig to collect the revenue share. A multisig will be required to help the Arbitrum Foundation collect the fees and periodically bridge it to the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Arbitrum Expansion Program’s description will be updated with the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum Expansion Program</strong><br>\nThe “Arbitrum Expansion Program” is a suite of tools and services maintained and provided by The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company (the “Foundation”) designed to enable you to deploy and operate a trust-minimized scaling solution on a public blockchain network (each, an “Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation”). Subject to the terms of, and your compliance with, this Arbitrum Expansion Program Agreement (“Agreement”), the Foundation hereby agrees to make the Arbitrum Expansion Program available to you to develop and launch an Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation.

The examples here are not exhaustive, but should give you a sense of the definition. A quality grant program has:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A purpose</p>\n<p>Ex 1 - To fund entrepreneurs building on Arbitrum in a specific geography<br>\nEx 2 - To learn best practices for funding specific critical functions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A success metric (or multiple)</p>\n<p>Ex 1 - Leading Indicators - Number of grants sourced, accepted, and validated<br>\nEx 2 - North Star Metrics - Transactions generated, new wallets, TVL growth, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A funding mechanism (or multiple)</p>\n<p>Ex 1 - Quadratic funding, delegated domain authority, conviction voting<br>\nEx 2 - Retro vs Proactive, how eligibility criteria are enforced, sybil defense</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A program manager</p>\n<p>Ex 1 - A community leader matched with a grant program idea<br>\nEx 2 - A founder recommended driver of a novel on-chain granting mechanism</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"experimenting-with-funding-mechanisms-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#experimenting-with-funding-mechanisms-1\"></a>Experimenting with Funding Mechanisms</h1>\n<p><em><strong>For continuing experimentation with novel funding mechanisms to better allocate funds based on the ecosystem function being funded.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Understanding the intricacies of various funding mechanisms is crucial to the success of any grant program. Our RFP process is designed to not only match programs with known funding models but also to explore and experiment with these mechanisms. This includes experimenting with different organizational structures, such as centralized and crowdsourced assessments, as well as comparing pre-planned evaluation processes with challenge bounties.</p>\n<p>This exploration will help us grasp which models best support different types of initiatives, ensuring that our future funding strategies are as effective and impactful as possible.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"seeking-a-diversity-of-perspectives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#seeking-a-diversity-of-perspectives-2\"></a>Seeking a Diversity of Perspectives</h1>\n<p><em>For matching strong community leaders around the world to proven funding mechanisms, coaching, runbooks, and support network.</em></p>\n<p>One of our primary objectives is to identify and engage program managers from a wide range of perspectives. These may include unique contextual perspectives, technical capabilities, and geographical regions. We believe that local insights and experiences are invaluable assets that can drive the success of grant programs. By matching these diverse talents with suitable funding mechanisms, we aim to cultivate a global network of innovators who can bring unique perspectives and solutions to the table.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"addressing-immediate-needs-of-the-arbitrum-dao-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#addressing-immediate-needs-of-the-arbitrum-dao-3\"></a>Addressing Immediate Needs of the Arbitrum DAO</h1>\n<p><em><strong>For immediately providing support to the current biggest needs of Arbitrum DAO.</strong></em></p>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO faces its unique set of challenges and opportunities. Part of our RFP process is dedicated to identifying grant programs that can address these immediate needs. By solving these pressing issues, we aim to demonstrate the power of community-driven innovation and the potential for rapid, effective change within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Examples of the types of needs that might be addressed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The onboarding working group needs funds to allocate to start a bounty board</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A group of delegates want a previously not provided data analysis about an ongoing incentive program</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A community member recognizes people contributing to the ecosystem that are not being fairly rewarded</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An orbit adoption education materials creation contest idea needs to be matched with a program manager and funds to become a reality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Funding:</strong> Approximately 3 million ARB available for distribution between 5-10 programs.

Follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thankarbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Twitter.com/ThankArbitrum</a> for updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Demonstrate scalability and impact in your proposal. Don’t just request the maximum amount but instead focus on how “1 dollar in can equal 2 dollars out”. This does not need to reflect transactions on chain but please do include details about network effects or other outcomes that will drive adoption, attract talented developers or in other ways increase the perceived value of Arbitrum and Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"faqs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#faqs-7\"></a>FAQs</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"how-much-money-should-i-request-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-much-money-should-i-request-8\"></a>How much money should I request?</h3>\n<p>In total <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-to-fund-plurality-labs-milestone-1b-ridge/21332\">we have approximately 3 million ARB to distribute in Thank ARB Milestone 1(b)</a> and we intend to select five to ten programs to facilitate that distribution. The intention behind your program should be to demonstrate how money spent on grants can result in real, measurable results.</p>\n<p>Think of how your program can demonstrate how for every one dollar put in, you can generate two dollars worth of value when considering how much to request. Keep in mind that the objective should be to demonstrate this kind of value and the potential for scalability.</p>\n<p>As a general guideline, we are unlikely to fund programs requesting more than 500k ARB including expenses for administration and development. Again, keep in mind that your core objective here should be to demonstrate scalable results where the outcomes are greater than the input.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-is-the-rollout-timeline-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-is-the-rollout-timeline-9\"></a>What is the rollout timeline?</h3>\n<p>The application process will close at the end of April. Decisions will be made mid May. Programs should plan to roll out between June and the end of August,. No later than early September at the latest if necessary.</p>\n<p>All approved programs will be added to a Telegram group to discuss coordination and rollout timelines.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"can-i-apply-for-more-than-one-program-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#can-i-apply-for-more-than-one-program-10\"></a>Can I apply for more than one program?</h3>\n<p>If you have ideas for more than one program, feel free to submit them. If you have ideas for programs that you think should exist but can’t run yourself, propose them, and we’ll do our best to find a suitable program manager. If your intention is to run more than one program yourself or with a team you will need to demonstrate the capacity and execution plan that ensures these program would meet the highest possible standards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-if-i-have-an-idea-for-a-program-but-i-cant-be-the-program-manager-myself-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-if-i-have-an-idea-for-a-program-but-i-cant-be-the-program-manager-myself-11\"></a>What if I have an idea for a program but I can’t be the program manager myself?</h3>\n<p>We encourage you to make suggestions here for programs you think would be a good fit for Arbitrum DAO. You don’t have to be the program director and we have <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appwXztAtdLkcBD3v/pagH8ECykJpizDIfW/form\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a separate process</a> for identifying ideal program directors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-will-you-assess-which-programs-to-support-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-will-you-assess-which-programs-to-support-12\"></a>How will you assess which programs to support?</h3>\n<p>We have developed a rubric for assessing proposals. The questions asked on the application form are basically a mirror image of the assessment criteria. This process will involve delegates and community members participating in the review and ranking of proposals.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more information about this process and how to get involved (and compensated) as a reviewer.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"can-a-program-have-multiple-stages-and-be-iterative-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#can-a-program-have-multiple-stages-and-be-iterative-13\"></a>Can a program have multiple stages and be iterative?</h3>\n<p>Yes!

It may often be the case that starting with a smaller first round of a program and then doing subsequent rounds within the allotted time may actually generate the best outcomes and results for the community.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for reading all the way to the end.

Only a very small portion of the fees in the form of 8500 $ARB (~$9,500) were to be distributed. (8500 ARB distributed as of April 17th)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The entire situation can be sumed up as an incentive structure that you could say trapped users into using the protocol in a way where Furucombo could later say was misuse.

After the campaign ended Furucombo never gave any user an opportuntity to discuss anything related to the campaign missunderstanding.

What I challenge is Furucombo deciding that they hold no fault in incentivizing ‘wash trading’ and then they are okay with taking those users funds without ever making any effort to seek an actual reasonable outcome. There  is no evidence of theft from users as Furucombo control all the rewards as well as the fees they took. Hsuang-Ting has even threatend to take all the funds it has taken from users and returning nothing.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a7a52719abea846ec0fa6b37d83221c10a12644e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nV3zGS0hGyyXV0Nlw06C1STCS2W.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a7a52719abea846ec0fa6b37d83221c10a12644e.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"nV3zGS0hGyyXV0Nlw06C1STCS2W\" width=\"690\" height=\"147\" data-dominant-color=\"404348\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>As stated below, the wallets are obvious and the high swapping didn’t occur until the last several days allowing any user to participate in rewards up until the last day.

In regards to the rewards program, I saw the updated post about including swaps in the program. I had done a few and then even shared in some tg groups about the furu program.</p>\n<p>My thought was furu is incentivizing swaps so if they are incentivizing it then it’s fair game. But in any case I waited until the last week to allow others to participate till the end of the campaign.</p>\n<p>After I heard the rewards were under review I re-read the campaign rules again (for a 3rd time) this is when I noticed for the first time that furu had a statement about to not abuse and that it would be reviewed. I had no idea that was stated. I don’t know if others were careful about their transactions but clearly looking at the dune analytics users would have been a lot more secretive about doing swaps if I or others were intentionally trying to hide and do something malicious.</p>\n<p>I can’t speak for everyone but I fully believed I wasn’t doing anything wrong and still at this point am a bit unsure of the problem. My ask would be if there is a problem to reimburse the fees taken from the transactions. I think that is a fair ask. I and I am guessing others simply saw any activity as a win win, furu gets some users, rewards, as well. I had no intentions on other users being negatively affected as you see the rewards stayed available until the very end of the epoch to allow anyone an opportunity for the program. This was an honest oversight that seemed acceptable since it was incentived. It was not intended to hurt the community, protocols, or users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1><a name=\"update-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#update-10\"></a>UPDATE</h1>\n<p>Before posting this I have tried to reach out again to Hsuan-Ting. I wanted to give him time to respond about 3 days but when I saw his status turn from ‘last seen recently’ to ‘last seen a long time ago’ inn one day, that indicates he has blocked me.

Should the total funding amount exceed the 45M budget, funding will be awarded in order of “For” votes until the budget is exhausted.</p>\n<p>After Friday, April 26th any request for funding Snapshots will no longer be coming from the LTIPP budget and will have to go through the entire Arbitrum DAO governance process to receive funding.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"future-incentives-programs-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#future-incentives-programs-2\"></a>Future Incentives Programs</h2>\n<p>In the LTIPP, we will fund at least 75 protocols and have learned a lot throughout the process. We experimented with how to structure the advisors and council, how to handle many different types of protocols, and how to handle such a large volume of applications.</p>\n<p>The LTIPP workstream consisting of the Advisors, Council, and PM will now use these experiences and learnings to begin turning our attention toward providing the DAO with recommendations for a full Long-term Term Incentives program or Perpetual Incentives Program that the DAO can run over a longer period with multiple funding cycles.</p>\n<p>We will improve the process using what we have learned and will have a new year-long program ready to be voted on by the time LTIPP funding ends in July. This program will be open to everyone and will immediately follow the conclusion of the LTIPP. We are announcing this now so the DAO is aware there are plans in place and can feel more comfortable that there will be future incentive funding available.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarified-process-for-non-council-recommended-applications-to-move-to-snapshot/23257\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarified-process-for-non-council-recommended-applications-to-move-to-snapshot/23257","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Apr 2024 17:35:18 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23257"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarified-process-for-non-council-recommended-applications-to-move-to-snapshot/23257.rss","#text":"Clarified Process for Non-Council Recommended Applications to Move to Snapshot"},"filter":false},{"title":"STIP Bridge FAQ","dc:creator":"Matt_StableLab","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h2><a name=\"important-resources-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#important-resources-1\"></a>Important Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdpAZAopmragWobcY3MdlROJN0hU3y_cAn0JOkdpsOE/edit?usp=sharing\">Addendum Template</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/stip-bridge-addendum/29\">STIP Bridge Forum Section</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/46550423530471344392834314743264512919726282073822921510880507756642229672784\">Full STIP Bridge Proposal</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"important-dates-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#important-dates-2\"></a>Important Dates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>First advisor office hours: April 19th at 4pm UTC</li>\n<li>Addendums can start being submitted: April 19th, 2024</li>\n<li>Deadline to finalize Addendums: May 3rd, 2024 at 11:59 PM UTC</li>\n<li>Start of Challenge Snapshots: May 11th, 2024 at 6:00 PM UTC</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"how-to-apply-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-to-apply-3\"></a>How to apply</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new forum thread in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/stip-bridge-addendum/29\">STIP Bridge section</a> of the forum</li>\n<li>Title thread [Protocol Name] STIP Addendum</li>\n<li>After creating an addendum thread, Applicants will be assigned an Advisor</li>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdpAZAopmragWobcY3MdlROJN0hU3y_cAn0JOkdpsOE/edit?usp=sharing\">Addendum Template</a> to apply</li>\n<li>Applicants will then have until May 3rd, 2024 at 11:59 PM EST to work with their advisor and finalize their addendum</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"who-can-apply-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#who-can-apply-4\"></a>Who Can Apply</h2>\n<p>The STIP bridge program is available for any project that was selected to be funded in either STIP or the backfund.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-to-meet-with-advisors-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-to-meet-with-advisors-5\"></a>How to meet with Advisors</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The advisors will be holding office hours Friday April 19th at 4pm UTC to help answer questions regarding the bridge. <a href=\"http://meet.google.com/aiq-cxmw-gya\">Call Link</a></li>\n<li>After creating an addendum thread to signal interest in the STIP bridge program, Applicants will be randomly assigned to an Advisor</li>\n<li>Each Applicant will have a new channel created in the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/nUe7QpYCB2\">Arbitrum LTIPP discord</a> where they will be able to chat with their advisor.</li>\n<li>All channels will be publicly visible but only applicants and their advisors will be able to type in an applicant’s designated channel</li>\n<li>Advisors will host office hours where protocols sign up for a time slot to ask advisors questions.</li>\n<li>If there is an issue with your advisor you may request a change and will be randomly assigned to one of the other two advisors</li>\n<li>Working with advisors is not mandatory: there is no council here to evaluate proposals, advisors are present to facilitate you in understanding your previous results and to help you change, if any, your application compared to the one from your previous STIP round</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"how-optimistic-voting-works-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-optimistic-voting-works-6\"></a>How Optimistic Voting Works</h2>\n<p>The Tally vote will optimistically approve funding for any protocol that posts a completed addendum.
