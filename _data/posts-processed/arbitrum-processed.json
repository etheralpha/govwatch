Additionally, by the time the last STIP report was released, we had successfully locked over $17 million worth of assets on Arbitrum through our initiatives, including PENDLE, GRAIL, RDNT, and WOM, aiding the sustained development of Arbitrum’s core platforms.</p>\n<p>Also, we learned the importance of incentivizing liquidity pairs for liquid wrappers to deepen liquidity and provide a reliable avenue for users to sell their positions while supporting the peg of the liquid wrapper tokens. This encourages user participation and supports the long-term development of top Arbitrum protocols by effectively decreasing the circulating supply of governance tokens.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-3\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7.

[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>We plan to continue leveraging incentives in alignment with our goals to boost user engagement and support the core functionalities of protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In addition to sustaining our commitments to lock up governance tokens from Pendle Finance, Radiant Capital, and Camelot DEX, we are adjusting our incentive strategies to include liquidity providers. Notably, MGP liquidity providers from Magpie will receive 100% of the ARB tokens allocated to Magpie through the STIP Addendum, while liquidity providers on Penpie, Radpie, and Campie will be able to share 40% of the incentives allocated to them respectively. This change reflects our decision to ensure more balanced and sustained liquidity across our supported platforms.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we are excited to introduce a new initiative with Eigenpie, a liquid restaking platform created by Magpie. The allocation of ARB to Eigenpie will focus on growing the TVL of LRTs on Arbitrum, reflecting a strategic expansion to leverage new products and deepen network functionalities. This adaptation showcases that we not only maintain but also enhance our support for the Arbitrum network and its participants. We consider LRTs to be an important category in DeFi, and we aim to help position Arbitrum as a hub for LRTs with Egienpie.</p>\n<p>STIP Addendum Allocations for the Magpie Ecosystem</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Penpie - 285,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>60% RUSH events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>40% LPs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Radpie - 100,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>60% RUSH events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>40% LPs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Campie - 100,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>60% RUSH events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>40% LPs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Magpie - 40,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>100% Incentivize MGP liquidity on Arbitrum</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Eigenpie - 100,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>100% Incentivize LRT LPs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10.

Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<p>The Magpie Ecosystem saw a significant increase in TVL, growing by more than 140% since the initiation of STIP fund distribution on Arbitrum. Our primary objective was to absorb the governance tokens of protocols we collaborate with, thereby enhancing yield and governance influence across various platforms, which led to increased advantages for users within the Magpie Ecosystem. This strategy moves beyond merely boosting TVL, which can attract temporary capital that targets STIP-related funds and departs once ARB incentives are no longer available. Our approach drives sustainable, long-term benefit for users, enabling them to gain more from the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem even beyond the STIP period. Despite receiving a smaller STIP grant compared to other platforms, the Magpie ecosystem has successfully increased participation, TVL, and activity within Arbitrum. We advocate for Arbitrum to consider this approach in the future as a proven strategy, as it not only contributes to TVL growth in the short-term but also supports the enduring value of the tokens from protoocls within the network.</p>\n<p>Through this initiative we effectively supported the long-term value of governance tokens from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pendle (2nd biggest protocol by TVL on Arbitrum at the moment)</li>\n<li>Camelot (7th biggest protocol by TVL on Arbitrum at the moment)</li>\n<li>Radiant (13th biggest protocol by TVL on Arbitrum at the moment)</li>\n<li>Wombat Exchange (Hyper-efficient stableswap)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Marketing Support: Arbitrum could utilize its prominent market presence to boost user awareness about the advantages offered through STIP/Grants programs. By actively promoting these programs, Arbitrum could greatly increase user engagement and enhance visibility of their benefits, which may result in more funds flowing into the network.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post -

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The addition of Backed Finance’s tokenized fixed income products to Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem will provide a low-risk, stable source of yield generation. Assets like the bIB01, bZPR1, bERNX, and bERNA offer consistent, predictable returns through their underlying exposure to government bonds and investment-grade corporate debt. This reliable yield can be reinvested into other parts of the Arbitrum ecosystem, supporting the growth and development of new protocols, applications, and services. By incorporating these tokenized fixed income products, Arbitrum can establish a sustainable source of funding for its broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

While the net assets of these ETFs are in the billions (€3.1B and $1.3B), the liquidity of the underlying corporate bond markets is substantially larger.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the SPDR® Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill UCITS ETF (ZPR1) and iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF (IB01), with $453M and $14.9B in net assets, are underpinned by the highly liquid and stable US Treasury market, which has a total market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion.</p>\n<p>Even the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (CSPX), a $82B equity ETF, benefits from the immense liquidity of the large-cap US stock market, with the S&amp;P 500 components regularly trading billions of shares daily.</p>\n<p>The large size and trading volumes of these underlying fixed income and equity markets ensure ample liquidity for the respective tokenized versions offered by Backed. This liquidity, combined with the stability of high-quality assets like government bonds and investment-grade corporates, provides a solid foundation for Backed Finance’s tokenized products, ensuring efficient pricing and reliable redemption processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Settlement times:</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of settlement times, Backed settlement times ranges from T+1 to T+3 (Business days) , we aim to settle fiat/stablecoin with clients on T+1 (current stats show that we settle T+1 80% of the time)</p>\n<p>This rapid settlement, with the majority occurring within 1 business day, allows Backed to deliver the fiat or stablecoin proceeds to investors in the bTokens in a timely manner. The short settlement window minimizes the exposure to market movements between the sale of the underlying assets and the repayment to investors.</p>\n<p><strong>12.

Can you explain how risk management (inv and operational) is being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Operational Risk Management:</strong></p>\n<p>Backed manages operational risks by maintaining  strict risk management policies that include detailed processes and continuous employee training.We limit access to sensitive operations, client’s information, and financial accounts to authorized personnel only… This said access is monitored and controlled through secure systems that require multiple approvals before any critical operation can be executed, ensuring additional safety and accountability.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of on-chain operations, Backed has partnered with a leading MPC provider and implemented multiple policy layers to ensure that at each step, only authorized personnel are able to make state changes and only after multiple signers given their approval for the action.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance and Reporting:</strong></p>\n<p>Backed ensures consistent compliance and operational integrity by conducting regular audits and reconciliations with our custodians and other third-party service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Security/Smart Contracts:</strong></p>\n<p>Backed places a strong emphasis on the security of our tokenization platform and smart contract integrity. To ensure the highest standards of safety, all of our smart contracts undergo rigorous audits conducted by reputable third-party security firms. These audits are designed to identify and rectify any vulnerabilities before the contracts are deployed, providing an extra layer of security. Additionally, we utilize a multi-signature approval process for all critical operations, which requires several trusted members of our team to approve any significant changes or transactions. This method greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and enhances the overall security of our operations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"performance-reporting-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#performance-reporting-7\"></a>Performance reporting</h2>\n<p><strong>1. What are your proposed performance benchmarks? If this is substantially different from the underlying assets, please explain why.</strong></p>\n<p>The performance benchmarks for Backed’s tokenized products will be directly aligned with the benchmarks used by the respective underlying ETFs or funds. As the tokenized versions are designed to track the performance of the physical products on a 1:1 basis, using the same benchmarks ensures consistency and transparency.</p>\n<p>For example, a tokenized ETF tracking a broad equity index like the S&amp;P 500 would use the S&amp;P 500 Index as its benchmark. Similarly, a tokenized fixed-income fund would benchmark against the appropriate bond index or yield curve.</p>\n<p>There is no need for substantially different benchmarks, as the goal is to provide investors with exposure to the same underlying assets and performance as the physical ETFs or funds. Using the industry-standard benchmarks allows for easy comparisons and evaluation of how well the tokenized products are tracking their respective underlying investments.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the content, format, preparation process, and cadence of performance reports. This should include proof of reserves, if appropriate. Please include a sample report.</strong></p>\n<p>The performance reports for Backed’s tokenized products will closely mirror the reporting provided by the respective issuers of the underlying ETFs or funds. Investors can refer to the regular performance reports published by the asset managers, which typically include details on net asset value, total returns, portfolio composition, and other key metrics.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Backed utilizes Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve solution to provide transparent and trust-minimized confirmation of the full collateralization of the tokens by the underlying assets.</p>\n<p>Proof of reserves <a href=\"https://por.backed.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a></p>\n<p><strong>3.

As described in greater detail in other sections of this application below, the fund covered by this application, SGD Delta Fund, is the first sub-fund of the Delta Master Trust, a master fund structure designed for launching funds tokenized using the Libeara platform.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>FundBridge Capital’s SGD Delta Fund (“SGDLTA” or the “Sub-Fund”), a sub-fund of the Delta Master Trust, is a fund whereby its units will be tokenized and issued via the Libeara platform. SGDLTA is the first investment grade-rated token in the Ethereum ecosystem, rated Aa-bf by Moody’s. As such, the tokens represent the introduction of a new primitive in the Arbitrum ecosystem: investment grade-rated assets.</p>\n<p>While there are a number of other tokenized fund units in the market, we believe ours is among the most secure due to the legal approach to structuring and the jurisdiction of issuance (Singapore). The fund units are tokenized and issued via the Libeara tokenization platform. Libeara is a new venture incubated and funded by Standard Chartered Bank, its parent. The SGDLTA fund is the first tokenized fund to be launched in collaboration with Libeara, whose roadmap also includes the tokenization of other fund units managed by leading fund managers and bonds issued by governments and corporates.</p>\n<p>We believe the Arbitrum community would benefit greatly from the introduction of an investment-grade primitive as well as the institutional presence of Libeara and its partners in the ecosystem. Furthermore, as an SGD-denominated investment linked to a portfolio of securities issued by the Government of Singapore, rated AAA by all three major credit rating agencies, SGDLTA offers currency and geopolitical risk diversification for the Arbitrum Treasury as it pursues its investment strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>SGDLTA is the first sub-fund of the Delta Master Trust, an open-ended, umbrella unit trust designed for launching funds where the fund units are tokenized and issued using the Libeara tokenization platform. A separate portfolio will be maintained for each sub-fund established under the Delta Master Trust, and each sub-fund will have its own investment objectives and risks.</p>\n<p>SGDLTA has been designed and structured in compliance with the existing financial regulations in Singapore, a leading legal and regulatory jurisdiction. The umbrella unit trust structure was specifically selected as the fund vehicle of choice for SGDLTA due to its many years of use by the industry for open-ended funds (including in the retail investor space) at scale off-chain.</p>\n<p>Each of the Manager, the Trustee and the Custodian are regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the “MAS”) as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Manager is regulated by the MAS as a holder of a Capital Markets Services Licence to conduct the regulated activity of fund management in Singapore.</li>\n<li>the Trustee is regulated by the MAS as a trust company licensed under the Trust Companies Act 2005 of Singapore and an approved trustee under Section 289 of the SFA.</li>\n<li>the Custodian is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a holder of a Capital Markets Services licence for, among others, dealing in securities and providing custodial services for securities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please also note that the Fiat On/Off-Ramp Provider, Xfers Pte.

Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Pursuant to the trust deed constituting the Delta Master Trust, each sub-fund of the Delta Master Trust constitutes a trust separate and distinct from other sub-funds of Delta Master Trust and the assets of each sub-fund are held on trust by the Trustee for the unitholders of the relevant sub-fund. Consequently, the assets of SGDLTA will be held on trust by the Trustee and will not be affected by the liquidation of the Trustee, the Manager, Libeara or the liabilities of other sub-funds of Delta Master Trust. In the event of the liquidation of the Trustee, the assets of SGDLTA will not form part of the Trustee’s own property and will not be included in the pool of assets to be distributed to the Trustee’s creditors.</p>\n<p>As indicated in our response to the immediately preceding question, SGDLTA has been designed and structured in compliance with the existing financial regulations in Singapore, a leading legal and regulatory jurisdiction. The umbrella unit trust structure was specifically selected as the fund vehicle of choice for SGDLTA due to its many years of use by the industry for open-ended funds (including in the retail investor space) at scale off-chain.</p>\n<p>Full details of SGDLTA are available in the supplementary documents provided with this application.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>Under the terms of the prime services agreement with the Custodian, the assets of SGDLTA are to be segregated from the Custodian’s own assets and reflected as being owned by the Trustee (in its capacity as trustee of SGDLTA). As such, the liquidation of the Custodian should not affect the assets of SGDLTA, which should be assessed by the liquidators to be held on trust for the Trustee (in its capacity as trustee of SGDLTA) and not be included in the pool of assets to be distributed to the Custodian’s creditors. The Custodian, as a regulated entity, is also required by applicable laws to adhere to regulations applicable to the handling of customer moneys and assets.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>Each sub-fund of the Delta Master Trust is constituted by a separate and distinct trust.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>FundBridge maintains a Risk Management Policy Manual and Risk Management Registers on a firm wide basis as well as risk registers for each fund that it manages. This risk management framework covers the risks criteria/tools, frequency of monitoring as well as mitigating controls for inherent risks such as financial, investments, operations as well as legal/regulatory risks. The risk management process and internal controls are audited on a periodic basis with the audit frequency depending on the level of risk.

Describe frequency of fee payment and its position vis-a-vis payment priority compared with other expenses (i.e., cash waterfall)</strong></p>\n<p>Fees and expenses are accrued and deducted on a daily basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract/Architecture</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. How many audits have you had and name of auditors? Please provide a copy of reports.</strong></p>\n<p>The Libeara platform has had one audit, performed by NCC Group in November 2023. Report provided privately in the supplemental documents submitted with this application. All findings in the report have been addressed.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Is the project permissioned? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Investors must complete KYC/AML and onboarding with the Fund Manager. Once onboarded, investors’ Ethereum wallet addresses are whitelisted in the Delta contracts, giving onboarded users full access to investment, transfer and redemption functionalities.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross-chain interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>SGDLTA is currently only available on Ethereum Mainnet. The Delta platform is also currently deployed on Arbitrum testnet, and we are actively working toward the launch of SGDLTA on Arbitrum One in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Support for cross-chain interactions is not part of the near-term roadmap.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>SGDLTA is not yet used in any protocols, though we expect it to be later this year. We view SGDLTA and the subsequent tokenized funds we issue as bridges between TradFi capital and DeFi functionality, especially given our relationship with Libeara, the tokenization platform provider, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>SGDLTA is designed and structured in compliance with existing financial regulations in Singapore, a leading legal and regulatory jurisdiction. The umbrella unit trust structure was specifically selected as the fund vehicle of choice for SGDLTA due to its many years of use by the industry for open-ended funds (including in the retail investor space) at scale off-chain.</p>\n<p>The Manager, Trustee, Securities Custodian and fund’s Bank are regulated firms in Singapore with fiduciary duties to SGDLTA investors. Furthermore, processes have been put in place to reconstitute token ownership and materialize tokenized fund units in the event of technical or operational necessity.</p>\n<p>Investors trust the Fund Manager and its delegated representative, the Fund Administrator, to mint tokens and process redemptions. Investors trust the fund’s Bank and Securities Custodian to secure the fund’s cash and securities.</p>\n<p>All Manager and Fund Administrator platform access is secured by 2FA. All platform access and actions are logged and subject to audit. All on-chain activities, including minting, burning and whitelisting, require Manager approval using Fireblocks MPC.</p>\n<p>Internal and external audits and reviews are performed regularly to ensure compliance with operational processes and regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<p>The SGDLTA token contract is built on top of the ERC-20 standard OpenZeppelin contract. The contract employs an on-chain whitelisting mechanism to restrict minting and transfers to wallet addresses owned by duly KYCed and onboarded investors in the fund. The contract also maintains a “clawback” function to recover tokens from lost or compromised wallets, requiring Fund Manager approval using Fireblocks MPC.</p>\n<p><strong>Supplementary</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

This is achieved by storing reserve assets entirely on-chain in an all-weather reserve, logically partitioned into different vaults. This has the effect of limiting contagion risk within the reserve in a number of failure scenarios.</p>\n<p>The reserve will comprise of the following crypto assets, in the following proportions, after the GYD bootstrapping pool (which provides a preset amount of GYD which can be minted against sDAI) is unwound:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>20% fUSDC (yield bearing USDC)</li>\n<li>12% aUSDT (yield bearing USDT)</li>\n<li>48% sDAI (yield bearing DAI)</li>\n<li>20% LP shares of a Gyroscope LUSD/crvUSD Rehype pool</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These vault weights achieve the following risk diversification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>38% exposure to centralized stablecoins</li>\n<li>43% exposure to decentralized stablecoins</li>\n<li>50% exposure to RWAs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yield sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protocol for Loanable Fund interest (aUSDT, fUSDC, rehypothecated LP shares)</li>\n<li>Yield from swap fees</li>\n<li>RWA yield</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These weights and exposures are expected to evolve through time as the Gyroscope DAO votes on changes to the reserve. This process is designed with a multitude of safeguards in place (see governance documentation).</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum/Maximum transaction size</strong><br>\nThere is no minimum or maximum.</p>\n<p><strong>Current AUM for product</strong><br>\n2.5m USD (as of 30 April 2024)</p>\n<p><strong>Current AUM for issuer</strong><br>\n23.9m USD across all pools (as of 30 April 2024)</p>\n<p><strong>Volume of transactions LTM</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1bn USD through all ECLPs (as of 30 April 2024)</li>\n<li>87m USD through GYD pools</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Source of first-loss capital</strong><br>\nGYD holders (if portion of yield retained by reserve insufficient and GYD Recovery Module depleted. The Recovery Module is due to be deployed and scaled in coming months).</p>\n<p><strong>Basics and background</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong><br>\nThere are two main stated aims of the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Short and medium term, to diversify Treasury held ARB into assets that are stable in value, liquid, and will provide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called “risk free rate of return” of US Treasuries (hereby called ‘stable RWAs’); and</li>\n<li>To function as a trial run, both in terms of the smooth functioning of the legal and infrastructural piping as well as to provide a proof of concept that Arbitrum Treasury diversification can simultaneously support ecosystem growth.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Gyroscope’s GYD stablecoin is uniquely positioned to enable the Treasury WG to achieve both of these objectives.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>GYD is stable in value. See <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gyroscope-gyd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. The stablecoin was designed from the bottom up to be as resilient as possible as a store of value. This means:\n<ol>\n<li>A widely diversified all-weather reserve (as described above) with smart contract encoded safety checks to keep the vaults comprising the reserve within defined bounds;</li>\n<li>Smart contract encoded minting/redemption pricing which seeks to promote long-term stability, autonomously balancing the goal of maintaining a tight peg with the goal of long-term GYD stability in the face of short-term crises;</li>\n<li>A new on-chain oracle system, the Consolidated Price Feed, which minimizes trust on single oracle systems such as Chainlink and improves fault tolerance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>GYD is liquid. GYD is perhaps the most liquid stablecoin for its size, able to do more volume per day than its total circulating supply while remaining on peg. GYD also leverages Gyroscope E-CLP pools that are the most capital efficient in DeFi. Further, GYD is directly redeemable through a primary market.</li>\n<li>RWAs are a core part of GYD as currently calibrated, providing yield uncorrelated to crypto markets. RWAs are to comprise around 50% of the GYD Reserve. The expected yield on the GYD reserve is 9-10%, significantly more than the risk free rate on US Treasury bonds while featuring a very great degree of risk diversification. It should be noted that as of the time of writing, the GYD Reserve is mostly contained in an sDAI/GYD bootstrapping pool. This bootstrapping pool is implemented at the protocol level and has provided an initial simplified way to acquire GYD by providing a pre-set amount of GYD that can be ‘minted’ against sDAI as a reserve asset by swapping through the pool. Ahead of receiving an allocating from the Arbitrum Treasury, these sDAI reserves from the bootstrapping pool would be partially unwound into the proposed wider Gyroscope reserve as outlined above, across the 4 vaults (fUSDC, aUSDT, sDAI and LP shares of a Gyroscope LUSD/crvUSD pool). Through time, other bootstrapping pools may be created including on other chains and L2s.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In relation to the long-term aims of Arbitrum’s Treasury diversification program, GYD is exceptionally well placed to showcase ecosystem growth. An ARB allocation could significantly boost the GYD stablecoin supply, with an allocation on the upper-end of the considered scale of 20m USD igniting growth for the GYD stablecoin on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>This would greatly serve to benefit both Arbitrum and Gyroscope long-term. Gyroscope is ideally placed to showcase such ecosystem growth, with an allocation of ARB under the STEP programme serving to supercharge growth alongside Gyroscope’s separate LTIPP and ecosystem grant.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong><br>\nGYD is entirely on-chain. Specifically considering the question of the risks relevant to transactional flows, the risks include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart contract risk: As with any smart contract system, there is an inherent risk that an exploit or bug puts committed assets at risk. This risk can be reduced by conducting code audits and testing, but it cannot be fully excluded.</li>\n<li>Risks of reserve assets: The Gyroscope system is backed by reserve assets, which may include other stablecoins, LP shares in AMM pools, and other tokens. Each of these assets has its own risks, and there is no guarantee that Gyroscope reserve assets always have enough value to fully back the system. More information on stablecoin risks is described, for example, in this paper. More information on LP risks is described in the CLP docs. While these asset risks have been studied (like in the provided links), cryptocurrencies remains a new space in which risks may not be fully understood yet. The Gyroscope reserve may in principle incorporate volatile assets, such as WETH, as future reserve assets. Should this happen, the system may be expected to become under-reserved at times due to the volatility of such assets. Stable assets also contain risks, and a depeg of such an asset could also cause Gyroscope to become under-reserved.</li>\n<li>Price oracle risks: The Gyroscope system relies on a system of price oracles to import asset pricing information from off-chain markets and to read pricing information from on-chain markets. At times, these oracles may provide wrong information or may be manipulated, which may lead to system losses on reserve assets. Oracle risks are described further, for example, in this paper and in the oracle system specification. While the Gyroscope design attempts to mitigate oracle risks, some residual risk always remains.</li>\n<li>Risks of using the DSM: The DSM defines the system’s monetary policy of how reserve assets are used toward maintaining a stablecoin peg. The DSM is designed to balance maintaining a peg with preserving reserve assets in the scenario that reserve assets experience shocks and the system becomes under-reserved. By the design of the DSM (and transparent on-chain), there is no guarantee that users are able to redeem GYD from the system at a value near the peg price at all times. In addition to drawdown risk due to volatility of reserve assets, the DSM may lead to additional drawdown of reserve value. The DSM monetary policy is designed to allow some level of redemptions near the stablecoin peg while the system is under-reserved, which would draw down the overall reserve ratio available for later redemption. This additional drawdown depends on the level of inflows and outflows that the system experiences while under-reserved and on the calibration of the DSM. The DSM is designed to be bounded by a DSM parameter, as described in the DSM technical paper.</li>\n<li>Bootstrapping pool risk: GYD is launched with a ‘bootstrapping pool’, which allows a pre-set amount of GYD to be minted in a simplified manner against a specific reserve asset. The bootstrapping pool structure bypasses the normal Gyroscope minting and redemption structure, including the extra minting and redemption safety checks and reserve diversification mechanisms. Should the single reserve asset held in the bootstrapping pool depeg, it would have an outsized effect on the Gyroscope system while the bootstrapping pool is large in comparison to the rest of the system.</li>\n<li>Upgradeability risk: Many contracts forming the GYD stablecoin system are upgradeable, meaning that the smart contract code may change over time. While it is intended that smart contract upgrades for GYD would fix any code bugs that may materialize, upgrades may also introduce new vulnerabilities and have their own smart contract risk.</li>\n<li>Blockchain infrastructure risk: The GYD stablecoin contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, and any interaction with the smart contracts inherits the risks of the Ethereum network.</li>\n<li>UI and blockchain interaction risks: When a user interacts with the Gyroscope system through the Gyroscope web UI, they are exposed to technical risks. While the Gyroscope UI has been carefully reviewed to avoid bugs and vulnerabilities, these cannot be completely excluded. A UI bug may lead to an incorrect transaction being generated, or the UI may become unavailable. A user’s own IT setups (e.g., web browser, wallet software) may further contain bugs and vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any of the above risks can lead to a partial or complete loss of the user’s assets.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps, OTC agreements?)</strong><br>\nNo</p>\n<p><strong>8. List all the third party counterparties linked to your assets including and not restricted to prime broker if any, custodian, reporting agent, banks for derivatives or loans and provide primary contact details for the third party counterparties</strong><br>\nN/A</p>\n<p><strong>9. Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong><br>\nThe central design aim of the Gyroscope protocol and stablecoin is to minimize and diversify risk to the greatest extent possible. At the center of GYD is a novel all-weather stablecoin design. It is designed to be fully backed by a basket of assets with fundamental innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level.</p>\n<p>GYD’s risk management innovations aim to segment and contain risks from across the asset space and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated risk diversification rules,</li>\n<li>Optimized minting and redemption bonding curves that guide the protocol on how to use reserve assets to maintain stability,</li>\n<li>A new resilient oracle and circuit breaker system that handles stress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GYD is designed to protect against the main risks of holding stablecoins, placing risk control at a high degree of automation in a decentralized, non-custodial way. It serves as a principled risk control layer for stablecoin holders. GYD, which aims to form the safest on-chain stable asset, implements these design principles.</p>\n<p>At the smart contract level, a number of safety checks are performed as part of every minting and redemption operation.

The Oracle system has a series of circuit breakers that are designed to protect the application protocol in case faulty oracle information makes it through the consolidation mechanism as well as providing protection against more general risks, such as mitigating the effects of smart contract bugs.\n<ul>\n<li>Flash Crash circuit breaker. If oracle prices as reported by Chainlink change by more than a threshold in a given amount of time, then the flash crash circuit breaker initiates safety mode in the protocol.</li>\n<li>Excessive flow rate circuit breaker.  Other circuit breakers initiate a safety mode, which is a pause of protocol operations over a set time period. It is designed as a last resort to protect against oracle exploits as well as smart contract bugs and unknown exploits. It operates by measuring ultra-short term flows within the protocol and triggering safety mode if they would exceed thresholds. Atomic exploits are also limited by adding a respective threshold amount.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Dynamic Stability Mechanism (DSM) can be paused. The DSM is an automated market maker that defines minting and redemption of stablecoins against reserve assets. The circuit breaker parameters can be calibrated by taking into account the manipulation costs of the price checks in the consolidation mechanism.</li>\n<li>Oracle guardian mechanism. A DAO-elected whitelist of oracle guardians can initiate safety mode for a defined period of time. The DAO is able to replace the list of guardians at any time. This mechanism is designed as an emergency response lever, which only has pause control, and is intended to be activated in the event of an oracle failure or if a smart contract bug is found.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Performance reporting</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

Describe any formal audit process and timing of such audits.</strong><br>\nIn an on-chain environment, anyone is able to audit the state of the GYD reserve in real time as all data is transparently and publicly available. One visualization of the GYD reserve is made available at app.gyro.finance and other dashboards are available.<br>\nSeparately, as detailed below, the protocol has undergone very extensive code audits.</p>\n<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Provide a copy of your standard contract, or one similar to what is being proposed here.</strong><br>\nN/A as this is a noncustodial solution.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Is the project permissioned? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong><br>\nTrue to the core value propositions of DeFi in general, the on-chain GYD is fundamentally permissionless. Any address is able to mint or redeem GYD through the smart contracts. In relation to the Oracle Guardians, a whitelist of addresses is able to pause minting (but not redemption) of the protocol. This is a security measure to allow minting to be paused if suspicious activity is detected.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross chain interactions?</strong><br>\nAt the time of writing, GYD has been bridged to Polygon zkEVM.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong><br>\nGYD’s largest use case today is as an asset in LP strategies, many of which are supported by Balancer and Aura. Several other protocols integrate GYD as a pairing asset for secondary market liquidity. This includes Aave GHO in collaboration with Tokenlogic and Karpatkey as well as upcoming integrations with Frax, Mimo paUSD, and PrimeDAO D2D.</p>\n<p>Further integrations in lending markets on Ethereum and Arbitrum are also underway.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong><br>\nGYD is to be governed entirely on-chain by the Gyroscope DAO. Various stakeholders in the Gyroscope community control the system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>holders of the Gyroscope protocol’s native governance token, GYFI;</li>\n<li>holders of the Gyroscope stablecoin who provide it as trading liquidity;</li>\n<li>Founding Members of the protocol, community members who have been involved since the beginning;</li>\n<li>Councillors, parties with expertise in DeFi protocol management;</li>\n<li>other DAOs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Votes can also be delegated.</p>\n<p>Participants in the governance system make proposals, which are discussed and voted on. Some changes need more voters (higher quorum) and of the voters, a higher proportion of agreement in order to pass. This is because some governance actions are low-risk and routine, such as deciding on the recipient of a community grant, while others are high-impact and may implement changes to the entire protocol.</p>\n<p>Proposed changes are subject to a timelock - a waiting period - before they are implemented. This is a protective measure to ensure that protocol participants have time to react to any changes they don’t agree with.</p>\n<p>Since the risk of code bugs cannot be fully mitigated, it is important that both the Gyroscope community and the development team at FTL Labs, who was mandated to deliver v1 of the protocol, are able to quickly address smart contract issues that may be found. For this reason, a centralized control multisig will temporarily retain control of the system parameters and protocol update and design decisions in parallel with decentralized governance. This multisig is led by the Gyroscope Foundation, a foundation company associated with Gyroscope governance.</p>\n<p>Following full decentralization, this centralized control vector will be removed, and further updates to Gyroscope contracts will have to be enacted by Gyroscope governance. This is fundamentally important to launching Gyroscope as a decentralized protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token?

Find details below:</p>\n<p><strong>We propose to pay DeDaub a total of 12k ARB</strong> for their assistance on crafting the requirements and helping whitelist the security service providers. We believe this is fair since:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each ADPC member gets compensated $8k worth of ARB per month;</li>\n<li>The technical and specialist nature of the work allowing for a higher rate;</li>\n<li>The difficulty we have had in sourcing Security SMEs who are not conflicted out, as mentioned above;</li>\n<li>The market rates for Security SMEs (we were quoted $500/hour by another SME).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As such, we believe a compensation of 12k ARB is fair for the value DeDaub will bring to the ADPC and to this process.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we also request an additional 10k ARB to the ADPC’s budget as an operational buffer to ensure that the ADPC can operate with speed and does not need to get the DAO’s approval for any small operational matters. Of course, this will be returned to the DAO’s treasury upon the completion of the ADPC’s tenure if it has not been utilized, and will not be spent on any internal salaries.</p>\n<p><strong>We will put up a Snapshot to get the ball rolling on this budget approval and reduce the likelihood of any delay in meeting timelines.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary Ask</strong>: 22k ARB in total (12k ARB compensation for DeDaub and 10k ARB operational buffer) to use from the ADPC’s buffer in the multi-sig.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> To confirm, DeDaub’s participation as the Security SME will preclude them from responding to the RFP and applying to be a whitelisted security service provider.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adding-a-security-sme-to-the-adpc/23526\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adding-a-security-sme-to-the-adpc/23526","pubDate":"Tue, 30 Apr 2024 14:58:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23526"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adding-a-security-sme-to-the-adpc/23526.rss","#text":"Adding a Security SME to the ADPC"},"filter":false},{"title":"Angle Protocol (stUSD & stEUR) STEP Application - STEP Application","dc:creator":"Mariam","category":"STEP Applications","description":"<h1><a name=\"applicant-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#applicant-information-1\"></a>Applicant information</h1>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> Angle Labs Inc. on behalf of Angle protocol</p>\n<p><strong>Address (Headquarters):</strong> Trinity Chambers PO Box</p>\n<p>**City, State, Postal Code:**4301 Road Town Tortola</p>\n<p><strong>Country:</strong> BVI</p>\n<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.angle.money/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.angle.money/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Primary contact</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Name:</strong> Mariam Kouanda</li>\n<li><strong>Title::</strong> Head of growth</li>\n<li><strong>Country:</strong> France</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Email, Telegram, Forum, &amp;

As explained in <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/savings/savings\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Angle documentation</a>, participants in Angle savings solution for a stablecoin are automatically allocated 90% of the yield earnings the protocol makes on the backing of this stablecoin, yet if less than 90% of the stablecoins are in the savings solution, then participants of the savings product may earn more than what they would be earning themselves if they were doing the same strategies as the one of the protocol.</p>\n<p>Savings yield therefore varies depending on the utilization rate of Angle savings solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the multiplier effect and the utilization rate?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>utilization rate of the Angle savings contract</strong>: The yield that the protocol distributes to stUSD holders comes from the backing of USDA. Currently, only 27% of the USDA is staked into stUSD, this means that the savings contract utilization rate is low and it allows stUSD holders to earn more.</li>\n<li><strong>earning more with Angle than if the DAO was just holding underlying RWAs</strong>: with Angle’s stUSD, users can earn more than what they would otherwise earn by holding the underlying assets/RWAs themselves</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why is the utilization rate low?</strong></p>\n<p>The current utilization rates on the stUSD and stEUR are low due to competing DeFi integrations that incentivize USDA and EURA holders to deposit their stablecoins in pools rather than staking them with Angle. For example, USDA supply is largely used on Aerodrome (Base Chain DEX) and Morpho rather than being staked.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/026704aa69008e40d9a6d504252ca0e80c51cfb5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lfFzhUsQPOPNiNRKBTOFMnV1nT.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/026704aa69008e40d9a6d504252ca0e80c51cfb5_2_690x382.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"lfFzhUsQPOPNiNRKBTOFMnV1nT\" width=\"690\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/026704aa69008e40d9a6d504252ca0e80c51cfb5_2_690x382.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/026704aa69008e40d9a6d504252ca0e80c51cfb5_2_1035x573.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/026704aa69008e40d9a6d504252ca0e80c51cfb5.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F3F2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Please note that both stUSD and stEUR are separate products linked to the USDA and EURA stablecoins.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></h2>\n<p>This investment will improve both the Arbitrum RWA ecosystem and the DAO’s holding in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eliminate acquisition costs of RWAs for all</strong>: investing in both, or either of stUSD and stEUR, gives the Arbitrum Foundation the ability to save on all acquisition costs and overhead related to investing in RWAs. Indeed, Angle Protocol directly supports the acquisition costs of the RWA with Backed Finance. Minting USDA and EURA to benefit from the yield provided by Backed Finance assets only costs the gas fees associated with the transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity, convertibility and no redemption time with USDC:</strong> Please note that USDA and EURA have deep liquidity with USDC and EURC from Circle, and it is possible at all times to mint USDA and EURA with USDC or EURC at zero (0) fees and also burn them for the same tokens for zero (0) fees two from the Angle Price Stability Module.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency: choose an audited, auditable and transparent solution</strong> with institutional grade transparency standards for its ecosystem with real-time analytics available,</li>\n<li><strong>Instant yield, no minimum, no lock-up: provide and get access to both RWAs and a USD yield-bearing stablecoin</strong> allowing instant yield, minimal fees, no lock-up and no minimum deposit,</li>\n<li><strong>Earn more: The Arbitrum Foundation will earn more and improve the return of assets of the DAO</strong> with stUSD compared to just holding bare RWAs thanks to Angle’s multiplier effect (see explanations on the “utilization rate” above).

While these are undergoing <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">regular audits</a>, there may be a fatal error or a vulnerability out there that would leave a portion or all the funds of the protocol to be hacked.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"blockchain-risk-37\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#blockchain-risk-37\"></a><strong>Blockchain Risk</strong></h3>\n<p>There is also an inherent risk with having smart contracts operating on blockchains which may not be bulletproof. Angle is deployed across multiple chains. If one of the underlying chains gets exploited, or if one of the bridge systems that the protocol leverages is manipulated, then the protocol could be left with a loss and get undercollateralized.</p>\n<p>The protocol has a <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/side-modules/cross-chain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">unique security system</a> to mitigate this risk and reduce the relative exposure to a bridge or blockchain hack.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"oracle-risk-38\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#oracle-risk-38\"></a><strong>Oracle Risk</strong></h3>\n<p>Angle is dependent on oracles (Chainlink, Redstone, Pyth among others) to assess the price of the assets it has in its reserves. The protocol has <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/transmuter/mintburn#%F0%9F%93%88-target-price-and-deviation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">important safeguards</a> in place. Failure of some of the oracles on which the protocol relies may lure the protocol into giving away its assets at a deflated value thus leaving the protocol under-collateralized.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"collateral-risk-39\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#collateral-risk-39\"></a><strong>Collateral Risk</strong></h3>\n<p>Angle stablecoins are backed by collateral assets. Within <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/transmuter/transmuter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the Transmuter</a> for instance, these should be denominated in the same currency as that of the stablecoin. For instance, EURA has in its reserves bC3M a tokenized representation of <a href=\"https://www.amundietf.fr/fr/professionnels/produits/fixed-income/amundi-etf-govies-06-months-euro-investment-grade-ucits-etf-dr/fr0010754200\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a Euro ETF</a>.</p>\n<p>Every collateral of a protocol’s stablecoin may pose some relative risk.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"counterparty-risk-40\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#counterparty-risk-40\"></a><strong>Counterparty Risk</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of the collateral assets of the protocol (EURC, USDC for instance relating to Circle or tokenized RWAs relating to Backed) are controlled by centralized entities. There is therefore a counterparty risk related to these entities. Bankruptcy remoteness and the ability to claim the underlying assets of the supported collaterals is an important aspect of the collateral selection process.</p>\n<p>As part of its <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/side-modules/amo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">direct deposit modules</a>, the protocol invests stablecoins and a portion of its treasury into other protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Morpho for instance).

As part of this system, Angle implements <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/resources/guides/bridge#bridge-limits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">total and hourly limits</a> to further reduce exposure to hacks.</li>\n<li><strong>internal security processes</strong>: the protocol has a “guardian” multisig on each chain on which it is deployed. This guardian multisig is made for time-sensitive situations where it may be necessary to update parameters, pause or unpause contracts functionalities. However please note that the guardian has limited ability to impact the protocol and cannot for example, modify references to an oracle contract and hence manipulate prices to its advantage. Major decision and minor decisions that have not been delegated to the guardian lie with the DAO. Note that it’s this guardian multisig that is responsible for updating the APYs for stEUR and stUSD onchain. The multisig cannot however increase the rate above a threshold defined by governance and decrease it below 0.</li>\n<li><strong>onchain decentralized governance:</strong> Centralization risks can exist within any system, even decentralized protocols. Angle is managed by <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/governance/angle-dao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a fully onchain governance system</a>, where ownership belongs to a Timelock contract with a 24h delay on each chain where the protocol is deployed. Governance attacks can be mitigated by an emergency multisig (4/6) which has the right to veto decisions that are obvious governance attacks. The Timelock contract ensures that even if “bad” policy decisions are taken by Angle DAO members, any stakeholder has the ability to leave the protocol before changes are actually enforced.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mitigating investment/counterparty/economic risks</strong></p>\n<p>The main following points mitigate investment risks with Angle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a design of the price stability module that centers automatic rebalancing of reserves and target weights in order to avoid exposure to certain assets that would exceed recommendations retained during risk assessments,</li>\n<li>an asset liability management committee with Steakhouse Financial that assesses the risk faced by the DAO and helps Angle governance optimize its balance sheet under hard solvency and liquidity constraints. This committee is what’s behind the recommendation and strict measure of always keeping at least 30% of the backing in liquid assets that can be redeemed/liquidated at T+0.

Boost plans to evolve it’s previous grant by introducing three improvements to it’s previous STIP grant: 1) A more aggressive and active sybil-deterrence strategy using Farcaster as a gated distribution channel, 2) an emphasis on sybil-resistant use cases, and 3) explore third-party incentive managers.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-1-farcaster-growth-opportunity-sybil-deterrence-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-1-farcaster-growth-opportunity-sybil-deterrence-3\"></a>1. Farcaster Growth Opportunity &amp; Sybil Deterrence</h4>\n<p>Farcaster presents an exciting growth opportunity for the Arbitrum ecosystem, as a significant portion of its user base is currently on Optimism and not yet active on Arbitrum. Boost will leverage Farcaster as a sybil-resistance layer, leveraging the fact that participating requires paying for <a href=\"https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/contracts/reference/id-gateway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Farcaster’s FID storage cost</a>. Lastly, Farcaster expands Boost distribution beyond Boost Studios hosted frontends (Boost Inbox, RabbitHole) to include Farcaster via “frames”. Some new advantages of this Farcaster approach are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It enables a targeted “conquest campaign” to attract Optimism’s Farcaster users to bridge over and engage with Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Frames with incentivized calls-to-action like bridging assets or trying Arbitrum apps can drive meaningful user flows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Farcaster user acquisition initiative will run in parallel to broader sybil deterrence efforts like whitelisting/excluding addresses based on sybil probability scoring. Combining a sybil-resistant channel like Farcaster with aggressive mitigation tactics allows Boost to drive an influx of authentic new users at scale.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-objective-and-use-case-based-campaigns-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-objective-and-use-case-based-campaigns-4\"></a>2.

Basics and background</h2>\n<p>Before answering the question, here is a brief of DigiFT:</p>\n<p>DigiFT is the <strong>first regulated on-chain exchange</strong>, approved as a Recognized Market Operator with a Capital Markets Services license by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) since December 2023. DigiFT allows asset owners to issue blockchain-based security tokens and investors can trade with continuous liquidity via an Automated Market Maker (AMM).</p>\n<p>At the moment, DigiFT’s smart contracts are <strong>on Ethereum and Arbitrum</strong>, and we are seeking partnership with leading Layer 2 ecosystem to better leverage efficiency of the underlying technology.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-how-will-this-investment-improve-arbitrums-rwa-ecosystem-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-1-how-will-this-investment-improve-arbitrums-rwa-ecosystem-5\"></a>1. How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</h3>\n<p><strong>Asset diversification:</strong>  This is straightforward, cryptocurrencies are too volatile for treasury management which target stable and safe yields. As a regulated security token exchange, DigiFT is able to bring traditional capital markets onchain and let Arbitrum ecosystem get access to diversified high quality assets that are uncorrelated with cryptocurrencies, and meet various demand of traditional assets from the Arbitrum communities.</p>\n<p><strong>Institutional adoption:</strong> As a regulated financial institution, DigiFT is in constant conversation with major financial institutions and regulators. DigiFT will be an advocate with regulators and financial institutions, to draw their awareness and increase their adoption of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Building a next-generation security token exchange on tier-one layer 2:</strong>  This is our mission. We want to leverage Ethereum and Arbitrum’s security to build the next generation of capital markets with higher efficiency, more transparency, and less middle-layer cost. By deploying the DigiFT exchange on Arbitrum blockchain, Arbitrum communities can trade diversified capital market products directly on-chain with instant settlement.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-6\"></a>2.Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

Under the DR model, <strong>each token represents a depository receipt of the underlying asset.</strong> DigiFT’s DR tokens effectively represent the assets held by the custodian on behalf of the token holders. DigiFT’s DR tokens represent direct beneficial interest to the underlying assets, allowing investors to directly enjoy the economic benefits generated by the underlying assets. These tokenized securities possess the same financial characteristics as the underlying securities.</p>\n<p>The DR model designed by DigiFT introduces a wider range of assets onto the blockchain, thereby bringing higher settlement efficiency and transaction transparency.

Centrifuge has since been developing the ecosystem and demand for RWAs on Arbitrum, starting with a webinar with Offchain Labs co-founder Steven Goldfeder in November sharing the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/events/7125924551783297024/comments/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vision for bringing RWAs to Arbitrum</a>. Centrifuge is fully operational on Arbitrum and ready to accept investments from day one. Centrifuge is multi-chain by design, all of the liquidity and TVL will stay on Arbitrum.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"decentralization-is-our-dna-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#decentralization-is-our-dna-7\"></a>Decentralization Is Our DNA</h4>\n<p>Centrifuge itself is a fully decentralized DAO, and comes with an active ecosystem and contributors. A partnership in this capacity would further the network effects of our relationship by connecting both ecosystems. The Centrifuge ecosystem consists of issuers and liquidity providers, which the Arbitrum ecosystem can onboard at any time.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"tvl-on-the-most-trusted-rwa-protocol-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tvl-on-the-most-trusted-rwa-protocol-8\"></a>TVL On The Most Trusted RWA Protocol</h4>\n<p>An investment through Centrifuge’s platform will bolster RWAs on Arbitrum by bootstrapping network liquidity for one of the largest RWA protocols onchain. The Stable Treasury Endowment Program was set up not only to improve treasury health, but to strengthen projects built on Arbitrum. Using Centrifuge will grow RWA TVL on the Arbitrum network on the most well-recognized RWA protocol. Bootstrapping liquidity on Arbitrum would also further the case for building DeFi primitives composable with our permissioned tokens on the Arbitrum network itself.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"start-with-treasury-bills-expand-beyond-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#start-with-treasury-bills-expand-beyond-9\"></a>Start With Treasury Bills, Expand Beyond</h4>\n<p>Centrifuge is asset agnostic, meaning we do, and will continue to support diversified, high-quality RWA credit asset managers and issuers. As Arbitrum develops beyond phase-1 in the STEP program, Centrifuge will be able to play a key role as a one-stop solution for onchain credit. By onboarding Centrifuge, the path to other assets becomes a more seamless journey.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"introducing-anemoy-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introducing-anemoy-10\"></a>Introducing Anemoy</h4>\n<p>Anemoy is a web3 native asset manager built on Centrifuge. The Anemoy <a href=\"https://www.anemoy.io/funds/ltf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Liquid Treasury Fund</a> (LTF) is a regulated, fully onchain actively managed fund for direct access to &lt;6 month US Treasury Yield. The fund is approved and regulated by the BVI Financial Services Commission (BVI FSC). The fund <a href=\"https://app.centrifuge.io/pools/4139607887\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">TVL is $9.7M</a> and has committed allocations of an additional $10M from GnosisDAO and $20M from Frax.</p>\n<p>Centrifuge proposes that the The Stable Treasury Endowment Program starts with an allocation to Treasury bills through Anemoy. Anemoy is waiving all management fees (15bps annually) on the Arbitrum Network starting from when the Arbitrum Foundation subscribes to the fund, ending May 1st, 2025. This is a move to not only attract the Foundation, but also incentivize other players on the network as a whole. Additionally, all third-party service provider fees are waived until the AUM reaches 50M USDC (currently 9.7M USDC). This brings fees to zero initially, and very low thereafter.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><a name=\"identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-11\"></a>Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

Some relevant partners to Arbitrum include MakerDAO, BlockTower, Aave, Frax, and GnosisDAO. Centrifuge is happy to facilitate introductions between organizations as requested. Brief descriptions of our work below:</p>\n<p>MakerDAO:</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2022 we proposed alongside institutional lender, BlockTower, to launch a $220M securitization pool on Centrifuge. The underlying assets were made up of senior loan positions in invoice financing, trade finance, or other short term receivables. Today, BlockTower pools on Centrifuge have around $190M in assets. The BlockTower arrangement was the first time a credit fund’s operations had been brought onchain, requiring immense legal and operational work to bring to fruition. Much of our DAO protocol work since has taken learnings and structures from this arrangement to implement elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Centrifuge began working closely with MakerDAO in 2020 when our first real estate credit pool was <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ns-drop-mip6-application-new-silver-drop-real-estate-backed-loans/3477\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposed</a> with New Silver. Since then, New Silver has launched another pool with MakerDAO titled New Silver II, where they got a debt ceiling increase from $20M to $50M.</p>\n<p>Aave:</p>\n<p>The Centrifuge RWA Market on Aave was launched in 2021 marking the first institutional grade RWA lending market. This allowed users to deposit stablecoins in return for senior or junior tranches of credit directly within the Aave application. The Aave DAO recently has approved to onboard the Aave Treasury into Centrifuge Prime, to allocate an investment into the Anemoy US Treasury Bill fund.</p>\n<p>Celo:</p>\n<p>Celo is another network using Anemoy on the Centrifuge platform to better their long-term sustainability for their treasury. They invest in Anemoy’s LTF and have intentions to diversify into other assets including Flow Carbon’s offset pool. Centrifuge is live on Celo through Liquidity Pools, marking the first use case of our multi-chain product. TVL remains on the Celo network, akin to this proposal with Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>GnosisDAO:</p>\n<p>Some of our newest clients include GnosisDAO, who decided to allocate a portion of their treasury to Centrifuge Prime, mainly the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund. The <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0xa779ccda18ee2aeb56894e8b5baafd3d2568e99b0fea4a03dd246f548084a93c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GnosisDAO proposal</a> includes $10M being allocated. Karpatkey is the financial service provider for GnosisDAO who is now managing the day to day operations of all investments including in RWAs.</p>\n<p>Frax:</p>\n<p>Frax is another DAO that recently decided to onboard the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund. The Frax treasury will be bringing $20M to RWAs as outlined in this <a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-308-onboard-frax-to-centrifuge-prime/2775\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">recent proposal</a>. This is a strong step in the direction of working towards long term sustainability of the DAO in light of ongoing liabilities and ecosystem development.</p>\n<p>Web3 Foundation:</p>\n<p>The Web3 Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that supports Web3 teams and open-source projects through funding, advocacy, research and collaboration, recently <a href=\"https://centrifuge.mirror.xyz/RPd-sjMJLK9W2UYknAM09EJwguxHJci-dbc2msd27MU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">announced their investment</a> with Anemoy on the Centrifuge platform.

These assets, T-Bills, have readily available market prices meaning the NAV is easily calculated by our BVI licensed fund administrator, Trident Trust. A tracking error in this context is the divergence between the price behavior of the LTF tokens, and the underlying prices of portfolio assets. This is not applicable for LTF tokens as the relationship between NAV and token price is identical. LTF tokens do not trade on the secondary market, meaning the only prices come from primary issuance and redemption.

These efficiencies in reporting, operations, and programmability ultimately save money for the end investors through low fees charged by issuers on Centrifuge. On the asset management side, Centrifuge drives efficiencies in reporting allowing all the flow data to be aggregated and act as a single source of truth for back office purposes.</p>\n<p>Diversification:</p>\n<p>Onboarding with Centrifuge allows the Arbitrum Foundation to access a multitude of different asset classes once the program develops beyond stable yields. All investments made through the platform can be managed within the portfolio management features on our application. Centrifuge is committed to furthering adoption of a multitude of asset classes onchain for all Centrifuge clients.</p>\n<p>Below is a simple table representing further diversification opportunities:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Strategy</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Targeted Returns</th>\n<th>Liquidity Thresholds</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Liquidity</td>\n<td>Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds</td>\n<td>5-6%</td>\n<td>Daily</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Preservation</td>\n<td>Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc.</td>\n<td>6-8%</td>\n<td>3-6 months</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Acceleration</td>\n<td>Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets</td>\n<td>8-20%</td>\n<td>3-24mo</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Institutional Grade Token Utility:</p>\n<p>Centrifuge is bringing institutional grade utility to RWA tokens, not currently observable in the market. Current utility offerings around RWA tokens are insufficient for reputable institutions to interact with from a compliance perspective. We are actively working to integrate them into a few different use cases such as lending and other DeFi primitives. See our recent proposal <a href=\"https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/rfc-launch-an-rwa-lending-market/6346\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">on Centrifuge’s forum</a>. Centrifuge is setting up use cases to allow investors to 1) pledge RWA tokens as collateral to borrow at high LTVs, and 2) gain instant redemptions as lenders are able to buy the short-term liability when users request to redeem shares. This happens in an institutional grade, permissioned environment by all parties interacting with the contracts and the contracts themselves.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"the-anemoy-liquid-treasury-fund-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-anemoy-liquid-treasury-fund-24\"></a>The Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund</h4>\n<p>The Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund invests exclusively in U.S T-bills with a maximum maturity of 6-months, and focuses on maximizing interest rates and minimizing price and duration risks. The fund invests in ongoing rolling maturities, meaning as one Bill expires, the fund aims to buy a bill with a maturity six-months out. This ensures a diversified mix of Bills between 0-6 months. US T-Bills are held directly by the fund with our custodian, Pershing LLC, and AUM can be viewed onchain.

The assets held in the relevant US Treasury portfolio are exclusively owned by the shareholders that have purchased shares in the fund.

However, the system faced hurdles, particularly regarding the availability of ARB from vesting contracts. Rapid issuance of oARB tokens initially yielded high returns for early depositors, but challenges arose towards the end of the period. As more depositors opted for the non-ETH investment 40-week option, we encountered delays due to the need to taper emissions.</li>\n<li>This experience highlighted the importance of closely monitoring token availability and adjusting emissions to ensure a sustainable and consistent user experience. Additionally, while the requirement for increased ETH and ARB investment faced backlash from farmers accustomed to direct emissions, it was a critical aspect contributing to the success of our strategy. Mandating a vesting ARB and ETH investment commitment helped reduce the number of users taking advantage of the high emissions rate, allowing savvy users to achieve increased yield in a shorter timeframe.</li>\n<li>Overall, this experience provided valuable insights for future iterations that protect the ARB community, emphasizing the need for flexibility and adaptability in incentive programs.</li>\n<li>Going forward we will target a direct incentive approach with dynamic incentives based on where TVL is needed within our vault system.</li>\n<li>Without an oARB system and running two different types of emission schedules we can create a streamlined dune dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>375,000 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved decision making</strong> - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Retaining top performers</strong> - Some ideas and teams won’t produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher self awareness &amp; accountability</strong> - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowers individual contributors</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.</li>\n<li><strong>Removed intermediaries</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone’s compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible information usage</strong> - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source contribution data</strong> - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Self sovereign identity adoption</strong> - Individual contribution logs can be tied to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust based networks</strong> - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they’ve built and the common connections they share.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Read our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution verification and contribution logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/approaches/contribution-verification-approaches\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification approaches</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Experimentation in Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>Individual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants process or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to start building up their own reputation. Idea funding and contributor funding could both experiment with individual contribution logs.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Further investigation</strong></p>\n<p>These is an opportunity to create more tooling that could enable individual contributors to easily record and present their contribution efforts. Contribution logs could become increasingly useful and reliable for contributors to build their reputation in the ecosystem and for voters when making funding decisions.</p>\n<p>In the comings months the Web3 Association is going to look at what tooling already exists that could be used and then explore what new tools could be created to make it easier to record and present contribution efforts.

It’s crucial to highlight that the impact of our STIP is not about ephemeral incentives. Instead, we are strategically deploying funds directly into DAO treasuries to foster long-term, sustainable TVL on the Arbitrum network. Our approach is not centered on short-term fluctuations; rather, we’re committed to enhancing the long-term stability and scalability of TVL on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We aim to cultivate a sticky and lasting TVL within these DAO treasuries on Arbitrum, focusing on the strategic growth of the ecosystem. This will be achieved by strengthening the financial health and governance capabilities of the DAOs involved, as evidenced by monitored metrics such as TVL growth and participatory governance activities incentivized by Tally. We are excited to track these metrics over time</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, we are in close communication with STIP recipients Open Dollar and Pixel Vault, who are expected to augment their DAO treasuries with substantial TVL contributions shortly. We are currently gathering feedback regarding the timelines and specifics of these deployments, which we will include in our final STIP Bridge proposal. Thus far, here are some metrics on the 3 DAO recipients of our STIP: Open Dollar, Content Guild, and Pixel Vault:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TVL in DAOs on Arbitrum incentivized by Tally</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>10/23</th>\n<th>11/23</th>\n<th>12/23</th>\n<th>1/24</th>\n<th>2/24</th>\n<th>3/24</th>\n<th>4/24</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/opendollar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open Dollar</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>41.7k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/content-guild\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Content Guild</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>16.4k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xa1885BFfE760bcCa872D3C34c976Eb0350e3590c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pixel Vault</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>75k (still awaiting our STIP distribution via bridge to Arbitrum Nova)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li>Votes in DAOs on Arbitrum incentivized by Tally</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>10/23</th>\n<th>11/23</th>\n<th>12/23</th>\n<th>1/24</th>\n<th>2/24</th>\n<th>3/24</th>\n<th>4/24</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/opendollar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open Dollar</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/content-guild\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Content Guild</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xa1885BFfE760bcCa872D3C34c976Eb0350e3590c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pixel Vault</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ol start=\"5\">\n<li>[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?<br>\nWe found that it is very difficult to predict how many DAOs will launch on Arbitrum during a specific period of time. Launching on Tally is free and self-serve to launch on Tally, though, so DAO launches are not dependent on our dev capabilities. Publicly, <a href=\"https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-governance-upgrade/3354\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GMX has committed to launching</a> soon and we intend to incentivise their launch in the next STIP round. We are in talks with several other DAOs, whom we cannot name, some for NDA reasons and some because without a public commitment, we are not 100% confident they will launch within the STIP period. We are excited to distribute funds in this STIP round to all DAOs launching on Arbitrum that we see as valuable contributors to the long-term TVL on Arbitrum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?<br>\n200,000 ARB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

To to mitigate this to a certain extent, we shipped an “airdrop points shraing” system - as a part of which, lenders earn 50% of the points from EigenLayer points/ LRT points.

The token grabs the place of asset information, where it is securely stored in the server named token vault. Token Vault is the only place where the original information can be linked to its corresponding token thus protecting the sensitive information. Creating tokenized assets includes defining the token type, choosing the blockchain to issue the token, a third party to verify, and more. In Asset Tokenization Platform Development, assets can also be divided and stored in blockchain ensuring security, transparency, and immutability which helps the investors to buy a part of the asses without buying them outright. This process can democratize access to an asset, reduce transaction costs, and increase the liquidity in the market.<br>\nVisit&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://maticz.com/asset-tokenization-platform-development\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Asset Tokenization Platform Development Company</a><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/l6ussYKDLbueaeeY9ubEq1EFttj.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Asset Tokenization Platform development\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"Asset Tokenization Platform development\" data-base62-sha1=\"l6ussYKDLbueaeeY9ubEq1EFttj\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"5A626F\"></a></div><p></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-does-asset-tokenization-work/23461\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-does-asset-tokenization-work/23461","pubDate":"Sat, 27 Apr 2024 05:30:31 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23461"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-does-asset-tokenization-work/23461.rss","#text":"How Does Asset Tokenization Work?"},"filter":false},{"title":"Frax Finance STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"Frax.Finance","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h4><a name=\"information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\"></a>Information about STIP/STIP Backfund</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Can you provide a link to your previous STIP proposal (round 1 or backfund)? <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-final-stip-round-1/16579\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[Frax Finance] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How much, in the previous STIP proposal, did you request in ARB? 1,500,000 ARB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What date did you start the incentive program and what date did it end?

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The driving idea behind the Arbitrum STEP is to support the growing RWA ecosystem and diversify the Arbitrum treasury into tokenized RWAs that offer stable, liquid and uncorrelated yield. For this, Dinari is offering two possible investments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>USFR.d, a token based on the WisdomTree Floating Rate ETF (ticker USFR), a fund that invests in U.S. Floating Rate Notes. Even among the various available Dinari dShares, USFR.d offers a unique investment avenue that was purpose-built with price stability, liquidity and yield in mind.</li>\n<li>SPY.d, a token based on the SPDR S&amp;P500 ETF (ticker SPY), a fund that invests in S&amp;P 500 companies and tracks the S&amp;P500 index.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dinari dShares are a new type of decentralized security bringing tokenized access to the US stock market to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The public stock markets are perhaps the largest traditional RWA category in the world representing $50T USD of value in the US alone and over $110T USD globally. While these markets are large and efficient, traditional access to them, especially outside of the US, is still challenging.</p>\n<p>It is Dinari’s overarching goal to democratize access to the traditional stock market and bring these assets on-chain. Dinari issues 1:1 backed security tokens (“dShares”) in the form of a standard, transferable and yield-bearing ERC-20s. dShares are guaranteed to be 100%-backed at all times with our fully-automated and audited mint and burn process.</p>\n<p>Dinari has been an SEC-registered transfer agent since 2022 and issues dShares under SEC Regulation S to investors that undergo KYB/KYC.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem is small but fast growing and Dinari is proud and excited to be a part of it.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

He stepped back as CEO in 2021 as the company was preparing to IPO. He has been contemplating the ways in which we can globalize the stock exchange through the blockchain since 2016, working to formulate the idea with Balaji Srinivasan who was a friend building a biotech company next door to Freenome at the time. The establishment of the first version of RWAs (mainly stablecoins) and their high market cap makes Gabriel believe that this is finally the time that a global RWA exchange will take off. His previous dealings with regulators has proven valuable navigating the difficult regulatory challenges of Dinari.

On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari is currently in the process of setting up a bankruptcy remote vehicle. Dinari Vault Inc. will be an independent but wholly-owned subsidiary of Dinari Holdings Inc and protected from creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. This is a high-priority feature and we expect imminent completion in Q2 2024.</p>\n<p><strong>How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari uses Alpaca Securities LLC for underlying brokerage services and securities custodianship. Alpaca Securities LLC is a FINRA registered broker-dealer and member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”). In the case of a brokerage failure, SIPC arranges the transfer or fair-market liquidation of securities and provides up to $500,000 in additional securities protection. In addition to that, Alpaca Securities LLC has purchased additional insurance through the LLoyd’s of London known as Excess SIPC Coverage in the event SIPC limits are reached.

If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari issues over 40 different asset tokens representing a wide range of US securities from technology companies to commodities ETFs and beyond. USFR.d represents one of our most important asset classes and is the primary constituent of USD+, our yield-bearing stablecoin. It also acts as a “cash-sweep” investment for uninvested currency.</p>\n<p><strong>1.

Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari unfortunately cannot provide legal, financial, or tax advice. Our users and investors should consult their tax advisors for any tax considerations.</p>\n<p><strong>Dividends</strong></p>\n<p>Yield for all underlying stock are distributed as dividends which are then subsequently distributed by Dinari to token holders in one of two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Holders of dShares like USFR.d and SPY.d are issued dividends in the form of USDC to the holding wallet.</li>\n<li>Holders of wrapped dShares like USFR.dw and SPY.dw are issued dividends in the form of reinvestment in the dShare which are reified upon unwrapping.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: Wrapping of dShares from their SYMB.d to SYMB.dw is necessary for compatibility and composability with DeFi. Wrapped dShares are able to account for changes to the underlying stock such as stock splits/reverse splits and continue to provide yield even when staked or otherwise used in DeFi protocols. You are able to wrap and unwrap dShares at <a href=\"http://sbt.dinari.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sbt.dinari.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>USFR.d</strong><br>\nThe USFR.d token issuance and redemption price is determined by the underlying USFR ETF price on the stock market. This price is typically very stable at approximately $50 USD per share with very minor fluctuations loosely based on dividend timing. We anticipate that holders of USFR.d will primarily see dividend-based tax implications.</p>\n<p><strong>SPY.d</strong><br>\nThe SPY.d token issuance and redemption price is also determined by the underlying SPY ETF price on the stock market. The price tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index and can vary over time. Because it is an index composed of many companies from varied industries, the price tends to be more stable than other stocks or ETFs. SPY is the oldest and most liquid ETF in the world and is considered a stable growth ETF in many portfolios. We anticipate that holders of SPY.d will primarily see dividend and capital gains/losses tax implications.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>The issuance and redemption of dShare tokens is a fully-automated process. Redemption requests are made by sending dShare tokens to the Dinari order contract.</p>\n<p>If the US stock market is open, redemption requests will typically take seconds. If the US stock market is closed, redemption requests are queued and executed upon market open. Large redemption requests that exceed Dinari real-time operational liquidity will still be executed in seconds but the return of USDC funds may take up to T+2 business days (typically same-day if before wire cutoff). This is primarily due to the slowness of moving fiat USD through the traditional finance system.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari plans to comply with and exceed at all times the minimum net capital rule outlined by SEC Rule 15c3-1 for broker-dealers. Namely, Dinari will hold funds that exceed the greater of $250,000 or 6-2/3 percent of its aggregate indebtedness (basic method); or, Dinari will hold funds that exceed the greater of $250,000 or 2 percent of customer-related receivables (alternative method). In practice, the amount allocated for first-loss equity has far exceeded the minimum requirements set forth by SEC Rule 15c3-1 to date. First-loss equity would first be denominated by the equity holdings in the underlying position; any excess would be sourced by Dinari equity capital, as appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>USFR.d</strong><br>\nThe underlying assets (USFR stock) is very stable with typical daily pricing aberrations of less than 0.02% and has an average daily trading volume of $190M. Typical transaction times for USFR for issuance or redemption is measured in seconds.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USFR:NYSEARCA?window=MAX\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1aa3393c8b13ba848a07f23aaf571effc78d2250.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"698C74\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USFR:NYSEARCA?window=MAX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Google Finance</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/359;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6396ae75dae0ab0f555434446a9eeee9cdb3c807_2_690x360.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEEEC\" width=\"690\" height=\"360\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USFR:NYSEARCA?window=MAX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund (USFR) Price &amp; News - Google Finance</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Get the latest WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund (USFR) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>The underlying asset of the WisdomTree Floating Rate ETF (“USFR”) itself are U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Notes which are generally regarded as one of the safest investment instruments in the world and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.

If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari dShare issuance and redemption flows are exclusively based on smart contracts and we rely on the transparency and programmability of the blockchain for all order flows. Blockchain derived risks can be split into a few categories.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Technical - Our smart contracts support a wide variety of assets and order modes and this naturally introduces technical complexity. We believe that we mitigate technical risks with internal code reviews, extensive automated test environments and external code audits.</li>\n<li>Operational - In addition to smart contracts, there are a number of internal processes that interact with our blockchain contracts to execute orders and move funds. To mitigate these risks, we employ Drata, an external consultant, to audit our corporate controls and processes and ensure adherence to AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. We are actively working on SOC 2 Type II compliance.</li>\n<li>Regulatory - The regulatory landscape around the blockchain is still evolving but our goal has always to be transparent and compliant. We have been a registered SEC transfer agent since 2022 and maintain active and direct relationships with both the SEC and FINRA.</li>\n<li>Error/Fraud - In the event of an error or detection of fraudulent activity, the dShare holdings of a wallet may become trade-restricted and/or blacklisted. At Dinari’s discretion and ability to accurately reconcile asset ownership with off-chain processes, dShare tokens are able to be reissued to return rightful ownership.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>7.

Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari manages risk along a number of different dimensions.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Investment:</strong><br>\nDinari issues tokens (dShares) that are backed 1:1 with an underlying equity security or ETF. We mitigate market and liquidity risk by only offering tokenized access whose underlying securities meet certain market capitalization and trading volume thresholds and trade on major stock exchanges, such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. In addition, none of our customers are currently using margin accounts or are able to borrow against their tokens. If we were to plan to offer customers the use of margin accounts in the future, Dinari would subject them to regulatory requirements, such as Federal Reserve Regulation T and FINRA Rule 4210, as well as to the margin requirements of our broker-dealer partner, Alpaca Securities.</p>\n<p>From a portfolio perspective, while the majority of assets under management relate to customer securities and funds held by Alpaca, Dinari does own a small amount of securities itself for the sole purpose of facilitating market-making and liquidity. Dinari actively monitors the amount of Dinari-owned securities to ensure that it does not exceed a certain threshold; historically, this figure has averaged less than two percent of Dinari’s equity capital.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Operational</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Customer: All users must undergo KYB/KYC processes with Dinari’s third-party partners, as well as pass AML/CTF procedures, before gaining approval to use the Dinari platform. Additionally, because Dinari solely controls the mint and burn process of our tokens, Dinari controls the redemption process of those tokens as well. Dinari also has the unilateral ability to restrict customer transaction activity on the Dinari platform should any user be found to be in violation of our policies.</li>\n<li>Internal Controls: Dinari employs Drata, an external consultant, to audit our corporate controls and processes and ensure adherence to AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. We also employ Fordefi, an institutional multi-party computation (MPC) wallet and security solution that is SOC 2 Type II-compliant and centralizes control over and access to our portfolio of crypto wallets.</li>\n<li>IT Security: In addition to internal controls, Dinari operates a centralized Identity and Access Management system using OAuth, SAML and multi-factor authentication to centrally manage access to all internal systems, production/staging environments and even most external systems. Dinari employs Drata to continuously audit and monitor access controls to proactively secure our systems and endpoints.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"performance-reporting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#performance-reporting-5\"></a>Performance reporting</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

The Thank ARB program has a bunch of reward for you related to Gitcoin Grants 20 (GG20)</strong></p>\n<p>Did you know that for the first time ever all of the core rounds run by <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gitcoin-grants-round-20-gg20-on-arbitrum/23156\">Gitcoin will be on Arbitrum</a> and they also selected Arbitrum to be the canonical network for Allo  protocol V2? This means all of the grant rounds contracts, grant proposals that were created on grants stack are all now on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Also in their 20th quarterly grants program round all of the contributions from donors that and the matching fund payouts from Gitcoin will all take place on Arbitrum!</p>\n<p>This means approximately <strong>50,000 people using Arbitrum</strong> for their donations (many of them first-time community members) and about <strong>5 million onchain transitions</strong> during the round.</p>\n<p>There are over 1.5 million dollars in matching funds for grantees in these rounds and direct donations from community members are often half or more of that total, So we can anticipate over 2 million USD equivalent in transaction volume generated from this program in a little more than 2 weeks.</p>\n<p>We have done our part by allocating funds from the Thank ARB program Milestone 1(b). We are giving 100k to the Open Source Software Rounds and 100k to the Community rounds that were selected by Gitcoin to be part of GG20 and who are running their rounds on ARB.</p>\n<p>But that’s not all!</p>\n<p>To make the most of this momentous occasion we have organized a series of rewards for your contributions in GG20, which kicked off this week on Tuesday the 22nd. Whether you’re a builder, a promoter, a curator, or a program manager, there’s a way for you to get involved, showcase your talents, and earn rewards along the way.</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing experimentation and iteration on funding allocation mechanisms and grant program design (at least 90 assessments done by multiple expert reviewers of projects plus all 8 of the grans rounds supported)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Attracting new builder and new community members (30k-50k users, at least 30 projects assessed as high quality which were made by builders on Arbitrum)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>generating transaction volume (approximately 5 million onchain transactions)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>increasing awareness and adoption of Arbitrum Nova infrastructure. (harder to measure but its a good intention to have)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strategy:</p>\n<p>This process is being “supercharged” by Thrive Protocol which we are using to facilitate these incentives as well as assessments and validation of the projects funded as well as the program themselves.</p>\n<p>The intention of this approach is to create a flywheel effect where one dollar in equals more than 2 dollars out in value (based on the goals stated above). In practical terms that means strategic rewards to incentivize useful activity as well as a mixture of automated and human assessment and human validation. This is the key to scalability and effective iteration/ refinement.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ha3zD7rrngTE3yjwjKDtk2Gjv2G.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Thriving_GG20_flywheel\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a_2_690x387.jpeg\" alt=\"Thriving_GG20_flywheel\" data-base62-sha1=\"ha3zD7rrngTE3yjwjKDtk2Gjv2G\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a_2_690x387.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"323231\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>For Builders:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Apply for the Thank ARB Builders Bonus: Don’t be shy about your amazing work!

start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>Our main takeaway is to carefully craft the incentive plan in order to create organic growth and foster sticky liquidity. One example would be support real-yield assets, such as LSD and stablecoins backed by RWA yields. By allocating more incentives to these assets, we aim to ensure that liquidity remains robust and resilient even after the conclusion of the campaign.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a><strong>New Plans for STIP Bridge</strong></h3>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>500,000 ARB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal? [Y/N]</strong></p>\n<p>The main idea is that the distribution framework will resemble that of the previous STIP, but with a greater allocation of incentives toward real-yield assets, such as LSD and interest-bearing stablecoins. We believe this approach will attract more users and liquidity in the long run.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>We will partner with other protocols to create additional LSD vaults and attract more users to Arbitrum.

What are the top level objectives and north star metrics our grant funding should drive? Most grant programs won’t directly affect these top level metrics, but how do we know that they are precisely targeting a goal which has leverage on the north star metrics? How do we define success of a grant program in a way that is aligned with the needs of the ecosystem overall?</p>\n<p>On Tuesday the 23rd, Thank ARB hosted a session to align on these goals.</p>\n<p>There are three phases to this project.

In the end, we came up with the following North Star Metrics (which we call Objectives) in no particular order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase Daily Active Users (DAU)</li>\n<li>Increase Total Volume Locked (TVL)</li>\n<li>Increase Net Bridge Inflows</li>\n<li>Increase Number of Verticals Arbtrum Leads in Market Share</li>\n<li>Increase Number of Protocols Actively Building on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Increase Number of People Buying ARB to Use in Governance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then brainstormed and heatmapped support for which levers have the best opportunity to affect these objectives. We called these goals.</p>\n<p>The top suggestions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kickstart new verticals</li>\n<li>Incentivize dapps for retention</li>\n<li>Attract new protocols willing to mint natively with lockups on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Design and implement staking &amp; utility use cases for ARB</li>\n<li>Convince RWAs to launch natively</li>\n<li>Market to institutional investors</li>\n<li>Targeted marketing campaigns to educate about orbit &amp; stylus</li>\n<li>Conduct token swaps with leading protocols</li>\n<li>Incentivize redelegation by tokenholders</li>\n<li>Highly targeted marketing</li>\n<li>Start a DAO DevRel team</li>\n<li>Provide DAO support services</li>\n<li>Gain unquestionable lead in defi, gaming, and RWAs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These goal suggestions were then broken down into strategies and measures. We relate this to a grant program in that most won’t be able to directly affect an objective like increasing the TVL. However, we can select them based on their alignment to ecosystem needs.</p>\n<p>If you’re thinking “Holy snozberries!!! Those North Star Metrics must have been drafted by some type of nincompoop”, don’t worry. This is only the first phase.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#next-steps-2\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>We will be launching a survey to key delegates &amp; contributors to suggest anything missing. During this time, we will use what we have to guide our grant program coaching efforts.</p>\n<p>The results of the survey will be used to create a Snapshot vote allowing the full DAO to participate in ranking the Goals.</p>\n<p>Then, each grant program will need to show which ecosystem goals they are directly aiming to impact. They will articulate the strategy being used and the measure of their success.</p>\n<p>In the end, we will end up with grant programs having legitimate measures to understand their success or failure. It is important that an experimental program can fail at the pilot stage, but the incentive is normally to claim everything as a success. This ratified alignment and process requirement to improve communication at all levels of the program will be critical.</p>\n<p>Here are some more pictures of our OGSMs which were started during the final breakout session.

Users with pre-existing positions in eligible pools will only start earning rewards if they originally deposited it via the Shell app. Otherwise they must first withdraw, and then re-deposit their liquidity via the Shell app.</p>\n<p>ARB rewards will be applied to all DeFi protocols connected to the Shell Protocol network and supported by the Shell super dapp. These rewards will be additive with any additional ARB rewards and protocol-specific incentives. Supported protocols will include (but won’t be limited to): Aave, Balancer, Curve, Pendle, Beefy, and Shell-native protocols such as the Proteus AMM. More pools and protocols may be added as integrations are built out.</p>\n<p>The Shell super dapp enables cross-chain zaps directly into any Arbitrum DeFi protocol. In order to incentivize users to bridge onto Arbitrum, a higher concentration of the total ARB incentives will be applied to rewards for Arbitrum-native protocols (i.e., with majority TVL on Arbitrum).</p>\n<p><strong>10.
