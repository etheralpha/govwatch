Specific amounts to each provider were mostly on the basis of existing AUM (the three tiers were below 100 million, above 100 million, and the topmost).</p>\n<p>We commend all applicants who applied under the program.We hope to make 1% treasury diversification via RWA ecosystem growth an annual occurrence so if you are disappointed at not making the list, do try again next year!

As many delegates indicated during the vote that RWA ecosystem growth is a priority of the STEP program, we threshed out a more equitable distribution.<br>\nFor future iterations, we suggest making the relative priority of objectives more clear. For example, if ecosystem growth is the most important, a single yes vote from any committee member should be enough for a provider to get included in an allocation instead of a majority. There could also be clear stipulations in future programs on how much extra allocation can go to existing providers versus new ones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While De-Fi support programs succeed through user or liquidity incentives, RWA providers care most about their AUM. We need some innovation for what ecosystem support in the RWA space can be that goes beyond AUM, such as subsidizing obtaining Moody ratings. We hope to see good work coming on this front from the recently approved <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/decentralized-review-process-summary-thank-arb-milestone-1b/24877\">RWA program</a> from Areta.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some additional considerations the committee considered for narrowing the list from 17 providers</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No investment restrictions</strong>, especially worrisome if a provider can use <strong>leverage</strong> and <strong>hedging</strong> at discretion of the manager. As one of the committee members expressed, we need something beyond common sense that stops a provider from taking our money and putting it into Argentinian peso bonds.</li>\n<li><strong>Segregated portfolio companies with multiple portfolios</strong> are an added risk. Bankruptcy remote is not just having separate bank accounts, creditors look at whether entities are in actuality separate (their own board meeting minutes, payroll with staff, etc) so that the subsidiary entities do not get rolled into the parent one during proceedings.</li>\n<li>Products with a <strong>tiny AUM</strong>, <strong>exposure to a single ISIN</strong> or having <strong>fund managers without extensive prior experience</strong> or <strong>outsourced</strong> to third parties are riskier bets</li>\n<li>Providers using their <strong>own proprietary blockchain</strong> or solely that of a <strong>competitor</strong> were passed on in this round</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralized governance</strong> of underlying assets which require additional due diligence and/or have exposure to the Foundation for the same add an extra layer of unpredictability</li>\n<li><strong>Redemption</strong> procedures have a <strong>lag</strong> period measured in weeks or months or are limited to a <strong>single stablecoin</strong> that is not USDC, USDT or DAI or require a bank transfer</li>\n<li><strong>Insufficient documentation</strong> such as not providing a PPM, investment memo, counterparty for reverse repos, guidelines, restrictions, having annual audits only or from unknown auditors or managers</li>\n<li><strong>High fees</strong> that are uncompetitive in the current rates environment</li>\n<li>Appears unlikely unlikely to develop <strong>secondary market liquidity</strong> to underwrite against</li>\n<li><strong>Operationally burdensome</strong> and requires more active oversight than is desired since individual issuances mature without auto-roll</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>We will keep a comment period of ~10 days before moving for Snapshot approval of the recommendations on Monday 1st July.</p>\n<p>We shall host office hours on this <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/xuw-buwo-dww\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a> with members of the committee on Wednesday (28th June) at 330 pm UTC to address any questions.

ARB holders who stake and delegate their governance power to an active governance participant (either themselves or another entity) will receive surplus sequencer fees proportional to their share of total ARB staked.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has accumulated over <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/treasury\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$50M of ETH</a> in surplus fees from Arbitrum One and Nova. Meanwhile, only about 10% of the circulating supply of ARB (roughly $324 million of ARB) is actively used in governance (see “delegated tokens” on Tally’s <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">delegation page</a>). The number of unique voters participating in the DAO has been <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3829223/6440489\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">steadily declining</a> since DAO launch. As a result, it is becoming economically attractive to attack the DAO treasury. The upside of attacking the DAO treasury is increasing (more ETH in the treasury), while the cost of attacking the DAO is not increasing proportionally to defend against attacks. A more developed version of this dynamic exists in the ENS and Compound DAOs, both of which are actively fighting off governance attacks (ENS <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/10\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documented here</a>).</p>\n<p>ARB Staking can improve the Arbitrum DAO’s security by incentivizing ARB holders to be actively engaged in governance. Instead of accumulating ETH into an onchain treasury that inevitably becomes a honeypot for governance attacks, ETH is used to reward ARB token holders who are contributing to the long-term health of Arbitrum.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>This proposal contributes to Arbitrum <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Community Values</a> by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure. ARB staking addresses an emerging economic vulnerability in the Arbitrum DAO by perpetually incentivizing ARB token holders to engage in effective governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-and-steps-to-implement-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-and-steps-to-implement-5\"></a>Specifications and Steps to Implement</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"rewards-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rewards-6\"></a>Rewards</h3>\n<p>We propose that 50% of surplus sequencer fees be allocated to ARB stakers. The existing DAO treasury of ETH from surplus sequencer fees would be unchanged, only future fees would be affected.</p>\n<p>If we assume a 1:1 conversion of the current <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">delegated ARB</a> (~324M) to staked ARB and assume 12K ETH (roughly the historical annual rate) in annual <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/treasury\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">surplus fees</a> accumulated, then at an ARB price of $1 and an ETH price of $3800 this would equal to roughly a 7% annual reward rate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annual surplus fees in USD: 12,000 ETH * 50% * $3,800/ETH = $22,800,000</li>\n<li>Staked ARB in USD: 324,000,000 ARB * $1/ARB = $324,000,000</li>\n<li>Annual Reward Rate: $22,800,000 / $324,000,000 = 0.07 or 7%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect all of the variables involved in the reward rate to evolve significantly over time. In particular, we think it’s important to consider the following items because they may have a material impact on rewards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently, there is no direct incentive to delegate ARB tokens. ARB staking introduces a direct incentive to stake and delegate. As a result, it’s reasonable to assume that the amount of staked and delegated ARB will significantly increase over time.</li>\n<li>In conjunction with the recent EIP 4844 upgrade, Arbitrum recently dramatically <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-gas-fees-sequencer-revenue/24730\">underpriced its gas fee</a>. As a result, the amount of surplus ETH accumulating in the DAO treasury over time has decreased significantly. We believe this situation is temporary and is likely to be addressed by increasing the gas fee in the near future, but it’s worth noting that at this time the rate of surplus fee accumulation is significantly lower than the historical norm.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"arbitrum-staking-specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#arbitrum-staking-specification-7\"></a>Arbitrum staking specification</h3>\n<p>Our implementation of Arbitrum Staking builds on top of <a href=\"https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Unistaker</a>. In addition to customizing Unistaker for Arbitrum’s <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">governance architecture</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/fee-distribution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fee collection mechanism</a>, we add features designed to improve governance outcomes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We require that tokens be delegated to an active delegate.</li>\n<li>We direct 1% of surplus fees proportionally to delegates, with both fee streams going to the token holder if they are delegated to themselves and active.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We define an active delegate as a delegate with a Karma Score over 80. We use an oracle to represent Karma Score within the staking system. Receiving an accurate Karma score requires delegates to <a href=\"https://www.karmahq.xyz/dao/link/forum?dao=arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sign a message</a> and post it on the forum as a way to prove that the forum user is truly the owner of the delegation address. Karma Score is calculated according to the following formula:</p>\n<p>((100) * ((Forum Activity Score * 1) + (Off-chain Votes % * 3) + (On-chain Votes % * 5))) / (Sum of Weights times Max Score Setting * 1)</p>\n<p>Our staking implementation directs 1% of surplus fees to delegates to sustain the ongoing growth and development of Arbitrum, a large portion of which is driven by the DAO. In its current form, ARB staking is not meant to replace the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/delegate-incentives-program/30\">delegate incentives program</a>, but rather to complement it with a smaller source of incentives that are programmatically tied to ongoing network operations. In the future, we believe it could make sense to integrate the delegate incentives program with ARB staking so that, instead of getting delegate incentive funds from the ARB treasury, they come directly from DAO revenue.</p>\n<p>Tally will build ARB staking into our existing <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum DAO platform</a>, so that users can easily stake and delegate in one place.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"integration-with-future-arbitrum-staking-systems-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#integration-with-future-arbitrum-staking-systems-8\"></a>Integration with future Arbitrum staking systems</h3>\n<p>We anticipate that additional Arbitrum staking systems will be developed over time, perhaps to incentivize decentralized block production in BoLD or to create an efficient MEV market in Time Boost. We view multiple staking systems as complementary. Each system would ask the staker to do different work for Arbitrum, take different risks, and pay out different rewards. Having multiple systems lets ARB holders pick between different risk/reward payoffs and specialize in different types of work to secure the system.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"liquid-staked-arb-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquid-staked-arb-9\"></a>Liquid staked ARB</h3>\n<p>Tally is building a governance-compatible LST to enable staked positions to participate in governance while being liquid. By staking ARB on the Tally Protocol, users will receive a liquid staked ARB token that auto-compounds rewards, is restakeable, and is compatible with DeFi. Tally’s ARB LST automates the process of accessing rewards for token holders by automatically claiming staking rewards and redepositing them back into the staking contract. We plan to work closely with Arbitrum ecosystem DeFi protocols and restaking systems to enhance composability and utility of the Tally ARB LST. The ARB LST will be an exchange token, which means the staking rewards will accumulate by increasing the exchange rate of the token (rather than by increasing the account balance).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"estimated-timeline-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#estimated-timeline-10\"></a>Estimated Timeline</h2>\n<p>Post proposal on forum for feedback: June</p>\n<p>Post temp check proposal on Snapshot: July</p>\n<p>Begin smart contract development (if temp check passes): July</p>\n<p>Submit smart contracts for audit: August</p>\n<p>Submit onchain proposal on Tally including full ARB Staking implementation and retro funding: September</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overall-cost-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overall-cost-11\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p>This proposal will not be submitted onchain until ARB Staking is completed and audited.

We are looking to fund 15 projects, each of which can receive a one-off payment ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 ARB.</p>\n<p>The program is an excellent opportunity for those looking to bring their ideas to life quickly and efficiently, with financial support to boost their project’s impact. Our goal with this program is to spearhead the rapid proliferation of Abitrum’s tech, community, and governance throughout the Global South and establish Ambassador strongholds in the region.</p>\n<p>Goals of Quick grants:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Accessible funding for Global South builders building on top of Arbitrum</li>\n<li>The rapid expansion of Arbitrum contributors + governance delegates in the Global South The rapid expansion of educational content pertaining to Orbit + Stylus</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Expected use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimal bootstrapping for projects at the start of their journey (proactive funding).</li>\n<li>Retroactive funding by request or discretion to support individuals going above and beyond in the ecosystem. Some examples might be:\n<ul>\n<li>Community management + Ambassadorship</li>\n<li>Open-source code contributors</li>\n<li>Governance management</li>\n<li>Educational content</li>\n<li>One-off workshops</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pool size: 75,000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Application Process + Methodology</strong></p>\n<p>Oasis Quick Grants will be proactive funding for grantees.</p>\n<p>We will open up a Quick Grants portal on Charmverse and add in relevant RFPs for Global South consumer crypto. During the application period, we will conduct 1-2 education workshops on the Arbitrum ecosystem and help grantees understand how to structure their grant proposal for maximum success.</p>\n<p>We will give applicants 2 weeks to submit their proposals with a strict deadline for the first milestone set at 4-6 weeks from the initiation of each project. Weekly office hours will also be held within these two weeks for feedback and guidance.</p>\n<p>Applicants can draft a proposal on Charmverse via a proposal template. The relevant program manager will review their application and provide feedback/approval in 3-5 business days. This streamlined funding approach aims to enable swift project completion.</p>\n<p>(Importantly, participants will appreciate the ease of application as no KYC verification is required for this category for grants less than 2K USD; for grants greater than 2K USD, applicants will go through the Arbitrum KYC process and then will be disbursed funds once approved. In regards to all approved applicants, THANK ARB committee will be disbursing the funds.)</p>\n<p>Given that this is only a 2 month grant program, we will be conducting biweekly check ins and requiring biweekly updates from grantees on Charmverse during the grant process. This will be an automated reminder in TG and via email.</p>\n<p>By Aug 15, we will ensure Applicants submit their 1st milestone, and we will submit a formal report of findings and feedback to the THANK ARB committee for evaluation by Aug 25.</p>\n<p><strong>Team</strong><br>\nThe program will be managed by the 4 founding team members, who each have specialties on multiple fronts</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stefen Deleveaux - Partnerships and Outreach</li>\n<li>Marvelgirl.eth - Consumer Crypto Strategy and Grant Support</li>\n<li>Estefania Ochoa - Marketing and Ecosystem Development</li>\n<li>Amira Gariba - Operations and Process Optimization</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will, of course, be providing regular updates via the forum.<br>\nMany thanks to <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/decentralized-review-process-summary-thank-arb-milestone-1b/24877\">Thank Arb</a> for making this possible!</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/48c10194da76d0d25aa7acd633683c5609cfa61c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/anBThHeMJJoQOyi8oXkPDnQMA1K.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"photo_2024-06-13_16-12-30\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/48c10194da76d0d25aa7acd633683c5609cfa61c_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"photo_2024-06-13_16-12-30\" data-base62-sha1=\"anBThHeMJJoQOyi8oXkPDnQMA1K\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/48c10194da76d0d25aa7acd633683c5609cfa61c_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/48c10194da76d0d25aa7acd633683c5609cfa61c_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/48c10194da76d0d25aa7acd633683c5609cfa61c.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"99E6D2\"></a></div><p></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/oasis-onchain-quick-grants/25057\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/oasis-onchain-quick-grants/25057","pubDate":"Thu, 20 Jun 2024 08:41:08 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25057"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/oasis-onchain-quick-grants/25057.rss","#text":"Oasis Onchain Quick Grants"},"filter":false},{"title":"Griff Green - Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"Griff","category":"Governance","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/97a0d772a4a79402933f5e739ee8f3865ec97e5a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lDmHn78eedu3bNQ2wCQrjnUge38.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"griff nice pic square\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/97a0d772a4a79402933f5e739ee8f3865ec97e5a_2_250x250.jpeg\" alt=\"griff nice pic square\" data-base62-sha1=\"lDmHn78eedu3bNQ2wCQrjnUge38\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/97a0d772a4a79402933f5e739ee8f3865ec97e5a_2_250x250.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/97a0d772a4a79402933f5e739ee8f3865ec97e5a_2_375x375.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/97a0d772a4a79402933f5e739ee8f3865ec97e5a_2_500x500.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"67605B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"my-bio-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#my-bio-1\"></a>My Bio</h1>\n<p>I’ve been a contributing member of the Ethereum community since 2015 &amp; received a masters degree in digital currency in 2016.</p>\n<p>As community manager for <a href=\"http://Slock.it\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Slock.it</a> and TheDAO, I helped form the community around TheDAO and led every angle of the crisis response effort following TheDAO Hack.

In order to modify the information of a given project, a user must first authenticate their credentials by logging in with an EVM signer, in this case, on Arbitrum. A signer may only modify documents where they are assigned by the Program Manager. While write permissions are constrained to only specific signers, anyone may read project data through open read permissions: all data submitted is open to all. To begin, projects must first authenticate their permissions to submit their data.</p>\n<p><strong>Signing in with Arbitrum Credentials</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Renown</strong></em> is the identity &amp; authentication app within the Powerhouse decentralized operations toolkit. Upon login it generates a Decentralised Identifier (DID) based on your ethereum address and issues a credential on Ceramic. This credential acts as a session key in <em><strong>Connect</strong></em> (Figure 1). <em><strong>Renown</strong></em> allows a user to sign any document modification and get access to their permissioned documents. By using an Ethereum signer we are able to track and validate all data submissions.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f3b0e4d76f64ef72be7561db7e20551d0c5c27b9.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/yLN1aboa0q7BDyrF0WUQUhcLWaZ.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f3b0e4d76f64ef72be7561db7e20551d0c5c27b9_2_420x489.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"yLN1aboa0q7BDyrF0WUQUhcLWaZ\" width=\"420\" height=\"489\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f3b0e4d76f64ef72be7561db7e20551d0c5c27b9_2_420x489.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f3b0e4d76f64ef72be7561db7e20551d0c5c27b9_2_630x733.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f3b0e4d76f64ef72be7561db7e20551d0c5c27b9_2_840x978.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"A0A6B1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Logging in using an Arbitrum Signer with <em>Powerhouse <strong>Renown</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Reporting Grant Status</strong></p>\n<p>ArbGrants uses a multi-step reporting workflow built on <em>Powerhouse <strong>Connect</strong></em> to help facilitate transparency and accountability.

The user also reports on the contract they will use to distribute the ARB. The user labels the distribution mechanism (e.g. Airdrop or LP Incentives). The user then notes any meaningful changes from their original proposal or the previous biweekly period, as well as their expectations they have for this bi-weekly period. By noting changes, there user provides a historic record of changes, questions, or issues that may arise during the program.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a2c8dd44df5823633ba5186f8b6bd15bd0349dc6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ne3Hp1Oz9GPVPpZPDazuLqkrSRM.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a2c8dd44df5823633ba5186f8b6bd15bd0349dc6_2_445x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ne3Hp1Oz9GPVPpZPDazuLqkrSRM\" width=\"445\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a2c8dd44df5823633ba5186f8b6bd15bd0349dc6_2_445x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a2c8dd44df5823633ba5186f8b6bd15bd0349dc6_2_667x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a2c8dd44df5823633ba5186f8b6bd15bd0349dc6_2_890x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Entering planned incentive distribution at the beginning of a two week term</p>\n<p><em><strong>Step 2: Logging In Progress Weekly Distribution</strong></em></p>\n<p>During the incentive period, around one week in, users are expected to report their current status of ARB distribution.

This time/cost saving allows ecosystem builders to spend more time on building and less time on admin;</li>\n<li>Generates significant buying power for Arbitrum DAO if used as a mandatory procurement vehicle;</li>\n<li>Retains open market, competitive tension between service providers. Once the whitelisting process is complete, the ADPC plays no further role in selection of service providers for specific projects. The Buyer retains flexibility to choose the Seller best suited for their scope and budget;</li>\n<li>Establishes high levels of transparency in the procurement process; and</li>\n<li>Will benefit Sellers by creating a level playing field for both new entrants and established organisations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Framework is adaptable in nature. The strategy and model documents employed are based on well-established strategic procurement methodology that can be re-used in other procurement contexts. These templates are designed to be used by Arbitrum DAO to facilitate any other procurement in the technology sector. Software, hardware, professional services, Cloud Services, Game Development, AI, etc. can be procured through a framework established via the Application Process template, Head Terms and Work Order Terms, adjusted to suit the vertical being procured.</p>\n<p>Currently, the scope of “buyers” is limited to the cohort of grant recipients approved under the Subsidy Fund discussed <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958\">here</a>. However, this set can be extended to include other groups, each of which can have bespoke rules applied if necessary. This will allow other grant programs to take advantage of the current framework if approved by Arbitrum DAO, with suitable adjustments to the terms.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"application-process-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#application-process-3\"></a>Application Process</h3>\n<p>Applicants should apply via the Application Form below:</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://noteforms.com/forms/rfp-for-security-service-providers-4sy14p\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://noteforms.com/forms/rfp-for-security-service-providers-4sy14p\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">noteforms.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    \n\n<h3><a href=\"https://noteforms.com/forms/rfp-for-security-service-providers-4sy14p\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RFP for Security Service Providers</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Please submit your entire document containing answers to the questions outlined in the Application Process Document (Part 2, Matters Containing Application R</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p><strong>Points to Note</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please fill in the following 4 fields (Name, Email, Point of Contact, Company Description) in the application form and submit your entire document containing answers to all of the questions outlined in the Application Process Document (Part 2, Matters Containing Application Response) in PDF format.</li>\n<li>If your document exceeds the 10MB maximum file size, please email us your response in PDF format to <em><strong><a href=\"mailto:arbitrumdaoprocurementcommittee@gmail.com\">arbitrumdaoprocurementcommittee@gmail.com</a></strong></em>.

Such higher level procurement frameworks are common in the public sector but have never been implemented in a Web3 context.</p>\n<p>The ADPC has already started developing improvements to this framework for its next term (should Arbitrum DAO agree to an extension). This includes an updated abstracted model to simplify procurements further and provide a completely modular approach that retains a single set of Head Terms and Work Order Terms with modular marketplaces added and removed over time as dictated by the needs of Arbitrum DAO. This future model will also expand on the use of code deference provisions tied directly to on-chain governance to permit the DAO to directly control the creation and wind-down of procurement frameworks.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the Framework has the potential to generate significant buying power and cost savings across Arbitrum DAO if used as part of a strategic sourcing initiative. In more advanced phases, this aggregated buying power can be offered to other Arbitrum DAO-aligned protocols and projects at a fee - income that can be returned to treasury and put toward other Arbitrum DAO initiatives.</p>\n<p>We will expand on these initiatives in future posts.</p>\n<p>[Edit 20-Jun-2024: Changed “Appendix A” to “Appendix 1”]</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031","pubDate":"Wed, 19 Jun 2024 12:22:18 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25031"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031.rss","#text":"Request for Proposal - The ADPC Security Services Panel and Procurement Framework"},"filter":false},{"title":"Start of STIP.B Streams and Timeline of Incentives","dc:creator":"Matt_StableLab","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<p>The 27 STIP.B protocols listed below have had their streams initiated by the multisig.

Milestone 2 will be a separate and subsequent proposal, created by the working group, that intends to create a more long-term solution. The decision to approach the subject in this manner was made on the working group call last week.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has experienced a significant decline in ETH revenue, primarily due to recent transaction fee parameter changes brought about in the <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x813a366e287a872ada13d4f8348e771c7aa2d8c3cb00b2be31539ceab5627513\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbOS Atlas upgrade</a>. From January to March 2024, the DAO spent an average of 13.8M ARB per month, primarily on protocol/user incentives. Additionally, the number of ARB funded programs continues to grow, which ultimately poses risks to the long-term value of ARB and subsequently, the DAO’s treasury. Meanwhile the DAO’s largest source of revenue—derived from the sequencer margin—has undergone a drastic reduction. This margin, a crucial component in achieving eventual DAO sustainability, has been impacted by reductions in L1 surplus fee and the minimum L2 base fee, as implemented in the ArbOS Atlas upgrade. Although these adjustments have reduced transaction costs on Arbitrum One, they have inadvertently flattened the ETH inflow into the DAO’s treasury, as detailed in our recently <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-gas-fees-sequencer-revenue/24730\">published research</a>. We highly recommend reading this post prior to diving into the rest of this proposal.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to optimize the DAO’s primary revenue mechanism to support the eventual long-term economic sustainability of the Arbitrum ecosystem without hindering protocol usage or growth. The DAO has missed out on substantial revenue since Atlas and this proposal looks to address that oversight. Implementation is particularly crucial during periods of aggressive user incentives, as these are times when the DAO misses out on material ETH revenue in return for the ARB it is spending.</p>\n<p>While the DAO envisions diversifying its revenue streams through initiatives like the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/53472400873981607449547539050199074000442490831067826984987297151333310022877\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GCP</a> and other capital allocation activities, licensing fees on the Arbitrum tech stack (<a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/Arbitrum%20Expansion%20Program%20Jan182024-4f08b0c2cb476a55dc153380fa3e64b0.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">expansion program</a>), putting a portion of the treasury to work in <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWAs</a> and other yield-bearing strategies, the critical reliance on ETH revenue through sequencer margins remains paramount today and for the foreseeable future. This revenue is crucial not only for maintaining current operations but also for funding essential innovations that ensure Arbitrum retains its competitive edge such as the ETH denominated costs associated with BoLD. <strong>Building DAO revenue streams is of the utmost importance in order to secure the future of the ARB token and DAO.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-5\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, our goal is for the DAO to evolve into a sustainable entity, with robust and adaptable revenue mechanisms ensuring long-term stability and growth. For this to occur, adaptability is necessary. Dynamic adjustments to the minimum base fee variable will allow the DAO to swiftly respond to market conditions and protocol needs, ensuring that we can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks as they arise. A flexible approach will enable us to maintain a steady source of ETH denominated revenue, thus enhancing the DAO’s treasury diversification, reducing dependence on ARB, and bolstering overall risk management.</p>\n<p>While the need for flexibility in fee adjustments is evident given the dynamic nature of demand for Arbitrum’s block space, properly designing such a system raises many open questions. Below are two potential paths for the DAO to consider as a part of Milestone 2, followed by a few open questions:</p>\n<p>Option 1: Create a multisig through Hats protocol or a similar mechanism that has the ability to change the min base fee within a certain threshold, such as between 0.01 gwei and 0.1 gwei. Each signer would also have a legal agreement with the foundation that they are expected to change the min base fee variable based on a DAO snapshot vote that reaches a certain quorum (100M ARB). This mechanism maximizes community involvement in changes to the variable and reduces friction to adapt swiftly. However, we are not sure that the DAO is the best suited to make this granular level of decision in the context of the optimal minimum base fee.</p>\n<p>Option 2: Implementing an RFP process to select service providers with optimistic control over the fee adjustments within certain thresholds. This mechanism provides a more responsive approach, leveraging decentralized governance tools like a Gnosis Safe, Hats protocol, and a X-day time lock with DAO oversight. This way, we can vote in the most suited entities to the role while minimizing their power. It is our suggested option that leads to many open questions. We dub this solution the Transaction Fee Mechanism Committee, or TFM Com.</p>\n<p>Open Questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In addition to regular reporting and term limits, what are other accountability methods to ensure selected service providers answer to the DAO?</li>\n<li>Negotiations and research will have to be conducted to determine a proper budget.</li>\n<li>Should selected providers be given powers over more aspects, such as target gas per block, in addition to just the L2 minimum base gas fee? This would also give the Transaction Fee Mechanism Committee (TFM Com) the ability to conduct valuable research into the economic parameters of Arbitrum and potentially change them in future (with DAO approval)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since it is a long-term strategic necessity for Arbitrum DAO to be adaptable amid constantly evolving market conditions, these questions should begin to be addressed by the already stood up working group. However given its current missed revenue and expenditure, there still remains an immediate need for the DAO to consider increasing the minimum base fee. This proposal seeks to address both of aforementioned problems in two milestones detailed further below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1</strong></p>\n<p>Milestone 1 will proceed to Snapshot in the coming week(s) and is a constitutional proposal to increase the minimum base fee to 0.03 or 0.05 gwei. This represents a straightforward approach and addresses the immediate missed revenue of the DAO. These numbers have been chosen as they all fall substantially below the 0.10 gwei L2 minimum base fee that the protocol implemented prior, and still allow Arbitrum to be one of the cheapest Ethereum L2s. It is clear from the analysis of the competitive landscape that in general real users are not fee sensitive at these thresholds.</p>\n<p>Milestone 1 is a swift change, addressing the immediate and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-gas-fees-sequencer-revenue/24730\">urgent revenue challenges</a> while we fine-tune the operational details of the TFM Com. For further motivation and reasoning around Milestone 1, again, please refer to our research post. This approach ensures we stop the ongoing loss of revenue as soon as possible. Concurrently, Milestone 2 will introduce a long-term solution, establishing a sustainable framework for the future. This dual-phased strategy underscores our commitment to both immediate improvements and enduring success.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2</strong></p>\n<p>As Milestone 1 is working its way through the Constitutional AIP process, working group discussions will begin for Milestone 2. The purpose of these discussions is to determine the TFM Com’s mechanisms, expectations, budget, and methods of accountability. Post working group discussions, we believe the first stage of Milestone 2 will be hosting an RFP process, in which we seek three quantitative mechanism design firms to sit on the TFM Com.</p>\n<p>Assuming the working group is aligned with our thought process, after the three service providers have been decided, they will each be added as a signer to a ⅔ SAFE multi-sig they will create. We will then utilize a role-based access control mechanism, such as <a href=\"https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">hats protocol,</a> to give this multisig the ability to alter the minimum base fee between 0.01 and 0.1 gwei, or some other agreed upon range that is approved by the DAO. Each change must be reported to the DAO X (tbd) days before being made and go through an X (tbd) day timelock. The multisig will be created with upgradeexecutor as a module, allowing the DAO to replace members at anytime through an onchain vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"potential-tfm-com-expectations-tbd-in-milestone-2-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#potential-tfm-com-expectations-tbd-in-milestone-2-7\"></a>Potential TFM Com Expectations (TBD in Milestone 2)</h2>\n<p>We envision the TFM Com being tasked with the strategic oversight and dynamic management of Arbitrum’s min base fee variable. The committee’s primary goal is to enhance the DAO’s revenue adaptability and sustainability, ensuring that the platform remains competitive and financially healthy. While many details are still to be determined by the working group, below is how we anticipate some of the responsibilities and accountability measures.</p>\n<p>Fee Adjustment Oversight:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor and analyze market conditions, user activity, and network demand to inform fee adjustments.</li>\n<li>Manage the minimum base fee within a predetermined range (initially set between 0.01 to 0.1 gwei) to optimize network usage without compromising the DAO’s revenue streams or network stability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Research and Reporting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct ongoing research into various components of the fee mechanism, including but not limited to the target gas per block and the impact of fee changes on user behavior and network health.</li>\n<li>Prepare and present regular reports to the DAO on current fee structures, proposed changes, and the impact of implemented adjustments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Community Engagement and Feedback:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actively engage with the community to gather feedback on transaction fee policies and their impact on the user experience.</li>\n<li>Facilitate discussions and workshops to educate the community about the fee mechanism and the rationale behind proposed changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accountability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The TFM Com will be held accountable to the DAO through regular updates and a robust audit process. Community feedback will be actively sought to assess the committee’s performance and alignment with the DAO’s long-term goals.</li>\n<li>The TFM Com will serve a predefined term length, but members can be replaced or the program terminated by the DAO through an onchain proposal at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-8\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<p>June 17 - Forum Post</p>\n<p>June 24 - Milestone 1 Snapshot Vote, ranked choice, with options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do Not Change Min Base Fee</li>\n<li>Min base 0.03</li>\n<li>Min base 0.05</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"july-1-proceed-to-tally-for-constitutional-vote-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#july-1-proceed-to-tally-for-constitutional-vote-9\"></a>July 1 - Proceed to Tally for constitutional vote</h4>\n<h2><a name=\"budget-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#budget-10\"></a>Budget</h2>\n<p>Milestone 1 is free to implement for the DAO and the proposal process will be facilitated by Entropy Advisors.</p>\n<p>Milestone 2 will require an additional DAO vote and a yet to be determined amount of funding, but these details fall outside of the scope of this initial proposal.

Through a $350,000 grant of gas and governance coins from People Powered, to the Arbitrum DAO with which it can use our future ‘Impact’ tooling with, as a collective DAO. (Disclosure: this will come at $0 cost to the DAO)</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong> – The blockchain space – as a whole – lacks a tangible way to engage with communities in crisis globally in a way that 1. Connects them directly to communities experiencing a crisis whether it be a manmade, or natural disaster and 2. Transparently provides though 3 different means, thousands of ways to assist while quantifying the impact made through assisting those communities, during a crisis.</p>\n<p>In truth the blockchain space, disaster response / emergency management space, and humanitarian spaces collectively lack an avenue to create direct-to-community impact around natural and manmade disasters in a truly decentralized, transparent manner with any mechanism that rewards and encourages open, inclusive, merit-based leadership from all stakeholders, involved in a crisis, or in the response to it.</p>\n<p>We aim to solve that not only for Arbitrum, but, for the blockchain space through the utilization of Arbitrum Orbit and Arbitrum Impact (the proposed 501c3), and we aim to solve this problem for all industries mentioned above through the People Powered Blockchain, People Powered’s Impact Network, and its nascent tooling currently in development (Referenced in some depth (here) at <a href=\"http://peoplepowered.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">peoplepowered.io</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> – Insert the backbone of People Powered, its L3 Orbit blockchain. A mere feature, paired with its ‘Impact Network’ and tooling which brings the blockchain and wider disaster response, emergency management and humanitarian spaces collectively together with members of a community in crisis to solve a glaring issue in a powerful decentralized manner.</p>\n<p>The issue being the traditionally exclusive, non-transparent and unscalable nature of traditional centralized responses to crises at large. That often times don’t empower the community itself to lead, and take action. And in a time when the climate is indeed shifting, what’s needed is something only true decentralization, championed by the wider blockchain community, can solve.</p>\n<p>Blockchains operating initially via Proof of Work like Ethereum – where a network of everyday people, provided compute in a decentralized manner to power the network – must adapt the ways in which it continues to champion decentralization (where it makes sense to) as compute becomes a centralized function of blockchain transaction processing or it risks becoming a mere payment processing technology as a sole use-case.</p>\n<p>People Powered – in the original sprit of blockchain technology – and in the spirit of Arbitrum’s mission of decentralization, will further advance practical decentralization (through the use of blockchain) well beyond it’s practicality as seen in uses such as DAO’s. We will do this while showcasing the overwhelming effectiveness of truly decentralized organizations as we’ve indeed already done through past iterations of People Powered that did not incorporate blockchain technology (reference some of the stories in the news section at <a href=\"http://peoplepowered.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">peoplepowered.io</a>).</p>\n<p>We seek to include the Arbitrum community through ‘Arbitrum Impact’ in our mission (aligned with the DAO’s) in the launch, and governance of a fund provided by us, and in the launch and governance of People Powered and the Impact Network and its tooling.</p>\n<p>The technological advancements stemming from my teams’ 20 years of experience in concepting, upstarting &amp; managing the largest decentralized community responses to some of the worst natural disasters in US history are only made sustainable and scalable through an Orbit L3, as a backbone. This proposal is our way of giving back, and empowering Arbitrum to do the same through our tooling and the proposed Arbitrum Impact fund provided by us.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Terms:</strong> 501c3 – A 501c3 is the legal term used to represent a US-based (non-political) non-profit entity or corporation.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong> – If approved, People Powered will create and register the ‘Arbitrum Impact’ 501c3 with an initial board of 3 people and set of initial boilerplate bylaws. People Powered will fund ‘Arbitrum Impact’ with $350,000 worth of our Purpose &amp; Impact coins.</p>\n<p><strong>Board and Bylaws –</strong> I will chair the board initially upon its creation and then in August we will open the process up to elections and I will step down so that the DAO can elect a proper board and chair selected by the Arbitrum community as a collective whole. The responsibility of the board will be a mere 2 things written into it’s bylaws:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To distribute – via multisig approval – the funds we’ve provided, and more specifically to distribute as DAO members see fit through our tooling (See Financial Impact &amp; Tooling at <a href=\"http://peoplepowered.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">peoplepowered.io</a>) when our tooling becomes available for public use (See “Timeline” below).</li>\n<li>To execute – via multisig approval – the collective wishes of the DAO in a single vote, as they relate to the Impact Network’s governance features. (See Governance at <a href=\"http://peoplepowered.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">peoplepowered.io</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The Creation of a Simple’ Arbitrum Impact’ Interface:</strong> The Arbitrum DAO will need to create an interface, or add to it’s existing interfaces via snapshot and the forums, ‘Arbitrum Impact’, as a feature giving all Arbitrum DAO members the ability to do the following 2 things with the funds we’ve provided, and when our tooling is available for public use:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ability to add (and vote on) proposals that advocate for the use (on a per-crisis basis) of the funds we’ve donated to the DAO. Such use of funds must be only through our tooling, currently in development (See “Timeline” below).</li>\n<li>The ability for the DAO and its members to propose (and vote on) proposals that they would like to submit through People Powered’s proposal system currently in development. The DAO will then be able to (through its Purpose &amp; Impact coin holdings, granted by us) have voting power within our governance system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Specifications &amp; Timeline</strong> –</p>\n<p><strong>6/13-6/30:</strong> We’d like to collect feedback from the wider community until June 30th 2024, and revise and add any further details based on community feedback to our proposal as needed. During this time we seek a delegate (to bring this proposal to a vote) who has strong ties to communities both within and outside of Arbitrum who are engaged in lines of work that create Impact.</p>\n<p><strong>6/30-7/30:</strong> We’ll look to you, the DAO community to rally support, and present potential board members for ‘Arbitrum Impact’. We’d like to hold an initial snapshot vote on July 21st with delegate and community support followed by a final vote on July 30th to chose and induct a full board at which point we will transfer coins to a single wallet, and set up the board’s multisig to safekeep the coins.</p>\n<p><strong>8/20-10/20:</strong> Over a 2 month timeline from August 20th until October 20th People Powered will make use of existing tech to respond to crises. We will make our name during this period while showcasing the need for the tech.</p>\n<p><strong>10/30-12/30:</strong> We’ll begin to rollout our tech starting with our chain, network KYC and coin trading.</p>\n<p><strong>January 2025-December 2025:</strong> We’ll begin to rollout the impact network’s actual tooling, when the coins granted to the DAO can be used within our tooling, the DAO should alert the wider community to Arbitrum Impact’s existence and how to use and utilize it as a member of the DAO (through the interfaces that the DAO needs to create, mentioned in the previous section).</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong> – $0 aside from $2000 to cover legal filings for the creation of the 501c3 (which will be covered by People Powered) Board positions will be un-stipended initially with the exception being the cost to prepare and file quarterly financial disclosures as is standard for 501c3 organizations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"thanks-for-reading-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#thanks-for-reading-1\"></a>Thanks for reading,</h4>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to read,</p>\n<p>Danny McGlashing,</p>\n<p>Founder of People Powered - We’re building the world’s first community-based crisis response blockchain, toolkit &amp; global network for humanitarians and communities in crisis everywhere — Powered by You.</p>\n<p>Direct contact outside of the Forums:<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:general@peolepowered.io\">general@peolepowered.io</a></p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-the-establishment-of-arbitrum-impact-a-501c3-funded-by-the-people-powered-blockchain-governed-by-the-arbitrum-dao/24945\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-the-establishment-of-arbitrum-impact-a-501c3-funded-by-the-people-powered-blockchain-governed-by-the-arbitrum-dao/24945","pubDate":"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 03:59:37 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24945"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-the-establishment-of-arbitrum-impact-a-501c3-funded-by-the-people-powered-blockchain-governed-by-the-arbitrum-dao/24945.rss","#text":"Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: The Establishment of ‘Arbitrum Impact’ a 501c3 Funded by the People Powered Blockchain, Governed by the Arbitrum DAO"},"filter":false},{"title":"AIP BOLD Security Analysis","dc:creator":"openzeppelin","category":"Security Member","description":"<h2><a name=\"abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Authors:<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/red-swan\"> @red-swan @michael-oz</a></p>\n<p>BOLD is a new dispute mechanism for Arbitrum which is permissionless and mitigates delay attacks. OpenZeppelin was asked by the ARDC to review the<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232\"> AIP</a>. We assume that readers have read the<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232\"> AIP</a> or at least the<a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/bold/gentle-introduction\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> gentle introduction</a> to which the AIP refers. Our analysis focuses on the parameters of BOLD involving the distribution of confiscated funds and their implications for the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impressions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#impressions-2\"></a>Impressions</h2>\n<p>Overall we were impressed with the amount of work that went into creating BOLD as well as the thoroughness of the analysis, and the quality of the documentation. The several documents linked in the AIP describe its intricacies well and do so effectively to the different target audiences. If they could be improved, we would suggest adopting a single nomenclature across the several documents (e.g. “<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232\">challenge bond</a>” vs. “<a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">mini-bond</a>”, “<a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">challenge period 1</a>” vs. ”<a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dispute period</a>”).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"confiscated-funds-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#confiscated-funds-3\"></a>Confiscated Funds</h2>\n<p>The current validation scheme allows anyone to propose the next state in a canonical state chain, and users stake funds on which state they believe to be the correct next state. This proposed next state could be wrong, so anyone is allowed to dispute a proposed state within a confirmation period and losing a dispute means your assertion stake is confiscated. We were asked to consider possible ways for confiscated funds to be rewarded within the system. The research provided is extremely concerned about collusion between challengers, and we share this concern.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"reward-funds-based-on-actual-network-delay-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#reward-funds-based-on-actual-network-delay-4\"></a>Reward funds based on actual network delay</h3>\n<p>One of the strengths of BOLD is that creating disputes does not significantly delay confirmation of the blocks assuming that there is no censorship of honest parties. So in a world without censorship, consider an honest party that is disputed by a malicious user. If their dispute ends before the challenge period is over, then no delay to the network has taken place and the honest block will become confirmed. If in reality both parties were the same and the malicious user was disputing with themselves, then it shouldn’t matter if they get a portion of their own stake as they’ve caused no delay and submitted an honest state for the network. The principle stated in the Economics paper is to have the assertion bond amount equal to the opportunity cost to the network of the maximum delay (one week). And this we believe could be a guiding principle in rewarding confiscated funds. Honest parties could get more of the confiscated funds the less time an honest state is delayed in confirmation. For example, consider bad states being posted and pruned quickly, honest parties could receive those funds.</p>\n<p>Now let us consider censorship. If an honest state confirmation were delayed past the challenge period because honest parties were censored from sending dispute transactions, then it becomes less costly for malicious parties to delay the network if they are part of the honest party and receive their own confiscated stake. This is textbook griefing and should be discouraged. But there could be a sliding scale between the two scenarios. The function could be nuanced with cliffs where no rewards are transferred or exponentially decay as a state is delayed, but the overarching incentive could be in place where honest parties receive confiscated funds and more if state is not delayed.</p>\n<p>There are some nuances surrounding waiting for paying out only to confirmed blocks. For example, if a bad state actor can censor honest parties from asserting, they can play disputes with themselves and win their own disputes but the “winning” bad state will not be confirmed once honest parties are able to send transactions to the network. They should not receive their rewards in this scenario and this delaying of paying rewards leads into another idea for how confiscated funds could be paid to honest parties.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"postpone-rewarding-funds-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#postpone-rewarding-funds-5\"></a>Postpone rewarding funds</h3>\n<p>Next, consider a scenario where dishonest stakes are given to honest parties after six months. And again, let us consider the scenario above where a malicious user raises disputes with themselves at every honest state they post, delaying confirmation of states for as long as possible with censorship. Such a malicious user would need extraordinary capital to continuously delay states for six months. In such a scenario, if the DAO were able to recognize the network duress and also were able to vote and stop the delayed reward payments, the malicious user’s attack would then become much more expensive to continue (hopefully prohibitively more expensive). Our understanding is that BOLD does not preclude determined, large entities from performing this kind of attack. Indeed, any such optimistic rollup is susceptible to this. However, the network duress would be quite obvious and allow the DAO to make decisions about delaying rewards to protect the network.</p>\n<p>Now consider a malicious user that does not have the capital to perform this attack continuously. They would be able to perform the attack more often after receiving rewards for disputing with themselves. However, the actual rewards would be delayed substantially, perhaps enough so that the delays they cause to the network provide no material difficulty for its users. Therefore, the longer an honest party has to wait for their funds, the less the risk of delays to the network and, therefore, the greater the share of the confiscated funds could be paid. And again, if there are enough malicious users out there to cause delays to the network (perhaps all operating separately), giving the DAO the ability to turn off the payments should discourage the “market” for bad states.</p>\n<p>The obvious criticism with this method is that it introduces a special role into a permissionless system. But this is already a component of the AIP, giving the DAO all of the confiscated funds and the ability to use those funds how they wish. This privileged role the DAO will have in these cases can always be removed in newer iterations of the dispute protocol. So its temporary power to pause delayed rewards does not seem so unpalatable.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-changing-economic-environment-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-changing-economic-environment-6\"></a>The Changing Economic Environment</h2>\n<p>BOLD sufficiently incentivizes parties to behave in ways that are beneficial to the network. Indeed, the success of BOLD relies on some of these incentives being <em>sufficient at all times</em> to induce the desired behavior. To this end, we were very pleased to see the proposal including the idea about service fees being paid to validators and honest disputers. This may be enough to incentivize validators and it may be the case that there need not be any further reward policy for confiscated funds. But it is an utmost priority to observe how these incentives actually perform. Should validators/disputers simply find better things to do with their locked assertion assets, they will leave their role, and the network will suffer. BOLD does a good job of guaranteeing the correctness of the state chain as long as one honest member exists. However, there exists a very perverse incentive for the last honest actor to be dishonest since no one is left to challenge them. So, in practice, more than one honest actor is ideal, and monitoring the health of the validator pool should become an ongoing DAO responsibility. We would hope that the number of validators and the amounts staked become a regular talking point, brought up at large. In fact, we recommend the DAO regularly monitor and discuss all of the factors in the proposal that determine the economic parameters at least until the community feels incredibly confident with BOLD’s performance. These parameters include the price of WETH, yield rates, the TVL of the bridge, the time-to-depletion for DAO payouts, and more. Gathering this information could be a simple, manual task performed by a specific DAO entity, and many of these values seem scrapable which would make this monitoring even easier. In this sense, adopting BOLD should be understood as the DAO adopting the responsibility for the economics of BOLD and the community’s confidence in it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-7\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Given the serious security implications of allowing permissionless disputes, we are pleased and impressed with the level of thoroughness with which the Offchain Labs team and Arbitrum community has discussed the risks of BOLD.</p>\n<p>We explored concerns with the handling of confiscated funds as well as the future need to monitor and update BOLD parameters as economic conditions change. The algorithm has been well thought-out and should work as expected. However, it does depend on economic incentives behaving under present economic conditions that are subject to change. We recommend monitoring the economic factors of BOLD once in production and be ready to make adjustments as needed.</p>\n<p>For more information on OpenZeppelin’s role as Security Member of ARDC, please visit our<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Security-Member-OpenZeppelin-8f0d23fa622e43329b530129769a7834\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Notion homepage 1</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Our first version of this post attempted to explain BOLD in terms of the “Classic” dispute mechanism but confused some readers because it didn’t clearly distinguish between censorship and non-censorship scenarios.
