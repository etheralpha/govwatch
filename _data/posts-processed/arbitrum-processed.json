As per STIP guidelines, projects were mandated to distribute their entire grant allocation by March 29, 2024, with any surplus funds being returned to the Arbitrum Multisig. This resulted in the return of approximately 736k claimed ARB tokens at the end of the STIP.</p>\n<p>Due to varying initial distribution dates for each project, we established a cut-off date for assessing performance metrics relative to the respective initial distribution dates.

Notably, protocols supported by the STIP collectively realized a 118.2% increase in TVL over the same period, constituting approximately 75.8% of the total TVL growth on Arbitrum. In contrast, non-STIP protocols on Arbitrum collectively increased their TVL by 35.6%, underscoring the significant outperformance of STIP grantees, whose TVL growth surpassed that of non-STIP projects by 82.6 percentage points.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum saw a notable 76.4% increase in DAU, adding around 94,000 new daily users. While Base experienced a larger surge of 136,000 DAU and surpassed Arbitrum, Arbitrum still outpaced Optimism by approximately 46,000 users.</p>\n<p>An essential gauge for assessing the effectiveness of the STIP incentives is the normalized growth relative to the claimed ARB grants. When applying individual cut-off dates to account for each protocol’s initial incentive distributions, STIP grantees collectively generated $13.95 in TVL growth for every $1 of ARB incentives claimed and added 37 additional users engaging on a daily basis per 100,000 ARB claimed. Excluding Galxe, this figure rises to 57 additional users.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"transaction-count-and-fees-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#transaction-count-and-fees-5\"></a>Transaction Count and Fees</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ih8y4okd5UBBbW8nG8KiBjeq31E.png?dl=1\" title=\"|624x351.33365019011404\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"|624x351.33365019011404\" data-base62-sha1=\"ih8y4okd5UBBbW8nG8KiBjeq31E\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F4F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The transaction volume on Arbitrum increased by 101.9%, exceeding 1 million transactions per day by the end of the STIP.

In December, the Arbitrum One sequencer experienced a brief outage, resulting in a backlog of transactions. Upon restoration, the network processed an all-time high of over 5 million transactions, briefly elevating transaction counts and fee metrics. Subsequently, transaction volumes began to rise again in March, coinciding with the network’s introduction of blob transactions, which notably reduced user transaction fees paid in ETH.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"efficacy-across-verticals-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#efficacy-across-verticals-6\"></a>Efficacy Across Verticals</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"key-takeaways-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-takeaways-7\"></a>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pendle outperformed all grantees in TVL growth, gaining an incremental $150.01 per ARB claimed.</li>\n<li>Balancer demonstrated the highest efficiency in increasing daily user activity relative to claimed ARB</li>\n<li>Gamma stood out as the leader in annualized fee growth relative to claimed ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"tvl-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tvl-8\"></a>TVL</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hBdxXgjKAuzcKqnl3KzFzWkF71I.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hBdxXgjKAuzcKqnl3KzFzWkF71I\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF0F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Among the DeFi verticals, the yield category emerged as the frontrunner in TVL growth, increasing by 647.5%.

Normalized by claimed ARB, this growth equates to an additional $2.61 in TVL. Notably, perpetuals have shown to be six times less efficient in attracting TVL through incentives compared to the DEX category, reflecting differing incentive structures. Perpetuals incentivize traders directly through volume-based incentives or trading fee rebates, while DEXs focus solely on incentivizing liquidity providers.</p>\n<p>Vertex emerged as a standout performer within the perpetuals category, contributing to 66% of the nominal TVL growth. Moreover, Vertex demonstrated superior efficiency in increasing TVL with incentives, being at least 5 times more effective than other protocols within the perpetuals category.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that GMX’s ARB grant was utilized to incentivize the adoption of GMX V2. By the end of the STIP, GMX V2’s share of the protocol’s TVL increased from 20% to 68%, indicating a successful migration of liquidity from V1 to V2. Normalized, this $217 million increase in TVL for GMX V2 translates to an additional $11.30 per dollar of ARB claimed, positioning GMX V2 as a close contender to Vertex in terms of incentive-driven TVL growth.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"fees-and-volume-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#fees-and-volume-21\"></a>Fees and Volume</h4>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qkVcs4uw5PZ3PhVeyzEvdmXIoro.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"qkVcs4uw5PZ3PhVeyzEvdmXIoro\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F4F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The perpetuals category realized a $102.3M increase in annualized fees compared to the pre-incentive figures. GMX led in normalized growth, generating an additional $3.31 annually per dollar of ARB claimed. Regarding daily volumes, this group exhibited the highest growth among all categories, increasing by $656.6M (+196.2%) to $991.2M. Normalized, this equates to an additional $18.86 in volume. Vertex led in efficiency here, being at least 2.5 times more efficient at increasing volume with incentives than the rest of the group.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-22\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Arbitrum’s inaugural round of the STIP has yielded significant insights into the effectiveness of ARB incentives across various ecosystem segments. Through examining a range of KPIs, it’s evident that STIP-supported projects have made substantial strides in enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem’s vitality and growth.</p>\n<p>One of the most notable observations is the outperformance of STIP grantees compared to non-STIP protocols. Protocols supported by the STIP accounted for 75.8% of the nominal TVL growth on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, vertical analysis revealed nuanced trends within different sectors. While the DEX category demonstrated the highest efficiency in attracting new users relative to incentives claimed, the lending category led in efficiency for attracting TVL. Additionally, perpetuals showed lower efficiency in attracting TVL compared to DEXs but demonstrated the highest efficiency in increasing trading volume.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the findings from the STIP highlight the pivotal role of incentives in fostering ecosystem development and user engagement on Arbitrum. Moving forward, continued assessment and refinement of incentive mechanisms will be crucial in sustaining growth momentum and ensuring the long-term success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"about-openblock-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#about-openblock-23\"></a>About OpenBlock</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://openblocklabs.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenBlock</a> is a data-driven platform dedicated to incentive engineering, fostering sustainable growth within decentralized protocols.

This company is being built by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattFiebach\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Matt Fiebach</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swmartin19\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sam Martin</a>, and bootstrapped with the help of the Arbitrum Foundation as a grant recipient.</p>\n<p>We were the first two employees at <a href=\"https://www.blockworksresearch.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockworks Research</a>, where we built a Saas-based research product offering deep investment insights to institutional crypto investors via long-form research, onchain analytics, and a governance screener. Matt spearheaded the services and governance operations, while Sam focused on the product and day-to-day operations. We scaled a team from 0 to 14 people, grew a daily newsletter and a twitter/X account to 10’s of thousands of readers/followers, launched and hosted the 0xResearch podcast, and more. We have developed vast networks within the crypto industry, and plan to leverage that network and experience to help the Arbitrum DAO operate more efficiently, effectively, and professionally.</p>\n<p>We have identified some pain points within Arbitrum DAO through our experience working directly with the DAO over the past year. Some of these problems include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>● DAO Alignment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitrun DAO does not have a neutral party to broker proposals, ensure high quality RFP applicants, and generally serve as the steward for proposals. The DAO doesn’t know the ulterior motives and incentives of proposal authors, and there is often a lack of alignment between both of these entities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Collective Action Problem &amp; Proposal Stalemate</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Situations where there is a recognized need or solution that would benefit the broader ecosystem, but individual actors lack sufficient incentives to take action due to asymmetric benefits/costs. There is a lack of dedicated resources to execute strategies and see them through the lifecycle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Procuring &amp; Maintaining Contributors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Arbitrum DAO has trouble attracting full-time, high quality talent given its lack of ability to hire/employ these individuals. There is no incentive to be a full-time DAO contributor. Even with economic incentives (eg ARDC,) many of the top businesses within the industry at their respective specialty miss on these opportunities simply because they are unaware of the opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Strategic Partner Onboarding &amp; Growth</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Arbitrum DAO primarily relies on the Foundation as its BD arm, but having an additional Arbitrum aligned entity to assist in finding strategic partners could yield a richer set of partners to choose from.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Stakeholder Relations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information pipelines are broken between key stakeholders of the Arbitrum network including the Delegates, Protocols, the Foundation, and Offchain Labs, and other service providers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We started Entropy Advisors to alleviate some of these problems within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This list is non-exhaustive, and we would love to know if the community sees any pain points that Entropy could help solve.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Firstly, our product addresses the pressing need for high, stable and sustainable yield opportunities in the institutional DeFi space. We provide diversified yields sourced from real-world private credit assets, akin to MakerDAO’s approach with RWA. This strategy is poised to attract larger risk-averse DAO treasuries, offering yields derived from real-world assets, which presents a less volatile alternative to yields based on token emissions. Additionally, these yields are stable due to the lack of correlation of returns with both crypto assets and traditional public market risky assets such as equities and bonds, further enhancing their appeal to institutional investors seeking reliable investment options.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we are poised to drive significant innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Our proprietary Credit Analytics platform processes millions of loan data points, providing real-time credit and fraud insights, backed by six years of proprietary data from various lending sectors in Southeast Asia. With the unique position of being the sole RWA private credit platform with a track record of 6 years, we are able to leverage extensive loan data to incorporate machine learning for accurate default prediction, enhancing our private credit deal origination at HELIX for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, as we scale beyond Southeast Asia and APAC, where we are sourcing our immediate set of highly curated deals leveraging Helicap’s deal origination capabilities, we have a planned decentralized credit approver mechanism that will continue to ensure the quality of deals brought onto the platform. These credit approvers will not be random token holders; instead, they will comprise a thoroughly vetted panel of global credit institutions and individual credit professionals like CPAs and CFAs with a proven track record in the private credit space. They will be incentivized to perform credit due diligence. Leveraging HELIX’s proprietary credit analytics and other aspects of each deal, they will provide detailed credit memos. A deal will only be made available to lenders on the platform if a majority of the Credit Approvers have approved it. We envision that these approvers will be akin to real-world credit agencies such as S&amp;P, Moody’s, and Fitch, where no single loan is approved by just one agency but by multiple agencies. Moreover, these approvers can be integrated with other future private credit protocols, enhancing their composability and utility.</p>\n<p>Fourthly, as HELIX is targeting institutions, this will not only enhance the reputation of Arbitrum as an institutional-grade Layer 2 solution but also secure more sticky and long-term TVL that doesn’t dissipate like retail investments in a bear market.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we are looking to address financial inclusion in emerging markets. These loans will support borrowers in underserved sectors such as consumer, agriculture, education, and SMEs, generating meaningful real-world changes.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Our strategies are designed to maximize returns by balancing risk and reward efficiently, drawing on our team’s deep expertise in hedge fund management and derivatives, and institutional grade infrastructure.</p>\n<p>From the Arbitrum perspective, the strong competitive advantage of our ARB++ managed strategy over other proposals is that it doesn’t require the Foundation to sell any ARB, which may be less optimal from an optics standpoint, while also driving additional ARB token volume throughout the ecosystem as collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Yield:</strong><br>\nD2 Finance’s approach to generating risk adjusted returns is deeply rooted in sophisticated active trading strategies, similar to those utilized by market makers and asset management firms. These strategies are inherently subject to market volatility and are designed to capitalize on this volatility to achieve a positive expected value (EV) over the long term. Thus we do not advertise a base yield at the start of an epoch; instead, our yield is dynamically generated based on the performance of our active trading strategies.</p>\n<p>D2 brings the sophistication of a top tier hedge fund, 100% on-chain, 100% non-custodial</p>\n<p><strong>ETH++ Strategy:</strong> 84.3% ROI (247% annualized) since inception 22 Dec 2023.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>We have created a digital asset security that represents a share of a regulated money market mutual fund. The Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, also known as the BENJI token, provides an opportunity for Arbitrum to practice sound treasury management while also generating attractive income. The BENJI token is a competitive solution for Treasury fund diversification, while also acting as an additional source of income generation through competitive yield. Any income generated by investing in the BENJI token can provide additional capital to aid in the development of new products, technology, or other initiatives deemed important to Arbitrum’s DAO.</p>\n<p>This on-chain money market mutual fund, the BENJI token, is designed to provide transparency by using blockchain technology to process transactions and record share ownership. The fund’s transfer agent maintains the official record of share ownership via a proprietary blockchain-integrated system that utilizes a public blockchain for recording transactional activity, known as the Benji platform. Ensuring the safety and stability of a DAO’s Treasury is of the utmost importance and, as a result, many invest in stablecoins to try to preserve capital. Stablecoin providers invest the underlying assets across many different investment types to generate return but rarely pass that return onto holders of the stablecoin. In BENJI’s case, we believe that the Arbitrum DAO Treasury can not only receive the benefit of capital preservation but can also earn any income generated from the fund’s holdings. Although the Treasury may be able to accommodate a larger investment than $150mm (a potential of up to $500mm), we would advise allowing the Fund’s size to grow before increasing the allocation.</p>\n<p>As mentioned later in the plan design section, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund invests 99.5% of its total assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash.</p>\n<p>We would like to advocate for the Arbitrum DAO Treasury to liquidate a portion of its reserves and invest in the BENJI token. Please see Appendix 1 – <em>Say Hello to Benji</em> for more information on the Fund and the process for investing.</p>\n<p>The BENJI token represents shares of a government money market mutual fund that’s registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 but performs the transfer agent transaction record-keeping function via public blockchains. It’s important to note that there is no personal identifiable information publicly available on the blockchain, just transaction-level data. Unlike many similar offerings, the Benji platform records transaction records and fund ownership via a public blockchain, which means that the DAO would have increased transparency and assurance that their assets are in good stead. The DAO Treasury can interact with their account at any time using our Benji Institutional interface and provide a look through to their holdings using the Stellar Explorer or the Polygon PoS Chain Explorer.</p>\n<p>Please see below for a preview of our institutional interface supporting the BENJI token.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\"

Identify key management personnel and individual experience. Also include third parties utilized for managing assets and their qualifications.</strong></p>\n<p>The two portfolio managers on this Fund are Shawn Lyons and Johnson Ng, with 27 and 26 years of service, respectively. The portfolio managers seek to build a diversified portfolio of Government securities. Government securities include those issued by government agencies or instrumentalities, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks, whose securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Government.</p>\n<p>The portfolio managers make the final security selection decisions, consistent with desired overall risk positioning, and based on relative pricing and trading liquidity. Throughout the portfolio construction process, dedicated risk analysts collaborate with the portfolio managers to identify the level and sources of risk and help determine optimal position sizing.</p>\n<p>We do not utilize third parties for managing assets as investment management functions are managed in-house. However, the Fund utilizes the following third parties for its sub-administrator, custodian and independent registered public accounting firm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sub-administrator:</strong> JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

Describe any previous work by the entity or its officers/key contributors similar to that requested. References are encouraged.</strong></p>\n<p>Franklin Templeton Digital Assets has been engaged in intensive research and technical development within the digital asset ecosystem for the last several years, developing technology platforms and strategy differentiation to help clients achieve their investment goals in this new asset class, all while supporting and investing in digital asset networks. We believe that, in this space, everything is interconnected and thus take a holistic approach to the ecosystem. We have developed blockchain-native expertise and are committed to distinct pillars across the digital asset economy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Digital Assets Technology: Franklin Templeton Digital Assets believes that blockchain technology has the ability to create efficiencies across a variety of business processes, which is why we are building our own blockchain-based technology solutions to support these assets in the investment management space. Our team built a full service blockchain-based technology stack to support a blockchain-enabled money fund, which includes a digital transfer agent platform, digital asset management system, and digital wallet infrastructure.<br>\nIn April 2021, we launched the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to use blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership. In early 2022, we expanded the availability of the Fund through our Benji Investments app and designated the Stellar network’s blockchain as the Fund’s official record of share ownership. In 2023, we further expanded the availability of the Fund to the Polygon blockchain network. Token holders can gain exposure to the Fund in digital wallets through the Benji Investments app or our institutional website, and we believe that eventually these tokens may be interchangeable with the rest of the digital asset ecosystem. The Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund had over US$360 million under management as of March 31, 2024.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Digital Assets Investment Strategies: Franklin Templeton Digital Assets believes that digital assets are frontier risk alternatives™ and have the potential to generate capital appreciation in the long-term. We also believe that, as with many investment types, much of the alpha generation in this space can occur in the early stages. We are engaged in the early stages of the digital assets market and build portfolios of tokens that are listed on exchanges.<br>\nOur team has developed capabilities to invest in early-stage, private blockchain-focused companies. This investment process includes new techniques developed by the team to help expand our opportunity set using proprietary quantamental research methods. Franklin Templeton Digital Assets also invests in listed tokens and has developed new ways of evaluating these digital assets from both a quantitative and fundamental (tokenomics) perspective.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Node Operations: Franklin Templeton believes that it should be a part of the blockchain networks in which we operate. Running validators and providing staking services can have an impact on client portfolios and help drive potential returns, so we have been developing strategies around this exciting capability. We have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019. In 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Has your entity or its officers/key contributors been subject to an enforcement action, criminal action, or defaulted on legal or financial obligations? Please describe the circumstances if so.</strong></p>\n<p>No, with respect to <em>investment-related</em> regulatory matters, during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, neither Franklin Advisers, Inc.

Describe any conflicts of interest for your entity and key personnel.</strong></p>\n<p>Franklin Templeton’s policy is to take all reasonable steps to maintain and operate effective organizational and administrative controls to identify and manage relevant conflicts that may occur between Franklin Templeton and its clients or between multiple clients.</p>\n<p>The following list provides a summary of the main conflicts we have identified and the controls in place to manage such conflicts within the Franklin Templeton group.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Franklin Templeton Seed Money versus Shareholders’ Investment. As part of normal business practice, Franklin Templeton will invest money, initially, at the launch of a fund in order to diversify and attract clients. The policy is that an investment by Franklin Templeton is treated in a manner that is believed to not conflict with the interests of any client.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fairness of Trading Allocation and Order Priority among Clients.

Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>Fund distributions, which will be automatically reinvested in additional shares, are generally taxable to you as ordinary income, capital gains or some combination of both. Investment company dividends paid to you from interest earned on certain U.S. government securities may be exempt from state and local taxation, subject in some states to minimum investment or reporting requirements that must be met by the Fund.</p>\n<p>Dividend income: Income dividends are generally subject to tax at ordinary rates. Because the Fund invests primarily in debt securities, it is expected that none of the Fund’s income dividends will be qualified dividends subject to reduced rates of taxation to individuals. A return-of-capital distribution is generally not taxable but will reduce the cost basis of your shares, and will result in a higher capital gain or a lower capital loss when you later sell your shares.</p>\n<p>Capital gains: Fund distributions of short-term capital gains are also subject to tax at ordinary rates. Because the Fund is a money market fund, it does not expect to realize and distribute any long-term capital gains on its investments.</p>\n<p>Sales of Fund shares: Because the Fund seeks to maintain a $1.00 per share NAV, sales of its shares will not generally result in a taxable capital gain or loss for federal or state income tax purposes.</p>\n<p>Medicare tax: An additional 3.8% Medicare tax is imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received from the Fund and net gains from redemptions or other taxable dispositions of Fund shares) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent that such person’s “modified adjusted gross income” (in the case of an individual) or “adjusted gross income” (in the case of an estate or trust) exceeds a threshold amount. Any liability for this additional Medicare tax is reported on, and paid with, your federal income tax return.</p>\n<p>Backup withholding: A shareholder may be subject to backup withholding on any distributions of income and capital gains if the shareholder has provided either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, has failed to certify that the shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or has not certified that the shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. State backup withholding may also apply.</p>\n<p>State and local taxes: Distributions of ordinary income and capital gains, if any are generally subject to state and local taxes. However, distributions of ordinary income paid to individual shareholders from interest earned by the Fund on certain U.S. Government obligations may be exempt from state and local income taxation depending on the state. Shareholders should contact their tax advisors with respect to the state and local income tax consequences of investing in the Fund, including whether Fund dividends derived from interest on U.S. government obligations held by the Fund qualify for tax free treatment.</p>\n<p>Non-U.S. investors: Non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. withholding tax at 30% or a lower treaty rate on Fund dividends of ordinary income. Non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. estate tax on the value of their shares. They are subject to special U.S. tax certification requirements to avoid backup withholding, claim any exemptions from withholding and claim any treaty benefits. Exemptions from U.S. withholding tax are generally provided for capital gains realized on the sale of Fund shares, capital gain dividends paid by the Fund from net long-term capital gains, short-term capital gain dividends paid by the Fund from net short-term capital gains and interest-related dividends paid by the Fund from its qualified net interest income from U.S. sources. However, notwithstanding such exemptions from U.S. withholding tax at source, any such dividends and distributions of income and capital gains will be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24% if you fail to properly certify that you are not a U.S. person.</p>\n<p>Other reporting and withholding requirements: Payments to a shareholder that is either a foreign financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity within the meaning of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) may be subject to a 30% withholding tax on income dividends paid by the Fund. The FATCA withholding tax generally can be avoided by such foreign entity if it provides the Fund, and in some cases, the IRS, information concerning the ownership of certain foreign financial accounts or other appropriate certifications or documentation concerning its status under FATCA. The Fund may be required to report certain shareholder account information to the IRS, non-U.S. taxing authorities or other parties to comply with FATCA.</p>\n<p>Other tax information: This discussion of “Distributions and Taxes” is for general information only and is not tax advice. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding your particular circumstances, and about any federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences before making an investment in the Fund. Additional information about the tax consequences of investing in the Fund may be found in the SAI.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>All Fund transactions must be conducted via the Institutional Web Portal.</p>\n<p>You can redeem your shares at any time through the Institutional Web Portal, although redemptions of Fund shares will only be processed during normal business hours on business days.</p>\n<p>As long as your transaction is for $250,000 or less, you can sell your shares via the Institutional Web Portal without a signature guarantee. Institutional investors making redemptions via the Institutional Web Portal will use a submitter/approver process to authorize transactions.</p>\n<p>Redemption proceeds will be sent by electronic funds transfer (ACH or Fed Wire) from your Institutional Web Portal account to your bank account within seven days after we receive your request in proper form.</p>\n<p>Before requesting to have redemption proceeds sent to a bank account, please make sure we have your current bank account information on file.</p>\n<p>If the bank account was added or changed within the last 15 days, you may be required to provide written instructions signed by all Fund account owners, with a signature guarantee for each Fund account owner.</p>\n<p>If we receive your request in proper form prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time, or the regularly scheduled close of the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier, proceeds sent by ACH generally will be available within two to three business days.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>Since the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund is a stable Net Asset Value (NAV) product invested in U.S. government securities, we would not anticipate a situation where the Fund, or its underlying securities, become impaired.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund only buys securities that the investment manager determines present minimal credit risks. The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 calendar days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average life for its portfolio of 120 calendar days or less, and only buys securities that mature or are deemed to mature in 397 calendar days or less.</p>\n<p>The Fund uses the amortized cost method of valuation to seek to maintain a stable $1.00 share price and does not currently intend to impose liquidity fees or redemption gates on Fund redemptions.</p>\n<p>All Fund transactions for institutional customers must be conducted via the Institutional Web Portal.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in question 9 above in the “plan design” section, as long as your transaction is for $250,000 or less, you can sell your shares via the Institutional Web Portal without a signature guarantee. Institutional investors making redemptions via the Institutional Web Portal will use a submitter/approver process to authorize transactions.</p>\n<p>Redemption proceeds will be sent by electronic funds transfer (ACH or Fed Wire) from your Institutional Web Portal account to your bank account within seven days after we receive your request in proper form.</p>\n<p>Before requesting to have redemption proceeds sent to a bank account, please make sure we have your current bank account information on file.</p>\n<p>If the bank account was added or changed within the last 15 days, you may be required to provide written instructions signed by all Fund account owners, with a signature guarantee for each Fund account owner.</p>\n<p>If we receive your request in proper form prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time, or the regularly scheduled close of the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier, proceeds sent by ACH generally will be available within two to three business days.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s transfer agent maintains the official record of share ownership via a proprietary blockchain-integrated system that utilizes features of traditional book-entry form and one or more public blockchain networks. The use of blockchain technology is relatively new and still evolving for mutual funds. Similar to traditional fund recordkeeping systems, all Fund and shareholder records in the blockchain-integrated system are under the full and complete control of the Fund’s transfer agent.</p>\n<p>The recording of Fund shares on the blockchain will not affect the Fund’s investments. The Fund intends to be a Government money market fund. Accordingly, the Fund will invest, consistent with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act, at least 99.5% of its total assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash. The Fund will not invest in any cryptocurrencies (referred to as, among other things, virtual currencies).</p>\n<p>Complex information technology and communications systems, such as blockchain networks, are subject to a number of different threats or risks that could adversely affect the Fund. If such an event occurs, the Fund may incur substantial costs. In addition, market events also may trigger a volume of transactions that overloads current information technology and communication systems and processes, impacting the ability to conduct the Fund’s operations. The Fund may never achieve market acceptance and may not be able to attract sizable assets or achieve scale. The Fund’s investment manager expects that the blockchain-integrated recordkeeping system will provide operational efficiencies without negatively impacting the quality of the transfer agent’s services.</p>\n<p><strong>13.

The ERMC includes executive and senior-level representatives from all areas of Franklin Templeton’s business and operations.<br>\nThe ERMC’s primary roles are to:<br>\n·        Provide guidance and support for the ERM program<br>\n·        Promote risk management at all levels of the organization<br>\n·        Review, discuss, and refresh the key enterprise risks (and other significant risks)<br>\n·        Review, discuss, and monitor emerging risks and potential threats<br>\n·        Provide a framework to assist business, regional risk committees, and support units to identify, assess, and manage risks<br>\n·        Assess management’s programs and responses for each risk<br>\n·        Report to management, the Audit Committee, and Board of Directors (key enterprise risks, programs &amp; responses, and status of the ERM program)<br>\nThe ERMC is comprised of the following executive and senior level members:<br>\n·        SVP, Head of Enterprise Risk &amp; Committee Chair<br>\n·        Head of Enterprise Risk (EMEA)<br>\n·        SVP, Quality Assurance, Risk and Control<br>\n·        Chief Privacy Officer<br>\n·        EVP, Chief Risk Officer<br>\n·        SVP, Global Alliances<br>\n·        Director, Global Audit<br>\n·        SVP, Global Treasurer &amp; Head of M&amp;A<br>\n·        SVP, Corporate Real Estate &amp; Aviation Services<br>\n·        SVP, Chief Security Officer<br>\n·        EVP, Financial Planning &amp; Strategies<br>\n·        President – FTIS, Head of Global Shareholder Services<br>\n·        President – FTS<br>\n·        SVP, Global Client Partnering (Human Resources)<br>\n·        Chief Information Officer<br>\n·        SVP, Head of Business Management &amp; Ops (Public Markets)<br>\n·        EVP, General Counsel<br>\n·        SVP, Chief Communications Officer<br>\n·        EVP, Global Alliances &amp; New Business Strategy<br>\n·        Head of Product Strategy &amp; Management<br>\n·        Head of Investment Risk<br>\n·        EVP, Operations<br>\n·        EVP, Chief Accounting Officer<br>\n·        Chief Risk Officer - India<br>\n·        Chief Operating Officer - Distribution<br>\nThe Head of Enterprise Risk and the ERM team members provide ongoing support and guidance to subsidiary level risk management committees and functions to best leverage the firm’s ERM processes and standards, align risk activities, and ensure transparency of risk information and reporting across the firm. ERM team members also attend legal entity and business risk committee meetings to promote communication and consideration of risk management practices and findings throughout the organization. There are also regional and legal entity risk committees that meet regularly. All regional groups are modelled after the ERMC, with similar risk practices and processes, along with some adaptation based on the size and scope of the region.<br>\nFor a copy of Franklin Templeton’s full risk management policy, please reach out to <a href=\"mailto:FTDigitalAssets@franklintempleton.com\">FTDigitalAssets@franklintempleton.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Performance Reporting</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. What are your proposed performance benchmarks? If this is substantially different from the underlying assets, please explain why.</strong></p>\n<p>The Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund does not track a benchmark index as it is structured as a “Government money market fund,” as such term is defined in or interpreted under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act). The Fund seeks to provide investors with as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of shareholders’ capital and liquidity. The Fund also tries to maintain a stable $1.00 share price.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the content, format, preparation process, and cadence of performance reports. This should include proof of reserves, if appropriate. Please include a sample report.</strong></p>\n<p>Performance and portfolio reporting is completed quarterly, by the third week after quarter end. The client receives a quarterly packet that includes market commentary and outlook, performance attribution, and a review of the portfolio for the quarter. For a sample report, please contact <a href=\"mailto:FTDigitalAssets@franklintempleton.com\">FTDigitalAssets@franklintempleton.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Who provides the performance reports in respect of the underlying assets?</strong></p>\n<p>The NAV calculation and publication is completed by third party administrators.</p>\n<p>Our dedicated Global Client Service Support Team–with office hubs in London, Singapore, and New York–provides reporting support, working with the firm’s key business units such as Product Management, Portfolio Management, Global Marketing, Performance &amp; Risk, Portfolio Accounting, Legal, and Operations.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe any formal audit process and timing of such audits.</strong></p>\n<p>As an SEC-registered mutual fund, the Fund has a Board of Trustees, an Audit Committee comprised of Independent Trustees, and the Fund’s financial statements are audited by an independent public accounting firm. As mentioned above, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Fund’s independent registered public accounting firm, audits the financial statements included in the Fund’s Annual Report to shareholders. To see a copy of this audit report, please visit page 16 of Appendix 3 – <em>Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund Annual Report</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Pricing</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

The Fund’s gross expense ratio is 0.89%.</p>\n<p>Please see below table for a summary of the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shared of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Annual Fund Operating Expenses</strong></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Management fees</td>\n<td>0.15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Distribution and service (12b-1) fees</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other expenses</td>\n<td>0.74%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total annual Fund operating expenses</td>\n<td>0.89%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement1</td>\n<td>-0.69%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Total annual Fund operating expenses after fee waiver and/or expense</b></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>reimbursement</td>\n<td><strong>0.20%</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ol>\n<li>The investment manager has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse operating expenses (excluding certain non-routine expenses or costs, such as those relating to litigation, indemnification, reorganizations and liquidations) for the Fund so that the ratio of total annual fund operating expenses will not exceed 0.20% until July 31, 2024. During the term, the fee waiver and expense reimbursement agreement may not be terminated or amended without approval of the board of trustees except to add series or classes, to reflect the extension of the termination date or to lower the waiver and expense limitation (which would result in lower fees for shareholders).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3.

Is the project permissioned? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, users of the Benji platform are run through typical KYC/AML verification, and are white listed inside the contract (using ERC-20 roles).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross-chain interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund currently uses the Stellar network as the primary public blockchain and Fund investors will initially hold their wallets on the Stellar network. However, the Fund may also use the Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum networks for certain accounts upon request and subject to eligibility, although one or more of those other blockchain networks may not be available at certain times. It’s important to note that we are not live yet for general availability on Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum networks. Please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:FTDigitalAssets@franklintempleton.com\">FTDigitalAssets@franklintempleton.com</a> to determine your eligibility to hold your wallet on a network other than Stellar and the availability of the other network. Approval to hold your wallet on a network other than Stellar is subject to the sole discretion of the Fund and its transfer agent.</p>\n<p>Shares of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund are available for transfer from one shareholder to another shareholder (“peer-to-peer”) on the public blockchain. Transfers within the same network/chain are currently available, but we’re working on the availability of cross-chain transfers.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>During the onboarding process, Franklin Templeton obtains a list of authorized users sanctioned by the client (full know-your-customer/anti-money laundering performed on all entities and entity persons). Franklin Templeton then sends out an invitation to each authorized user that will allow them to establish their username and password and set up multi-factor authentication using Okta Verify and WebAuthn (FIDO2 Compliant Devices - includes Windows Biometrics with TPM, iOS Passkeys onboarded with QR Codes, etc.).</p>\n<p>For internal users, regular access control reviews are completed across all technical services used by the Digital Assets Technology team on a regular basis, or if there is a change in job function. There are varying levels of access based on job function and division of responsibilities as well. Access is granted based on the principle of least privilege, meaning a user is given the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform his/her job functions.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<p>For tracking, no custom logic is required – it’s ERC-20 compatible. Since user-managed wallet functionality is currently disabled, all operational logic (such as creating purchases and liquidations) has to go through our Institutional Website. There are additional custom functions available such as querying pending transactions.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Supplementary</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

The Fund is a “professional fund” within the meaning of the Securities and Investment Business Act, 2010 (“SIBA”) and accordingly Shares in the Fund are only being offered to and will only be issued to “professional investors” within the meaning of SIBA.</p>\n<p>The Articles are governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands. The Subscription Documents relating to the Fund are governed by the laws of the state of Delaware. The Subscription Documents provide for disputes to be determined by the courts of the Supreme Court, State of New York, New York County and of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>US Regulatory: The Fund is not registered as an investment company and, therefore, is not required to adhere to certain investment policies under the Company Act in reliance on the exemption provided in Section 3(c)(7) of the Company Act with respect to offers made to U.S. persons. As part of the Fund’s responsibility for the prevention of money laundering, the Fund may require a detailed verification of a Shareholder’s identity, the identity of any beneficial owner underlying an investment in the Fund and the source of payment of such investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Contractual:</strong></p>\n<p>There are three primary legal documents associated with investing in BUIDL:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Master Subscription Agreement (“MSA”) (signature required)</li>\n<li>Fund Subscription Agreement (“FSA”) (signature required)</li>\n<li>Private Placement Memorandum (“PPM”) (for reference only)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both the MSA and FSA require investor signature prior to investing; the PPM does not.</p>\n<p>The MSA and FSA are binding agreements. They request information and representations from the investor to determine eligibility for investing in the Fund. They also outline the terms of the Fund that the investor must accept in order to invest. These documents need to be signed by legal signers or authorized representatives of the legal entity/Foundation/DAO (likely multiple individuals). Each legal signer must create a securitizeID account.</p>\n<p>The PPM outlines detailed information about the Fund such as the investment objective, structure, legal considerations, risks, and other important information to consider before investing.</p>\n<p><strong>4.\tWould Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. The transfer agent issues securities at the direction of the issuer and does not own or custody the assets. Should Securitize enter bankruptcy, the role of transfer agent could be transitioned to another provider who could redeem shares with the fund. The fund could also decide to close and return funds to shareholders if a successor transfer agent could not be engaged.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tHow are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-à-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>The custodial relationship of the fund with BNY Mellon is covered under the U.S. Securities Investor Protection Act.</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tDoes the Issuer issue more than one asset?

Additionally, BUIDL shareholders may also be able to directly sell their shares on the secondary market to Circle in exchange for USDC (more detail below).</p>\n<p>The Fund currently cannot accept ARB tokens for subscription, or utilize ARB in the existing secondary market transaction flow; therefore, the investor must manage any conversion of ARB → USD before the subscription flow or conversion from USD/USDC → ARB after exit from the Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>USD Subscription:</strong></p>\n<p>For subscription into BUIDL, the investor must first complete onboarding with Securitize.  This includes all KYC/B requirements for approval into the fund. Once approved, the investor will sign the BUIDL subscription agreement and will be provided with USD funding instructions via the Securitize platform UI.  Upon receipt of funds, tokens will be minted to the wallet address provided during the subscription process.  Funds must be received prior to the daily cutoff time (2:30 PM ET each business day) in order to be minted the same day.  Newly minted tokens will have a 24-hour lock-up period.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f20a4d6c55f7a10a4cbc06a85cfb1417cca6b1ed.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/yxbCu197wb2aQl2vLuU7DskmrtH.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f20a4d6c55f7a10a4cbc06a85cfb1417cca6b1ed_2_690x417.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"yxbCu197wb2aQl2vLuU7DskmrtH\" width=\"690\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f20a4d6c55f7a10a4cbc06a85cfb1417cca6b1ed_2_690x417.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f20a4d6c55f7a10a4cbc06a85cfb1417cca6b1ed.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f20a4d6c55f7a10a4cbc06a85cfb1417cca6b1ed.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F2F2F2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>USD Redemption:</strong></p>\n<p>Investors may redeem directly with the Fund to receive USD via wire transfer to the bank account stored on the records of the Transfer Agent.

If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>Risks resulting from blockchain operations can include the investors’ risk of loss or accessibility to the asset. This can happen for a variety of reasons not limited to a private key being lost or compromised. The Transfer Agent can perform functions to return ownership of the lost asset to a new wallet. Any instance of security vulnerability or access loss should be reported to the Transfer Agent immediately for investigation and remediation. Typically, this would involve any necessary identity verification followed by procedures to burn the compromised tokens and re-issue (mint) to a new wallet address chosen by the investor.</p>\n<p><strong>13.   Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps, OTC agreements)?</strong></p>\n<p>The fund does not invest in derivative products such as swaps or over-the-counter (OTC) agreements.

Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>The project is permissioned. Primary and Secondary trading are limited to whitelisted investors passing a KYC/AML onboarding process.</p>\n<p>Each person seeking to invest in the shares must be, among other things, (i) an “accredited investor” and (ii) either (x) a “qualified purchaser” or a “knowledgeable employee,” in each case as defined under applicable U.S. federal securities laws or (y) a non-U.S. person that is outside of the United States at the time it acquires Shares.</p>\n<p>Each prospective Shareholder will be required to agree that no shares, nor any interest therein, will be transferred (other than to a Whitelisted Account) without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>The Transfer Agent operates a “whitelist” comprising investors or prospective investors who are allowed to subscribe for or acquire shares from Shareholders without needing further suitability checks or anti-money laundering verifications. Transfers between these accounts are generally allowed at any time, even when the Fund isn’t accepting new subscriptions or redemptions, providing flexibility within a controlled environment.</p>\n<p>The Transfer Agent controls the permissions for whitelisting through operations that require the usage of keys that are managed via multi-permission processes using Fireblocks.

What is your entity’s current assets under management, assets held in trust, total value locked, or equivalent metric for your legal structuring?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s TVL is $22m and its volume of transactions is $81.45m.</p>\n<p><strong>11. How many of these assets held are present on Arbitrum One, if any?</strong></p>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<h2>**Plan design** </h2>\n<p><strong>1. Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol enables fixed-rate, fixed-term collateralized loans of cryptoassets, including RWAs for the assets being lent or serving as collateral. The Protocol solves the extreme volatility and rapidly increasing rates in variable rate DeFi markets, which make financing unpredictable and costly for borrowers. Isolated lending pools also enable quick adoption of new collateral types to respond to a rapidly changing market without additional risk to its users.</p>\n<p>The Protocol’s innovative characteristics include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single-Price Sealed Bid Auction Instead of AMM: Instead of using an AMM, Term introduces an innovative auction mechanism that matches lenders and borrowers at a single fixed rate, eliminating slippage and spread issues common in other DeFi lending models.</li>\n<li>Fixed-Rate, Fixed-Term Lending at Scale: Offers stability and scalability in a market known for extreme volatility, enabling both individual and institutional participants to manage and execute financial strategies at scale with predictability.</li>\n<li>Permissioned RWAs: Term is able to support the onboarding of permissioned RWAs as collateral. Term has successfully completed multiple pilot auctions in partnership with Matrixport and their STBT token.</li>\n<li>Isolated Collateral Pools: Each loan is backed by its own segregated collateral pool, enhancing protocol security and enabling customized loan terms and rapid onboarding of new collateral types onto the protocol.</li>\n<li>Capital Efficiency: Unmatched funds are immediately returned to lenders, optimizing capital efficiency and eliminating idle assets.</li>\n<li>Customizable Loan Features for a Variety of Needs: Supports diverse financial needs rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach by allowing customization of loan terms, oracles, and tokens, catering to a wide range of borrowing and lending needs.</li>\n<li>Dynamic Liquidations: Implements an innovative dynamic / soft liquidation mechanism that limits liquidations to the point that take the borrower back to their initial margin ratio - neither too much nor too little.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor or similar rights?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and transparent. Lenders on the Protocol are protected through a collateral liquidation mechanism, specifically an innovative dynamic / soft mechanism that limits liquidations to the point that take the borrower back to their initial margin ratio—neither too much nor too little.</p>\n<p>In addition, each loan is a separate smart contract deployment, which enables isolated collateral pools that reduce the risk of contagion and allows the Protocol to onboard a wider range of collateral types (including RWAs).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is a decentralized collection of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum mainnet and Avalanche (and is expected to be deployed on additional chains, including Arbitrum).</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes—the Protocol is noncustodial and neither Term Foundation nor any entity or person other than Protocol users themselves own the assets being lent or serving as collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>Because the Protocol is entirely onchain, Arbitrum’s assets are not exposed to any brokerage or financial institution.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is not an issuer. However, as described above, the Protocol supports a wide variety of cryptoassets for lending and collateral (including RWAs). Lenders with a specific collateral pool are pari passu with respect to any haircuts due to bad debt.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a detailed cash flow diagram that shows the flow of funds from ARB/Fiat conversion, investment in underlying asset, payment of expenses, sale of underlying asset, and repayment (Fiat/ARB conversion), including the counterparties and legal jurisdictions involved.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ARB is converted to a supported cryptoasset (e.g., USDC or a tokenized RWA).</li>\n<li>The cryptoasset being lent is then used to make loan offers in Protocol auctions or placed in a vault or smart contract that does so.</li>\n<li>As loans mature, the proceeds are collected and either retained or rolled into new auctions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above flow is entirely onchain. The only counterparties are Protocol users borrowing in auctions.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>The yield received would likely be considered interest received on a loan. Although the Protocol’s interface geoblocks the U.S. and does not permit U.S. users, the tax treatment in the U.S. may be instructive—loan interest is typically taxed as ordinary income at the federal level.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>Outstanding loans may either be held through maturity or a buyer can be found for the tokens that represent the right to claim loan repayments.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>As explained above, the Protocol socializes losses across all lenders in a specific isolated collateral pool on a pari passu basis.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p>As described above, outstanding loans may either be held through maturity or a buyer can be found for the tokens that represent the right to claim loan repayments. Under these circumstances liquidity depends on factors such as length to maturity. Loan terms are typically 4 weeks and 4 week ladders can be constructed to have weekly liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and has undergone significant real-use and audit testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its smart contracts have undergone multiple security audits with reputable firms like Sigma Prime, Dedaub, and Runtime Verification.</li>\n<li>It has undergone formal verification using Certora’s prover with thorough protocol coverage (over 200 rules and invariants verified).</li>\n<li>It has achieved a 93% rating from DefiSafey for access controls, audit process, and overall protocol monitoring procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>13. Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps,OTC agreements?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>14. List all the third party counterparties linked to your assets including and not restricted to prime broker if any, custodian, reporting agent, banks for derivatives or loans and provide primary contact details for the third party counterparties</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is noncustodial and neither Term Foundation nor any entity or person other than Protocol users themselves own the assets being lent or serving as collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>15. Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s contributors carefully evaluate new cryptoassets being considered. Factors consider for onboarding collateral assets include 1) Reputable Oracles 2) deep onchain liquidity 3) other factors e.g. withdrawal queues also taken into account.</p>\n<h2>Performance reporting</h2>\n<p><strong>1. What are your proposed performance benchmarks? If this is substantially different from the underlying assets, please explain why.</strong></p>\n<p>Performance should be benchmarked in an asset-specific manner to other lending protocols, such as Aave. Because the Protocol is entirely onchain, performance can be tracked onchain in a transparent manner.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the content, format, preparation process, and cadence of performance reports. This should include proof of reserves, if appropriate. Please include a sample report.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s developers would be able to generate performance reports in a manner to be agreed upon.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Who provides the performance reports in respect of the underlying assets?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s developers.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe any formal audit process and timing of such audits.</strong></p>\n<p>Because the Protocol is entirely onchain, it does not need to undergo financial audits.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Provide a copy of your standard contract, or one similar to what is being proposed here.</strong></p>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<p><strong>2. Fee summary: Inclusive of the full scope of services requested. Product Fee schedule If asset based Fee calculation for our plan if asset based Annual fee if flat fee Any other fees (including redemption or minting fees)</strong></p>\n<p>Protocol users are subject to two types of fees: a loan servicing fee and liquidated damages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Servicing Fee: Borrowers are charged a loan servicing fee, typically ranging from 0.25%-0.50% per annum on the amount borrowed through Term. The servicing fee is a fee earned by the protocol for processing loans, maintaining records, and monitoring collateral. The fee is quoted as an annualized rate applied to and deducted from any loan proceeds obtained as a result of a successful bid by a borrower.</li>\n<li>Protocol Liquidation Fees: Borrowers in default are subject to liquidated damages (a surcharge), which is applied to any debt covered in liquidation and collected in collateral tokens. Liquidated damages are split between liquidators (typically 5.2%) as a liquidation incentive and the Protocol (Protocol liquidated damages, typically set at 2.8%).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Describe frequency of fee payment and its position vis-a-vis payment priority compared with other expenses (i.e., cash waterfall)</strong></p>\n<p>Servicing fees are paid by the borrower upon disbursement of loan proceeds to a borrower in an auction.</p>\n<h2>Smart Contract/Architecture</h2>\n<p><strong>1. How many audits have you had and name of auditors? Please provide a copy of reports.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and has undergone significant real-use and audit testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its smart contracts have undergone multiple security audits with reputable firms like <a href=\"https://developers.term.finance/deployed-contracts/smart-contract-audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sigma Prime, Dedaub, and Runtime Verification</a>.</li>\n<li>It has undergone <a href=\"https://developers.term.finance/deployed-contracts/formal-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">formal verification using Certora’s prover</a> with thorough protocol coverage (over 200 rules and invariants verified).</li>\n<li>It has achieved a <a href=\"https://defisafety.com/app/pqrs/576\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">93% rating from Defi Safey</a> for access controls, audit process, and overall protocol monitoring procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Is the project permissioned? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol can operate in both a permissionless and permissioned manner. For example, the Protocol has a partnership with Matrixport to enable fixed-rate lending against permissioned RWAs. In permissioned assets the protocol also onboards whitelisted liquidators to ensure orderly liquidations. User identities are typically managed through the RWA partner/project’s process.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross chain interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is current available on Ethereum mainnet and Avalanche, with additional chains to be added in the coming months. At the moment there are no cross-chain interactions, but they are being evaluated.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol itself does not have its own RWA tokens. Instead, RWA tokens from other projects can be lent or used as collateral in either a permissioned or permissionless manner.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and lending operates through smart contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol itself does not have its own RWA tokens. Instead, RWA tokens from other projects can be lent or used as collateral in either a permissioned or permissionless manner.</p>\n<h2>Supplementary</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

As an asset that accumulates value and is denominated in USD, mTBILL enables users to borrow traditional stablecoins with higher-than-average loan-to-value ratios while minimizing liquidation risk.<br>\nThis arrangement promotes an influx of stable capital into Arbitrum lending protocols, attracting users seeking favorable rates in the current market environment.</p>\n<p>In isolated pool models, mTBILL enhances interest rates for lenders and borrowers, narrows the rate spread, and offers a method for mitigating bad debt as the collateral asset appreciates. As a permissionless ERC-20 token, mTBILL can be transferred seamlessly in the case of loan default. In single-pool structures, mTBILL can improve rate spreads and boost supply-side yields for traditional stablecoins like DAI, USDC, and USDT.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"capital-commitment-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#capital-commitment-10\"></a><strong>Capital commitment</strong></h4>\n<p>Midas has established an impressive network of investors and co-allocators, including, but not limited to: BlockTower, Framework Ventures, and GSR, who are aligned to utilize and grow the adoption of mTBILL and RWA assets that Midas issues on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>These partners plan to work in concert with Midas to create new opportunities within Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem by providing liquidity in protocols and creating new opportunities for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. We anticipate the activity will create a network effect within the Arbitrum ecosystem, contributing to its long-term growth and success.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"capital-preservation-accumulation-for-the-arbitrum-dao-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#capital-preservation-accumulation-for-the-arbitrum-dao-11\"></a><strong>Capital Preservation &amp; Accumulation for the Arbitrum DAO</strong></h4>\n<p>The investment from the Arbitrum DAO into tokenized treasuries such as Midas mTBILL safeguards the foundation’s financial stability and fosters growth, while also playing a pivotal role in advancing the real-world asset (RWA) ecosystem on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>By leveraging mTBILL, which utilises strategies akin to corporate treasury management, the foundation can diversify its assets and achieve stable financial returns without compromising liquidity or incurring high risk. Simultaneously, this investment enhances the security and stability of the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting its development and resilience against market volatility by integrating real-world financial mechanisms into the blockchain environment.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Arbitrum stands to gain from Midas’s robust legal and regulatory framework used to issue mTBILL, details of which we will explore later in this proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Has your entity or its officers/key contributors been subject to enforcement action, criminal action, or defaulted on legal or financial obligations?</strong></p>\n<p>No. None of our team members has any history of enforcement or legal actions against them. Transparency and adherence to regulatory standards are paramount, especially when dealing with a regulated securities issuance.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Describe any conflicts of interest for your entity and key personnel.</strong></p>\n<p>No conflicts of interest exist, for the entity or key personnel, at present.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Insurance coverages, guarantees, and backstops</strong></p>\n<p>mTBILL has a bankruptcy-protected structure.

During her tenure at Aave Companies, Alex was instrumental in setting resilient DeFi risk standards that endured extreme market conditions. Alongside the Genesis team, she forged one of the most active DAOs and largest liquidity pools in the DeFi space. After helping to propel the protocol’s growth, Alex supported its consolidation, developing a risk management framework covering tracking, alerting, and mitigations.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What are your entity’s current assets under management, assets held in trust, total value locked, or equivalent metric for your legal structuring?</strong></p>\n<p>The current Midas Total value locked (AUM) is USD 7.87m and recently closed on a USD 8.75m funding round co-led by BlockTower, Framework Ventures, and HV Capital.</p>\n<p>More information on our funding round and partners can be found via this link: <a href=\"https://midas.app/blog/midas-raises-8-75-million-funding-round-led-by-framework-ventures-blocktower-and-hv-capital\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Midas</a></p>\n<p><strong>11. How many of these assets held are present on Arbitrum One, if any?</strong></p>\n<p>None at present, but we intend to deploy on Arbitrum natively, growing mTBILL’s TVL and fostering ecosystem adoption within Arbitrum expected by the end of Q3.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"plan-design-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#plan-design-13\"></a>Plan design</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed product, Midas mTBILL, is a regulatory-compliant security token that offers investors on-chain exposure to yield from US Treasury Bills (T-Bills), specifically through the iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF managed by BlackRock. This ETF is comprised of short-dated US Treasury Bills, targeting a maturity mix of 0-1 year to minimize interest rate risk while providing a stable return.</p>\n<p>Given that US T-Bills are backed by the credit of the United States government, the credit quality of the underlying assets is among the highest. The product is designed to 1:1 track the performance of its underlying assets, offering both safety and yield onchain.</p>\n<p>Relevant attachments are included via email.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor, or similar rights?</strong></p>\n<p>mTBILL is a placement of a secured credit by the issuing SPV Midas Software GmbH.</p>\n<p>Investors in mTBILL gain exposure to the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying ETF, ensuring a claim to the financial returns generated from the US Treasury Bills. No shareholder or voting rights are associated with mTBILL.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>Midas mTBILL is issued under German law by Midas Software GmbH, structured as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to ensure compliance with the European Securities Regulation and Anti-Money Laundering law. Midas mTBILL is a secured loan issued by Midas Software GmbH to investors during token issuance. The asset tracks the value of the underlying Blackrock iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF (IB01).</p>\n<p>This setup adheres to regulations in multiple jurisdictions, with specific exclusions for US, China, sanctioned countries, and UK retail investors.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third-party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Arbitrum’s assets invested in mTBILL are bankruptcy remote due to the legal and contractual design involving an SPV (Midas Software GmbH) and the secure custody of assets by regulated custodians (e.g., Maerki Baumann).</p>\n<p>A security agent (e.g., ATG Azimut Treuhandgesellschaft mbH) acts on behalf of investors to ensure the segregation and protection of assets. This structure is established under German and Swiss law, providing a strong legal basis for asset protection against bankruptcy or adverse events affecting Midas.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The fund shares backing mTBILL are securely ring-fenced and held by a qualified custodian, assuring asset protection in the unlikely event of Midas’ insolvency.</li>\n<li>Assets are held in a segregated brokerage account protected from the custodian’s solvency. Maerki Baumann serves as the licensed Custodian of the assets.</li>\n<li>The appointed security agent acts as trustee to token holders ensuring bankruptcy remoteness. ATG Azimut Treuhandgesellschaft mbH acts as the Security Agent on behalf of investors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>No, not at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a detailed cash flow diagram that shows the flow of funds from ARB/Fiat conversion, investment in the underlying asset, payment of expenses, sale of the underlying asset, and repayment (Fiat/ARB conversion), including the counterparties and legal jurisdictions involved.</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4a1119ee393490f440cb16a1ac23d28aaed70bd8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/azdYgZ7ZPwvSbHbZsZjhkk2QDQA.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4a1119ee393490f440cb16a1ac23d28aaed70bd8.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"azdYgZ7ZPwvSbHbZsZjhkk2QDQA\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"641\" height=\"500\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F7F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"outline-flow-of-funds-with-reference-to-fees-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#outline-flow-of-funds-with-reference-to-fees-14\"></a><strong>Outline flow of funds (with reference to fees):</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Midas Software GmbH is the tokenizing entity where assets are ring-fenced and bankruptcy-protected.</li>\n<li>The security agent ATG Treuhand controls assets for Midas Software GmbH and can liquidate and distribute assets at the behest of the investors in the case of a default of the issuing SPV Midas Software GmbH.</li>\n<li>Midas Software GmbH receives investment in the form of fiat or stablecoins from the Arbitrum DAO.\n<ol>\n<li>If stablecoins aside from USDC are transferred, a qualified on-offramp provider converts the funds to USDC before transferring them to Maerki Baumann who then converts the proceeds to fiat.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>After converting to fiat, Maerki utilises the proceeds to acquire and hold BlackRock-managed US Treasury ETFs.</li>\n<li>Upon completion of the underlying purchase, a value-equivalent quantity of mTBILL is minted and sent to the investor’s wallet.\n<ol>\n<li>In the case of a redemption, Maerki sells a value-equivalent quantity of ETF shares.

Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>While the Arbitrum funding provided invaluable support that helped propagate our game, there was a lack of on-chain metrics in terms compared to other protocols due to the off-chain nature of our game. Tales of Elleria is now enhancing on-chain metrics to convert off-chain players to on-chain activity. We’ve now added mechanics to distribute rewards, incentives, and other tokens on-chain, and forcibly made players interact with Arbitrum to access these rewards so we have more representative on-chain metrics to show in the future.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while the Arbitrum funding provided invaluable support, we realized that we needed to create content and other retention mechanics after our two big game partners, DeFi Kingdoms and Spellborne, brought about a wave of new players, to fully capitalize on our growth. Tales of Elleria strategically enriched its content offerings to enhance player retention and achieved a whopping 91% monthly retention ratio the month after STIP.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7.

This combination of financial backing, proactive content creation, and partnered project support proved to be a winning formula, resulting in significant achievements for our project.</p>\n<p>Throughout the grant period, we witnessed remarkable strides forward. Notably, our collaborative events with DeFi Kingdoms and Spellborne garnered outstanding success. These partnerships not only expanded our reach but also retained users. The tangible outcomes, including substantial increases in player count, transaction count, and fee generation, underscore the effectiveness of the grant in driving our project’s success. As we reflect on these achievements, we’re inspired to continue our growth of Tales of Elleria.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tales-of-elleria-program-update/23633\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tales-of-elleria-program-update/23633","pubDate":"Fri, 03 May 2024 15:02:44 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23633"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tales-of-elleria-program-update/23633.rss","#text":"Tales of Elleria Program Update"},"filter":true},{"title":"Delegate Incentive Program Results (APRIL 2024)","dc:creator":"SEEDGov","category":"Delegate Incentives Program","description":"<p>We are proud to announce the initial outcomes of the second month of the Delegate Incentive Program.

While they naturally slightly slowed down during the weeks after the end of the incentives, all remain strong and very significantly higher than pre-stip numbers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1842d5d211364d627b6f79778bc43ec73ce166a9.png\" alt=\"tvl\" data-base62-sha1=\"3sCEuBW1RmXwDkPYFxMS3zIsw3L\" width=\"685\" height=\"424\"></p>\n<p>While some LPs probably left at the end of the STIP, a large part of the TVL decrease is related to ETH price action (most of our pairs being ETH-based), and a reaction to the recent market events in general. Camelot’s TVL was 60m pre-STIP, and is now sitting at ~100m after having reached ~140m during the STIP when ETH peaked at $4k.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9556abf8b576f6d17d3343169d20942f6a35d34c.png\" alt=\"volume\" data-base62-sha1=\"lj6PRu1dq1aNflvsgKyd6rXI51a\" width=\"685\" height=\"424\"></p>\n<p>Volume has been a perfect illustration of the success of that campaign, peaking at 3.4b in March, and maintained at 2.8b in April.

We believe that, in most cases, it’s essential to combine it with fees to correctly assess its true value. Fees followed exactly the same curve, peaking at 4.32m in March, and holding steady at 3.63m in April.</p>\n<p>In other words, volume has never been generated by aggressively lowering fees, but rather by an adapted incentives approach and a strategy that prioritizes LP returns. This allowed us to maintain strong natural returns for LPs, rather than betting everything on short-term incentives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8bdabcbd2840c2788ac1013b2fd140db5417ef7c.png\" alt=\"users\" data-base62-sha1=\"jXd0Fz8Ji4n81CeoOtSZCRbT900\" width=\"685\" height=\"467\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/81eb079fae3d16bc7bba97df3ad7b9500c3f6db5.png\" alt=\"trades\" data-base62-sha1=\"ixj8QqdvpNO2NdV7PPAwYvrSOMJ\" width=\"686\" height=\"472\"></p>\n<p>Users and trades followed almost the same curves as other metrics.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"focus-on-protocols-and-ecosystem-growth-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#focus-on-protocols-and-ecosystem-growth-8\"></a>FOCUS ON PROTOCOLS AND ECOSYSTEM GROWTH</h4>\n<p>During the STIP we incentivized more than 75 different pools from various ARB protocols.</p>\n<p>Contrary to a strategy focusing exclusively on TVL/volume/fees generation by prioritizing core and bluechip pairs, we chose an ecosystem-focused approach including many of our partners, a mix of Arbitrum OGs, smaller protocols, newcomers, and established projects from other ecosystems.</p>\n<p>With those pools, rather than targeting high volume/fees returns, our intent was to highlight those protocols and give them more exposure to Camelot and the wider Arbitrum community. Those additional yields were a perfect opportunity for many users to discover protocols they hadn’t heard of and give them a try.</p>\n<p>The STIP also allowed us to help many protocols to migrate their liquidity from v2 to v3, with those additional incentives helping them jumpstart their new CL pools – bringing a lot more capital efficiency and returns to their liquidity.</p>\n<p>Finally, more than 15 protocols (Peapods, Yak, Apex, Polytrade, etc…) used the STIP as an opportunity to facilitate their migration/expansion to Arbitrum by seeding their liquidity on Camelot – which naturally means onboarding their users from other chains to Arbitrum too.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"incentives-methodology-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentives-methodology-9\"></a>INCENTIVES METHODOLOGY</h4>\n<p>The choice of 15-days epochs gave us the possibility to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>efficiently readjust our allocations when needed</li>\n<li>experiment more freely, knowing we could easily revert</li>\n<li>quickly onboard new Arbitrum protocols</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key part to understand our approach is that the STIP ARB was actually not a large part of our biggest pairs APRs. For any pool able to generate volume, we’ve always prioritized sustainable liquidity first, i.e. that is naturally incentivized by the fees it generates.</p>\n<p>While aggressively cutting fees can sometimes be seen as an easy way to bring more volume, it actually ends up penalizing both LPs by lowering their returns, and ultimately dexes too, as the only remaining compensation for providers become emissions (whether it’s ARB or their own token).<br>\nThe power of CL is to actually allow to compensate IL through the pools’ natural fees, which is the only way to properly maintain and scale liquidity in the long run.</p>\n<p>We hence chose to apply to our ARB distribution the same logic we used for our own GRAIL emissions, which allowed us to save millions of dollars in 18 months, compared to what was initially planned (cf. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CamelotDEX/status/1779117212441223536\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/CamelotDEX/status/1779117212441223536</a>).</p>\n<p>This can be easily illustrated by comparing some of the generated fees vs spent incentives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>February 24, our weakest STIP month: <strong>2.58m of fees for 1.2m of incentives spent</strong> (ARB + GRAIL)</li>\n<li>March 24, our strongest STIP month: <strong>4.32m of fees for 1m of incentives spent</strong> (ARB + GRAIL)</li>\n<li>April 24, post-STIP: <strong>3.63m of fees for 500k of incentives spent</strong> (GRAIL only)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To summarize, our approach has been to focus on the fees generation while keeping incentives as low and sustainable as possible, always with a long term approach in mind, which we think is relatively unique in the dex space.<br>\nWe strongly believe that this strategy enables us to exploit these additional ARB incentives in the most efficient way, while ensuring that the newly-attracted liquidity is retained even once those incentives are exhausted.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-10\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"h-6-how-much-are-you-requesting-for-this-stip-bridge-proposal-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-6-how-much-are-you-requesting-for-this-stip-bridge-proposal-11\"></a>6.

[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>Even if the program allowed us to grow (1) the Angle TVL on Arbitrum with peak 1753% increase now stabilizing at a 538% increased compared to the begining of the program, and (2) DEX liquidity, the remaining stEUR holders after the program did not necessarily leave their liquidity in the pools created, they keep holding the EURA and stEUR stablecoins but out the pools.  In summary, new holders of the EURA stablecoin remained after the end of the program and a considerable part of them (approx. 50%) kept staking their EURA stablecoin into stEUR to gain the RWA yield associated with it. Indeed Around 1m of EURA are currently staked in the stEUR savings product. However, most of these people pulled their liquidity out the Camelot pools that were set up.</p>\n<p>The integration of stEUR with Silo allowed the onboarding of new EURA and stEUR holders. Integrations and sigle-sided liquidity incentivization on Silo appears to be a good continuation path for this STIP Bridge.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7.

[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>Angle has launched a new USD stablecoin, USDA. USDA has a yield-bearing product associated called stUSD.</p>\n<p>The reserves backing USDA and stUSD are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Price Stability Module</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SteakUSDC: the USDC deposits in the Steakhouse Financial curated Morpho vault, yielding the current DeFi money markets yield (64.70%)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/en/products/307243/ishares-treasury-bond-0-1yr-ucits-etf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">IB01</a>: Blackrock ETF of short term US treasury bonds tokenized by <a href=\"https://backed.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Backed Finance</a> (18%)</li>\n<li>USDC: the Circle USD stablecoin (17.30%)</li>\n<li>USDA also has a safety surplus of $3M+ to further buffer overcollateralization, and this surplus is called to grow as the protocol grows. This surplus buffer is made up of the profits the protocol has built since its launch in November 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Borrowing Facility on Morpho</strong>: For USDA, Angle delegated its borrowing facility to a Metamorpho vault curated by Gauntlet by pre-minting USDA in it. This is functionally equivalent to having a borrowing system on its own. The choice to delegate the borrowing infrastructure of USDA to the Morpho system holds benefits in terms of distribution, helps to benefit from the expertise of a reputed third party as Gauntlet and still allows the protocol to manage its risk on Morpho by proposing to adjust debt ceilings. To this date, the protocol has minted $3M USDA in the form of Automatic Market Operations (AMO) for seeding purposes in the Morpho vault curated by Gauntlet. This is always trackable in <a href=\"https://analytics.angle.money/collaterals\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the real-time analytics and balance sheet </a> provided by Angle.

This is also always trackable in <a href=\"https://analytics.angle.money/collaterals\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the real-time analytics and balance sheet </a> provided by Angle. Please also see the <a href=\"https://gov.angle.money/t/aip-89-seed-a-eura-usda-liquidity-pool/827\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">governance proposal</a> relating to the seeding of that pool and and how this reflects within the balance sheet and the <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/side-modules/amo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Angle documentation</a> explaining protocol AMOs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For stUSD, the yield comes from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assets held in the backing (price stability module)\n<ul>\n<li>steakUSDC currently yielding 7% depending on DeFi rates</li>\n<li>b<a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/en/products/307243/ishares-treasury-bond-0-1yr-ucits-etf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">IB01</a>: Blackrock ETF of short term US treasury bonds tokenized by <a href=\"https://backed.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Backed Finance</a> yielding approximately 5% over the past year</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Borrowing interest earned by the protocol from people borrowing USDA on Angle Morpho Blue markets</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently stUSD yields 20%. <strong>Why is it the the yield so high?</strong> The current yield is at 20% for stUSD thanks to the multiplier effect that Angle’s savings solution benefits from. The yield that the protocol distributes to stUSD holders comes from the backing of USDA. Currently, only 27% of the USDA is staked into stUSD, this means that the savings contract utilization rate is low and it allows stUSD holders to earn more. <strong>Why is the utilization rate low?</strong> The current utilization rates on the stUSD and stEUR are low due to competing DeFi integrations that incentivize USDA and EURA holders to deposit their stablecoins in pools rather than staking them with Angle. For example, USDA supply is largely used on Aerodrome (Base Chain DEX) and Morpho rather than being staked.</p>\n<p>A larger target and user base that the Euro stablecoin: USDA has been launched two weeks ago and currently has a 10m TVL. More generally, USD stablecoins have larger use cases and adoption in Defi, hence the plan to direct the potential STIP bridge funds to the development of use cases around USDA and stUSD.</p>\n<p>After the initial STIP program, an event if Angle registered solid growth numbers in user count, volume, and TVL, it appears that favoring lending and/or perpetual DEX inregrations may be better long term spending for networks effects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The new plan would be to allocate the funds as follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step 1 - 250,000 ARB dedicated to single sided USDA liquidity providers on lending markets including at least Silo,</li>\n<li>Step 2 - 100,000 ARB dedicated to (1) bringing stUSD liquidity on a native perpetual DEX on Arbitrum (Vela Exchange or else) to facilitate more trades, or (2) bringing furthermore USDA liquidity a money market on results observed in Step 1</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incentives distributions on Silo</strong><br>\nAngle will gradually distribute incentives on Silo starting with a lower amount of incentives during the first weeks to avoid incentives collection by a minority of lenders. Incentives will be streamed on a weekly basis in order to monitor and maintain a constant APR.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentives distributions on a perpetual DEX</strong><br>\nThe goal would be to facilitate more trades by bringing further liquidity on a native decentralized Arbitrum perpetual DEX. The incentives would be distributed to reward the liquidity deposited. If implemented, this distribution of ARB will be rolled out progressively to ensure a constant and controlled APR benefiting to a maximum of LPs.</p>\n<p><strong>10.

[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>During the STIP, we decided to repurpose 100k set aside for partnerships to extend out the juiced vaults for another month. We were not able to find a proper set of partners that were capable to deploy options liquidity mining given the time constraints and resource requirement from the receiving team. If we had to do it again, we would get some commitment prior to the STIP period to lock-in the partnerships. However, given the amount of new projects moving over with LTIPP, it’s doubtful we will run into that problem again.<br>\nWe were also able to develop some new vault types we have not deployed yet as well as a new algo strategy that a few groups are interested in utilizing that should result in some newer exotic options vaults for tokens that do not have a mature spot market yet, which we are excited to deploy soon. We started the cross protocol initiatives to move over liquidity from other chains (SOL) and soon (OP) and with more to come, however the we kind of stink at doing the cross-protocol marketing and end up releasing piecemeal, we could definitely do a better job coordinating between project teams. So if STIP Bridge does get over the line, the items addressed here are what we would course correct this time around to continue to develop our relationships with other projects across the ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a name=\"vaults-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vaults-3\"></a>Vaults</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>During the STIP, the vaults had an 80% utilization rate. As you dig deeper the majors tokens of ETH and ARB were constantly at 90% utilization throughout the STIP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a name=\"traders-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#traders-4\"></a>Traders</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>During and immediately following the STIP, Premia experienced an exponential growth in volume. This was due to the combination of orderbook liquidity coming online, algorithmic traders integrating into our platform, and deep liquidity in the vaults.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-5\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h1>\n<p><strong>7. How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>420,000 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><em>8. Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways</em> as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal? [Y/N]</em>*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>9. [Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning from the previous period, we plan on keeping the allocation percentages largely similar. However, regarding execution, we plan to incorporate different ecosystem tools to boost engagement and reach parties outside of the de facto Options Community. Note that during the STIP, we decided to repurpose 100k set aside for Options Liquidity Mining partnerships to extend out the juiced vaults for another month, as we were not able to find a proper set of partners that were capable to deploy OLM given the time constraints and resource requirement from the receiving team. Given this, we will only incentivize Vaults and Traders this time around.</li>\n<li>The new split will focus on incentivizing foundational desired behavior. This will include incentive programs for makers &amp; takers, vault participants, and project archetype users. The breakdown is as follows\n<ul>\n<li><strong>280,000 Arbitrum tokens allocated to incentivizing vault participants (6/9 as before)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This will allow for more option writing. We will target 6mm in new Liquidity into the vaults</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>140,000 Arbitrum tokens allocated to incentivize makers and takers (3/9)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>With the recent success of trading programs by vertex and dydx we plan to replicate a similar program. They have shown a proven path to attract new traders and increase volume in a healthy and manageable manner.</li>\n<li>Moreover these incentives will help support the soon to launch project archetype. Users will benefit directly from incentivizing takers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Additionally we will be partnering with ecosystem tooling to track engagement and reach parties outside of the de facto options Community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10. Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0xa079C6B032133b95Cf8b3d273D27eeb6B110a469\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Safe{Wallet} – Dashboard</a></li>\n<li>The multi-sig is already in place and the vault contracts will be provided upon deployment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>11. Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall, the experience was very positive and led to a lot of growth in the protocol that we believe can springboard Premia’s further usage.</li>\n<li>Regarding pain points, we did have some lessons to learn regarding allocating for partnerships, described in more detail in item 6 - and this was something on our end that we’re already prepared to correct.</li>\n<li>Juiced emissions are nice for legitimacy scoring (TVL) and vanity metrics - foundational incentivization of desired behavior is where we are starting to reap what we sowed. It all plays into the cycle; higher TVL brings more eyes and rapport, and gets you into conversations</li>\n<li>with participants that can make time and resource investments to make your Defi protocol a success.</li>\n<li><strong>The ultimate goal we planned on solving with STIP rewards (the cold start problem), was knocked out of the park!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"future-plans-for-the-product-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#future-plans-for-the-product-6\"></a>Future Plans for the product</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>We are currently working on what we call Project Archetype. It will be an AA-first defi platform (that uses Premia under the hood) aimed at growing options adoption and defi more broadly by streamlining opinionated defi experiences. It will feature a first-of-its-kind ‘price protection’ feature utilizing options and smart account wallets for smoother onboarding of new users. We are planning to have this ready during the STIP bridge period this summer, and like Premia will be Arbitrum exclusive.</li>\n<li>We are working on a portfolio margin solution. Over the past 6 months the premia team has talked to current users and potential users about the limitations and struggles in the onchain options ecosystem. The universal theme among all conversations has been the need for capital efficiency. Our goal now is to create that capital efficient system with the introduction of portfolio margin. Allowing us to solve the biggest technical and economic limitation in the onchain options ecosystem.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a class=\"hashtag-cooked\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/stip-bridge-addendum/29\" data-type=\"category\" data-slug=\"stip-bridge-addendum\" data-id=\"29\" data-ref=\"dao-grant-programs:stip-bridge-addendum\"><span class=\"hashtag-icon-placeholder\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-square-full svg-icon svg-node\"><use href=\"#square-full\"></use></svg></span><span>STIP Bridge Addendum</span></a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-7\"></a></h1>\n<p>*Credit to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3\">@dk3</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/caesar\">@Caesar</a> as well as Lynch from the Premia Parliament for assisting with this STIP Addendum, and to our advisor Atomist from Castle Capital.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/premia-stip-addendum/23625\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/premia-stip-addendum/23625","pubDate":"Thu, 02 May 2024 20:53:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23625"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/premia-stip-addendum/23625.rss","#text":"[Premia] STIP Addendum"},"filter":false},{"title":"Arbitrum Onboarding Working Group: Milestone 1 Status Update","dc:creator":"RikaGoldberg","category":"Governance","description":"<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>\n<p>We are one-third of the way through with the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-onboarding-working-group-experiment/22849\">Arbitrum Onboarding Working Group Experiment</a>.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</h3>\n<p>TrueFi tfBILL helps Arbitrum to achieve its objectives of managing treasury into high-quality, highly liquid assets by providing on-chain access to short-term U.S. Treasury Bill yields.</p>\n<p>Through STEP, Arbitrum and TrueFi can establish a model for successful investment of DAO treasury into “real world assets” using a crypto-native stack that integrates processes of leading off-chain asset managers (Adapt3r Digital) into open, on-chain financial infrastructure (TrueFi).</p>\n<p>As the RWA ecosystem evolves, TrueFi is positioned to facilitate additional RWA activity beyond tokenized T-bills. TrueFi has originated nearly $2B in onchain credit to date (source: <a href=\"http://rwa.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">rwa.xyz</a>), and built generalized credit infrastructure that suits our needs as the asset manager of tfBILL.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic Compliance and Regulatory Leadership</strong></p>\n<p>Consistent with our belief that a tokenized asset is only as strong as the regulatory compliance of its issuer, Adapt3r Digital has crafted tfBILL with a foundational emphasis on compliance. We aim to set the gold standard within the DeFi space for regulatory adherence. This approach not only aligns with stringent financial regulations that come with being a US-domiciled asset manager, but also the investor protections that come with a Professional Mutual Fund registered with the BVI Financial Services Commission. Adapt3r has taken a measured approach to integrations to date, focusing on KYC’d and permissioned ecosystems. By adhering strictly and conservatively to global securities regulation, tfBILL is best positioned to scale with the growth of Arbitrum without interruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Commitment to Decentralization</strong></p>\n<p>With the launch of tfBILL, Adapt3r Digital leverages the TrueFi protocol’s proven track record of nearly $2 billion in loan volume, which is by far the highest volume as well as one of the longest-lasting RWA ecosystems in DeFi. Consistent with Arbitrum’s vision, TrueFi is the only RWA platform managed exclusively by a decentralized community. The integration of tfBILL on Arbitrum also brings TrueFi’s core private credit marketplace, which is relaunching <a href=\"https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-11-rebuilding-a-risk-managed-crypto-native-lending-vertical-on-truefi/1602\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">professionally underwritten pools</a>, as well as a soon-to-debut <a href=\"https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-12-truefi-trinity-a-new-vision-and-roadmap/1620\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">treasury-backed stablecoin </a>to every user in the Arbitrum ecosystem. By offering an entire ecosystem rather than a single asset, TrueFi’s tfBILL is a logical choice for growing Arbitrum without compromising on quality or overall mission of the endowment.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasury Diversification and Composability</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the immediate benefit of investing in US treasury bills, the most liquid and low risk asset globally, the broader TrueFi ecosystem also offers Arbitrum’s treasury a strategic diversification option by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@cicadapartners/cicada-partners-secures-approval-from-truefi-dao-to-serve-as-credit-risk-manager-4d1e3b81fba8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">providing access to alternative credit products</a>, which contain higher yielding opportunities with established managers. This diversification allows the treasury to tap into an alternative asset class that is not only stable and profitable but also managed through robust risk controls and compliance measures, enhancing the overall security and yield potential of treasury assets.</p>\n<p>For more information on the general benefits of tfBILL, please see <a href=\"https://docs.adapt3r.com/adapt3r-digital-docs/qualified-access-products/adapt3r-short-term-us-treasury-fund/us-treasury-bill-yield-now-on-chain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our docs</a> and also find TrueFi docs <a href=\"https://docs.truefi.io/faq\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-6\"></a>2.

Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</h3>\n<p>Our risk management, across both operations and investment activity, centers on the simplicity of our investment approach and product structuring. This simplicity is by design – we believe that complexity breeds fragility.</p>\n<p>tfBILL was built in response to compliance and complexity concerns we continually heard from DAOs and on-chain investors about existing treasury bill offerings. Specifically, many DeFi entities and users expressed difficulty evaluating existing options due to contrived and opaque legal structures with uncertain investor recourse, hidden layers of fees, and aggressive operation in regulatory grey areas.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning, our primary goal has been to build an on-chain treasury instrument that is simple, transparent, and secure for all users.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational Risk Management</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s operations are safeguarded by robust internal controls, including consensus-based approval mechanisms and role-based governance protocols.</p>\n<p>For example, by limiting disbursement of funds from the contract to <a href=\"https://github.com/TrueFi-Protocol/contracts-fluorine/blob/main/docs/interfaces/IStructuredAssetVault.md#disburse-1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>onlyAllowedBorrowers</code></a> that are assigned the <code>BORROWER_ROLE</code> by TrueFi governance, tfBILL can ensure that USDC can only be disbursed to approved addresses at Coinbase Prime.</p>\n<p>These measures are bolstered by multi-layered physical and digital security protections. On-chain assets are safeguarded by multi-sig operations and leading custodial providers. Off-chain assets are held in custody with a regulated institutional custodian and a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer.</p>\n<p>Our operational controls are supported by technology solutions including real-time monitoring and alerts, ensuring that any unauthorized access or deviations from established procedures are quickly identified and addressed. Additionally, we engage a reputable fund administrator to oversee daily Net Asset Value calculations as well as an AML Reportig Officer to enforce meticulous KYC, KYB, and AML protocols, further reinforcing our commitment to regulatory compliance and operational integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Investment Risk Management</strong></p>\n<p>The cornerstone of our Investment Risk Management centers ADAPT I LP focuses on maintaining a conservative and strategic approach to portfolio management, investing only in short-term U.S. Treasury bills. Our investment strategy employs a ladder approach by diversifying across different maturities to effectively manage duration and liquidity risks.</p>\n<p>This strategy is supplemented by active internal reviews and monitoring, ensuring alignment with our risk appetite and investment goals. We also conduct extensive research and leverage independent expertise to inform our investment decisions, ensuring that each investment is well-positioned to meet our stringent criteria for risk and return.</p>\n<p>By maintaining rigorous operational controls and a prudent investment strategy, we ensure the safety and performance of our fund.

How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</h3>\n<p><em>Trust-minimized:</em> Full transparency into flow of funds and real time on-chain monitoring. On-chain assets are segregated in cold storage and held by a Qualified Custodian. Off-chain assets are segregated and custodied by a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer. Investors can monitor the manager’s portfolio, yield generation, fees and expenses, and ongoing maturity profile in real-time. Streamlined investor reporting statements are provided by Archblock. Further, investors have real-time visibility of the off-chain U.S. Treasury Bills held by the manager as well as deposits and withdrawals to the Fund. The primary activity that requires trust from our investors is within the subscription/redemption process, whereby Adapt3r withdraws USDC to Coinbase Prime. Adapt3r controls the TrueFi Asset Vault using multi-sig technology, and access is limited to key management personnel. Every other aspect of the flow of funds is trustless and/or highly regulated.</p>\n<p><em>Audits &amp; Attestations:</em> Independent third-party fund administrator NAV Consulting releases daily NAV reports (which are available to investors on Archblock’s frontend), detailing the Net Asset Value of the backing tfBILL’s underlying holdings. ADAPT I LP is subject to annual audits, conducted by Wolf &amp; Company, a recognized fund auditor with deep experience in blockchain fund audit and accounting services. This ensures that ADAPT I LP maintains the highest accounting standards and third party oversight.</p>\n<p><em>Administrator:</em> NAV Fund Administration Group serves as the Administrator for the Fund. The Administrator provides certain accounting, operations and other administrative support for the Fund as preparing quarterly reports, calculating the Fund’s Net Asset Value, providing the registrar and transfer agency services in connection with the issuance and transfer of Interests, performing the required acts relating to the redemption and/or subscription for the Interests and performing certain other administrative and clerical services in connection with the administration of the Fund as agreed among the Fund and the Administrator.</p>\n<p><em>Custodian:</em> The Fund has appointed TradeStation Securities, Inc. as its custodian to custody the U.S. Treasury Bills and may have a separate custodian for the custody of USDC and other consideration paid by Limited Partners. Such custodians have developed security systems to maintain confidential access to private keys that have been generated and which control movement of the Tokens, as applicable. The Investment Manager may not be able to obtain control of the private keys generated by the exchanges utilized by the Fund, because each exchange may use different methodologies and security systems. The Investment Manager seeks to employ a comprehensive due diligence process to select custodians that it determines have developed sophisticated security systems and will continue to reevaluate the due diligence process and security systems of the various custodians.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-6-is-there-any-custom-logic-required-for-your-rwa-token-if-so-please-give-any-details-51\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-6-is-there-any-custom-logic-required-for-your-rwa-token-if-so-please-give-any-details-51\"></a>6.

Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>We found that the incentive campaign brought in many wash traders, where our intention was to promote real users. We will change the campaign in the bridge version to remove the risk of wash trading by targeting developers and adjusting the economics when targeting end users. This will be beneficial not only for the end user, but the developers and protocols that integrate our API/SDK as well. This is therefore not just a benefit for us, but also all the protocols that build with us in terms of lowering development costs, improved security, better incentives and economic models, and improving their product by offering more features and functions that would otherwise not be available.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7. How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>350,000 ARB</p>\n<p>(200,000ARB will be utilized for rewards for lending dashboard users, and 150k towards protocol rewards to users who utilize Protocolink, such as Radiant’s Unwind feature)</p>\n<p>8.Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>9.How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>It is our intention in this version to promote the use of Protocolink by our partners and developers. If a protocol or developer utilizes Protocolink API/SDK to route transactions, a portion of the overall volume will be incentivized and rewarded. This is different from our previous campaign because we will not only be incentivizing retail users, but builders as well. Therefore we will provide 150k rewards towards user incentives for protocols that route transactions through Protocolink.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, the first change we want to make is to include an incentive to builders who build using our public API/SDK. Protocolink, our API/SDK, is one of the most robust SDK’s in the industry today. Through the composability of Furucombo, Protocolink allows developers to take advantage of the functions and features available through Furucombo, such as advanced position management, zap in/out of lending positions, multi-send, and more. Additionally, by a developer or protocol utilizing Protocolink, we can significantly reduce the cost of development for developers, as well as reducing security risks. Through our studies, we have calculated that developers can save approximately 77% development costs by utilizing Protocolink for their Lending SDK needs. This can be demonstrated by our collaboration with Radiant protocol who is utilizing our API/SDK to unwind positions directly on their interface. These rewards will incentivize developers to utilize Protocolink so that they can provide rewards directly to their users through the integration. We believe that this can help to strengthen the developer community on Arbitrum and act as an incentive to develop more outstanding dapps to deploy on chain due to the developer friendly environment.</p>\n<p>The second change will be to focus on how we can avoid wash trades on Furucombo, and to promote real users. This began to happen once the $ARB token saw a big price swing and it was profitable to perform trades to earn tokens. We still want to provide incentives to users, but we noticed that a volume based approach for all functions on the Lending Dashboard caused the back and forth trades from occurring. Therefore we will focus again on the advanced features, such as Collateral Swaps, Debt Swaps, Leverage, and Deleverage. Additionally, we will adjust the rewards based on the token amount (instead of price), to target a specific percentage of rewards. Furthermore, we will provide users with gas incentives. Because of the complex transactions when performing position management, gas fees can vary anywhere from a few dollars to as high as over five dollars. By providing gas incentives, it will allow users to be able to manage their positions without having to worry about the cost of performing the transactions on the network. The plan will be to reduce the cost for position management to zero or slightly profitable, but not enough that we will attract wash traders. If we notice that the positive value is too high, we will adjust the rewards to compensate to control the back and forth trades. With these changes, we believe this will greatly reduce the back and forth swaps and will focus more attention on real users attempting to adjust their positions.</p>\n<p>The goals for this campaign will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>KPI 1 - Increase volume through the Protocolink API through our partner integrations (such as Radiant’s Unwind feature) by providing user incentives</li>\n<li>KPI 2 - Increase real volume on users doing position management advanced actions (collateral swap, debt swap, leverage, and deleverage)</li>\n<li>KPI 3 - Increase the amount of users that are able to use these functions (~50% increase, previously we seen a 57% increase)</li>\n<li>KPI 4 - Add more protocols that utilize the Protocolink API/SDK for transactions (&amp; provide incentives to those users)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final details will be determined upon the creation of this campaign including recommendations from the community and Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>10.Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisig Address\n<ul>\n<li>0x99D40438543041e3CC53ac1fE8FF2B8f68996C79</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>11.Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<p>Overall the experience was good. It would be nice to be able to assign incentives based on our own schedule, as opposed to staying static to an overall schedule. We believe that we could have run the previous round of rewards for a longer period of time, and therefore could have provided incentives for longer. Other than that, we really appreciate that Arbitrum is focusing on developer incentives and providing us the ability and opportunity to continue to build and provide the best possible experience for users for managing their positions, and performing transactions in DeFi.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-furucombo-stip-addendum/23599\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-furucombo-stip-addendum/23599","pubDate":"Thu, 02 May 2024 08:47:32 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23599"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-furucombo-stip-addendum/23599.rss","#text":"[FINAL] Furucombo STIP Addendum"},"filter":false},{"title":"Ondo Finance: Ondo I LP (OUSG) STEP Application","dc:creator":"Boulder17","category":"STEP Applications","description":"<p><strong>Applicant information</strong><br>\nName: Ondo I LP<br>\nAddress (Headquarters): 500 W Putnam Ave Ste 400<br>\nCity, State, Postal Code: Greenwich, CT, 06830-6096<br>\nCountry: US<br>\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://ondo.finance/ousg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OUSG | Ondo Finance</a></p>\n<p>Primary Contact<br>\nName: Katie Wheeler<br>\nTitle: VP of Partnerships<br>\nCountry: US<br>\nEmail: Katie.Wheeler@Ondo.Finance<br>\nTelegram: <span class=\"mention\">@Katie_Wheeler</span></p>\n<p>Key Information<br>\nExpected Yield: 4.96% APY as at 04/30/24</p>\n<p>Expected Maturity: OUSG does not have a maturity.
