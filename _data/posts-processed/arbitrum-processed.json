Each allocation is carefully crafted for maximum impact, always taking into account available co-incentive schemes and experimenting with different distribution methods and target APYs.</p>\n<p>The delay can be attributed to two factors:<br>\n(1) some ARB was earmarked for integrations with Silo, Spectra, and CreditGuild, which are only now ready to start. And additionally for a further integration with Aave GHO, who is requesting a similar <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-aave-dao-ltipp-grant-extension-request/26612\">extension</a>.</p>\n<p>(2) Similarly, in addition to the rollout of the yield-bearing version, sGYD, a dedicated staking infrastructure was developed that only went live last week.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Generally, the LTIPP grant has been a great success for Gyroscope. ARB is being used to incentivize the use of the GYD meta-stablecoin and to encourage the adoption of Gyroscope’s concentrated liquidity AMMs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gyroscope pools saw a large capital inflow. In the latest period from Aug-26-to-date, the average TVL of Gyroscope pools with ARB incentives was <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3923512\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">11m USD</a>.  Gyroscope’s TVL on Arbitrum grew from 1.48m to 16.7m <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3993279/6720961\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">over the course of LTIPP</a> so far.</li>\n<li>The stablecoin GYD has also seen a lot of adoption on Arbitrum due to ARB incentives. The newly launched yield-bearing version, sGYD, has 70% of its entire supply on Arbitrum, with the remaining 30% being on Ethereum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The remaining 19 675 ARB is planned to be used to bootstrap additional use-cases of sGYD on Arbitrum (via, for example, a Spectra yield-market), generally encourage (s)GYD adoption, and further incentivize Gyroscope AMMs that are coming to market now. Gyroscope plans to match incentives on Arbitrum after LTIPP through sGYD yield sharing mechanisms, SPIN points, and SPIN for Balancer incentive votes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant an extension on deadline to allocate remaining ARB from LTIPP Grant for Gyroscope to allocate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The extension will utilize the remaining ARB tokens from our original proposal for liquidity mining on Gyroscope.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-steps-to-implement-6\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The last, missing integrations with other Arbitrum DeFi participants are very close to being concluded.

With this lite report, we aim to provide a better understanding of how Gitcoin and Jokerace impact community engagement, drive growth, and generate lasting effects in the Arbitrum Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>These are our preliminary research findings, which will be expanded upon in subsequent deliveries. This report serves as the deliverable for Milestone 1.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-key-takeaways-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-key-takeaways-1\"></a>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arbitrum’s Dominance in Gitcoin Rounds:</strong> Arbitrum has positioned itself as the dominant network for Gitcoin rounds, with 87% of all rounds in Q2 2024 happening here. Making it the current preferred choice for funding and community engagement initiatives within the Gitcoin ecosystem, likely due to the Thrive-powered partnership between both ecosystems.</li>\n<li>Strong Donation Participation Despite Lower Averages: Although Thrive-powered Gitcoin rounds have a 63% lower average donation compared to non-Thrive rounds in Arbitrum, this is skewed by large outliers. Thrive rounds excel in generating consistent donations, with +50% more contributions at the 50th and 75th percentiles, indicating strong community engagement. Recommendation: Keep broad participation while exploring how to attract larger donations to further increase impact.</li>\n<li><strong>“Younger” Audience Engagement:</strong> Thrive-powered rounds attracted, on average, younger accounts to Gitcoin. Potentially indicating the onboarding of new users into the Gitcoin ecosystem. Recommendation: Continue to develop initiatives that generate new users, while also working towards the retention of these users as they mature in the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Participation Patterns in Gitcoin Rounds:</strong> Thrive-powered Gitcoin rounds show a “mid-participation period” spike in activity, unlike the general trend of being skewed toward the end of the round participation period. It would appear that Thrive-powered rounds are effective in engaging participants earlier in the process.</li>\n<li><strong>Jokerace’s Short-lived Success on Arbitrum:</strong> While Jokerace saw a peak in activity on Arbitrum during Thrive initiatives, this activity was not sustained and quickly shifted to other networks, mostly Base. This suggests that this activity was heavily dependent on activations, with limited sustained organic growth. Recommendation: Explore new ways of integrating Jokerace into the Arbitrum ecosystem to make its use more organic rather than Thrive-driven.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Reach of Thrive-Powered Jokerace Contests:</strong> Thrive-powered contests on Jokerace achieved significant social media reach, particularly on Twitter/X, almost hitting 100K users. However, this reach was concentrated in a few key participants. Recommendation: Explore new strategies to get more Key Opinion Leaders, or incentivize broader sharing to reduce the reliance on a few key players.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-current-limitations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-current-limitations-2\"></a>Current Limitations</h3>\n<p>This analysis offers preliminary conclusions. Data analyzed for this report is limited to the end of Q2 2024 when the initiatives ended. Jokerace data has been decoded as much as possible and reflects an accurate approximation of reality, however only the listed chains have been taken into account.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57592-gitcoin-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-gitcoin-3\"></a>Gitcoin</h2>\n<p>We focused our analysis on 3 main areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Impact of the Arbitrum-Gitcoin partnership in the context of the pluralistic grants framework.</li>\n<li>Characteristics of Gitcoin Rounds in Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Characteristics of users engaging with Gitcoin Rounds in Arbitrum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-gitcoin-activity-by-network-arbitrum-is-king-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-gitcoin-activity-by-network-arbitrum-is-king-4\"></a>Gitcoin Activity by Network, Arbitrum is King</h3>\n<p>Gitcoin has been one of the preferred bounties platforms in the EVM ecosystem. Under the Pluralistic Grants Framework, Gitcoin was used as a channel to spur growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, facilitating contributions to open-source projects and generating exposure to a vast community of dedicated developers.</p>\n<p>If we take a look at the distribution of Gitcoin Rounds based on the network they were run on, we can see the dominance of Arbitrum as the network to run the rounds, 87% of the rounds in Q2 2024 were executed in Arbitrum. This aligns with campaigns executed by Thrive in Gitcoin.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b298f0d44810929c37858857171d0c029686a265.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ptWF9v9GVwPRibBSsptJEAIlMr3.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b298f0d44810929c37858857171d0c029686a265_2_620x347.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ptWF9v9GVwPRibBSsptJEAIlMr3\" width=\"620\" height=\"347\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b298f0d44810929c37858857171d0c029686a265_2_620x347.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b298f0d44810929c37858857171d0c029686a265_2_930x520.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b298f0d44810929c37858857171d0c029686a265_2_1240x694.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"224D5F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Although all-time data shows a decrease in Gitcoin rounds since Q4 2021, likely aligned with the sentiment at the macro-level and the onset of the current bear market.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e61b34fd8e686cca501ef57ff11750e688a37691.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wPC6KGrUoPVqPREYeQ9U2niGf3H.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e61b34fd8e686cca501ef57ff11750e688a37691_2_624x349.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"wPC6KGrUoPVqPREYeQ9U2niGf3H\" width=\"624\" height=\"349\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e61b34fd8e686cca501ef57ff11750e688a37691_2_624x349.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e61b34fd8e686cca501ef57ff11750e688a37691_2_936x523.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e61b34fd8e686cca501ef57ff11750e688a37691_2_1248x698.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"26282F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-gitcoin-rounds-on-arbitrum-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-gitcoin-rounds-on-arbitrum-5\"></a>Gitcoin Rounds on Arbitrum</h3>\n<p>Anlalyzing Gitcoin activity on Arbitrum reveals that USD $235,000 were donated during the period analyzed. Of this, only 22% is directly tied to Thrive initiatives, with the remaining 78% corresponding to non-Thrive related rounds.</p>\n<p>Focusing on Thrive related rounds, we observe smaller donation amounts, averaging $2.12 (with 75% of the donations below $1.16). In comparison, non-Thrive rounds had an average donation 63% higher, around $3.46 (with 75% of the donations below $2).</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rounds</th>\n<th>Thrive</th>\n<th>non-Thrive</th>\n<th>Delta</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Total Donations</td>\n<td>$52,911.00</td>\n<td>$182,743.00</td>\n<td>245%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avg.

However, looking at the 50th and 75th percentile - representing how many donations at least 50%/75% of the projects receive - we see that Thrive is outperforming the other gitcoin rounds significantly by over 50. This suggests that Thrive created very homogenous rounds with consistently high donation counts, aligning with Gitcoin’s foundational principles.</p>\n<p>In terms of participation, Thrive rounds showed a somewhat even distribution among the top 30 projects (between 400 and 500 donations). Total donation amounts display a different distribution, evidencing a noticeable gap between the top 3 projects and the runner-ups.</p>\n<p>It is worth to note that the Arbitrum DAO Delegates project received the highest donation count overall, totalling over 1.2k donations, and ranked 3rd in terms of total donation amounts</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hosMFfzrsWCnqocfEEeLsOfEv5h.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hosMFfzrsWCnqocfEEeLsOfEv5h\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_690x386.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"173539\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pIHM7DzR1QaeO2ywgfM11dsECZN.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"pIHM7DzR1QaeO2ywgfM11dsECZN\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_690x386.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"172F33\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-which-users-are-engaging-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-which-users-are-engaging-6\"></a>Which Users Are Engaging?</h3>\n<p>If we take a look at the the users participating in the rounds executed during the analyzed time range, we can see that Thrive-related Rounds appeal to a “younger” audience, compared to non-Thrive rounds in Arbitrum.

The Foundation introduced 5 Grant Tracks that projects can choose from based on their development stage, growth projection and type of project. The 5 tracks are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Growth Track:</strong> For projects showing early signs of traction and aim to launch on the Arbitrum (One or Nova) mainnet soon.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Growth Track:</strong> For projects with proven momentum looking to amplify their growth on Arbitrum (One or Nova).</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Chain Track:</strong> For projects with proven momentum on another blockchain, but keen to integrate with Arbitrum.</li>\n<li><strong>Orbit Track:</strong> For projects building innovative app chains, rollups and rollup infrastructure on Orbit.</li>\n<li><strong>Stylus Track:</strong> For innovative projects like (but not limited to) math-heavy finance algorithms, onchain generative art or complex cryptography on Stylus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57468-strategic-partnerships-and-growth-initiatives-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57468-strategic-partnerships-and-growth-initiatives-5\"></a>Strategic Partnerships and Growth Initiatives</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Solidifying Arbitrum as a robust platform for DeFi:</strong> The Foundation has led key DeFi partnerships and integrations from liquidity protocols to infrastructure projects, and solidified Arbitrum as a robust platform for DeFi applications. <strong>The Robinhood Wallet X Arbitrum Foundation collaboration</strong>, for instance, enabled low-cost in-app swaps for traders and paved the way for a new wave of adoptions. Other key examples include Synthetix, Venus Protocol, CoW Swap, and Renzo.</li>\n<li><strong>Doubling down on Gaming:</strong> Key gaming deployments and milestones for the first half of 2024 include Pirate Nation launching Apex Chain as an Orbit Chain, Square Enix (a prominent video game publisher) bringing Symbiogenesis to Arbitrum One, and InfiniGods’ King of Destiny Web3 mobile game integrating with Arbitrum Nova. Additionally, Arbitrum welcomed more than 15,000 visitors via the 2024 Game Developers Conference (GDC) to its booth during the three-day event, which exposed traditional gaming professionals to the opportunities in Web3 gaming and in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Orbit Chains Multiply:</strong> In January 2024, the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program (AEP) catalyzed the rapid growth of Orbit chains. The AEP introduced licensing terms that made it simple for projects to create custom Arbitrum Layer 2s (L2s) that directly settle on Ethereum, as well as Arbitrum Layer 3s (L3s) on other non-Arbitrum chains. Major communities like Apes and Treasure have chosen Arbitrum Orbit through open procurement processes despite strong competition, and other significant projects, such as Azuki, Degen, and Sanko, have also been drawn to its value proposition and are building their own Orbit chains.</li>\n<li><strong>Stylus Ecosystem Growth:</strong> In an effort to boost pre-launch awareness, the Arbitrum Foundation organized a ‘Stylus Blitz Buildathon’, where 7 teams were granted $1,500 each for building Stylus contracts on Arbitrum Sepolia. In addition to the open competition, the Foundation has also sponsored developer toolings like Software Development Kit (SDK) and Command Line Interface (CLI) tools to ease the migration and development processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57468-educational-and-community-initiatives-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57468-educational-and-community-initiatives-6\"></a>Educational and Community Initiatives</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57468-event-sponsorships-and-participation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57468-event-sponsorships-and-participation-7\"></a>Event Sponsorships and Participation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Foundation cultivates a strong presence within the Ethereum developer community by purposefully sponsoring, attending, and co-hosting important third-party conferences such as ETH events.</li>\n<li>The Foundation plans and leads events tailored to the Arbitrum community, such as Arbitrum Day, which offers networking and targeted education opportunities.

That said, we think it is important to start seeking feedback as soon as possible. Following extensive conversations with key stakeholders and active delegates, we’ve strived to distill their thoughts and ideas into a cohesive vision for the Arbitrum DAO, presented below.</em></p>\n<p><strong>[Arbitrum’s Vision is] to accelerate the universal shift onchain by empowering the freedom to advance scalable, secure, and trust-minimized applications.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[Arbitrum’s Mission is] to bring secure, compelling, and full-featured rollups to the masses.</strong></p>\n<p>Arbitrum is in the midst of a <strong>hyper-growth phase</strong>. In 5 years, Arbitrum should be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An expansive ecosystem of Orbit chains distributing high-quality blockspace through the Arbitrum tech stack. Every Orbit chain extends a unified Arbitrum brand.</li>\n<li>An incubator that fosters native application and infrastructure development with Arbitrum One, becoming the most sought-after blockspace in crypto across a diverse range of verticals.</li>\n<li>An ARB token recognized by the market as a result of value accrual from various sources in order to enhance rollup security.</li>\n<li>Home to crypto’s most popular apps, many of which use Stylus as a mission-critical component to their codebase.</li>\n<li>A strategic resource allocator capitalizing on Arbitrum’s growth by investing in infrastructure and applications that capture value in the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>The premier tech suite providing flexibility and freedom to builders through features such as Timeboost, BoLD, custom gas tokens, sovereign governance, Stylus, and more.</li>\n<li>Governed by the most robust DAO with aligned, active, sophisticated, and diverse delegates helping drive the ecosystem forward.</li>\n<li>Supported by a sustainable, revenue-generating DAO with multi-faceted programs and efficient operational structures.</li>\n<li>Committed to extending Ethereum’s values. Arbitrum is the default destination  for users to interact with genuinely decentralized, trust-minimized technologies.</li>\n<li>A household name with recognition on par with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Arbitrum is the gateway to Ethereum for new users from other chains and the real world.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In March 2023, the Arbitrum DAO was born with the launch of the ARB governance token. One of the largest and most widespread airdrops to date, the ARB token was distributed to over 580,000 unique addresses and 137 applications built on Arbitrum One. This moment marked a historic achievement, giving decentralized governance full control over all aspects of the execution environment; a pivotal step in the quest to scale Ethereum.</p>\n<p>Over the past 15 months, tremendous progress has been made. Core developers announced the completion of Timeboost, Stylus, and BoLD. The Arbitrum Foundation quickly scaled to a team of over 30 contributors, and the Arbitrum DAO launched multiple grant programs, incentive initiatives, and investment ventures. Yet, one clear hole has emerged in the DAO, <strong>a lack of alignment on our objectives</strong>. When posed with the question, “What will Arbitrum look like in 5 years?”, it’s likely that developers, the Foundation, and the DAO’s many contributors would provide diverse answers. While Arbitrum’s bottom-up nature is one of its strengths, we now recognize the need for a unified vision—<strong>a north star to guide us</strong>. Additionally, a clear vision is required for the DAO to pursue its own brand and marketing strategies.</p>\n<p>Today, each organization operating in the DAO must extrapolate for itself what it should work towards that contributes the most value to Arbitrum. Questions arise like should my organization work toward operational sustainability and painting a picture of ARB as a productive asset? Growth of Orbit? Growth of Stylus? Growth of Arbitrum one? Public Goods? etc. With a lack of visible direction, being an effective DAO operator becomes difficult. Additionally, the absence of concrete goals has made it challenging for the DAO to facilitate oversight and accountability. A system has been created where all the DAO can effectively do is judge “did this organization work hard” but lacks the ability to judge “did this organization do a good job moving Arbitrum forward?”</p>\n<p>Arbitrum has always embraced the principle that the technology should speak for itself. As the largest layer-2 solution by nearly every metric, and the major rollup closest to reaching Stage 2, Arbitrum represents more than just outstanding tech. Arbitrum embodies Freedom:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orbit Chains</strong>: Applications can now create their own fully customizable blockspace. Orbit chains act as Web3 servers tapping into the underlying liquidity and user base of Arbitrum One or any other chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Stylus</strong>: Provides the freedom to leverage the efficiencies of Rust, C, and C++ to write smart contracts without losing EVM compatibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Timeboost</strong>: A new transaction ordering policy with an express lane auction system that generates revenue for the DAO without hindering UX.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, Arbitrum offers permissionless access to the best scaling tech stack in crypto, allowing any user, developer, or individual to build and interact with trust-minimized technologies in seconds.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57467-our-guiding-principles-thus-far-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57467-our-guiding-principles-thus-far-2\"></a>Our Guiding Principles Thus Far</h3>\n<p>Since its creation, the Arbitrum DAO has been governed by its <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Constitution</a> and seven community values:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ethereum-aligned</strong>: Arbitrum is part of the Ethereum ecosystem and community</li>\n<li><strong>Sustainable</strong>: Focus on long-term health of the protocol over short-term gains</li>\n<li><strong>Secure</strong>: Arbitrum is security minded</li>\n<li><strong>Socially inclusive</strong>: Open and welcoming to all constructive participants</li>\n<li><strong>Technically inclusive</strong>: Accessible for ordinary people with ordinary technology</li>\n<li><strong>User-focused</strong>: Managed for the benefit of all users</li>\n<li><strong>Neutral and open</strong>: Foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These values have guided us thus far, but it is time to align on a grander vision.

To date, we have utilized approximately 75,042 ARB over the 12-week duration of the program.</p>\n<p>We are requesting to retain 174,958 ARB, bringing our total expenditure to 250,000 ARB out of the original 1,000,000, until the new grant programs are established.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Motivation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to highlight that incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods, such as the Pyth oracle, typically do not yield immediate results. The impact from making such incentives available to DeFi often unfolds over weeks or even months.</p>\n<p>For existing DeFi applications, switching to a new oracle involves significant effort and may require a new audit. Similarly, expanding from other chains to Arbitrum can be more time-consuming than anticipated, as illustrated by the Synthetix case <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023/20\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the initial LTIPP program, Arbitrum dApps had the ability to build robust oracle systems covering over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, FX, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. This advancement has eliminated outdated on-chain price updates and high costs, reinforcing Arbitrum’s position as a premier layer for DeFi. This progress empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications without constraints. This extension aims to keep the momentum and further empower potential new entrants like Synthetix to deliver a best-in-class protocol.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed extension of the Pyth Network’s LTIPP grant is designed to further cultivate a thriving and innovative DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The LTIPP program has already proven its effectiveness, with Pyth price updates on-chain increasing by 2-3 times and peaking at nearly 10 times the previous levels, reaching over 70,000 updates on July 14.</p>\n<p>Before the program began, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum was just over 43,000 ETH. This figure has since risen to 52,500 ETH, reflecting an increase of more than 20%.</p>\n<p>Pyth has also enabled over $16.1 billion in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges during June and July (with August data pending). This  underscores the benefits for applications powered by Pyth Network: protocols using Pyth have experienced, including increased total value locked (TVL), higher trading volumes, and more frequent price updates driven by a growing number of applications utilizing Pyth.</p>\n<p>The request for a 12-week extension, with a reduced ARB allocation, is part of our commitment towards responsible resource management commitment to responsible resource management while continuing to support the long-term success of applications built on Arbitrum that leverage Pyth. By covering the gas costs for using the Pyth oracle, the network has enabled more developers to create robust DeFi applications without the burden of high operational expenses.</p>\n<p>This strategy strengthens Arbitrum’s position as a premier platform for DeFi innovation, where developers can access over 500 price feeds without financial or technical constraints.</p>\n<p>It’s important to understand that the impact of incentives for infastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth price oracle are not immediate: it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it’s important to recognize that the impact of incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth oracle is not immediate; it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.</p>\n<p>This proposal, aims to build on the momentum generated by the initial LTIPP program, ensuring the continued growth and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem as new grant strategies are developed and implemented.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key Terms</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>On-demand or pull oracle: An oracle network where anyone can permissionlessly trigger price updates on-chain by doing an Arbitrum tx</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specifications</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>13 weeks duration</li>\n<li>175,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The proposed extension duration is similar to that of the previous LTIPP program—12 weeks versus 13 weeks (including retroactive rebates for the end of August). However, the amount of ARB tokens requested for gas rebates has increased from 75,000 ARB to 175,000 ARB.</p>\n<p>This increase reflects an anticipated rise in activity and associated costs, estimated at approximately 133%. The launch of Synthetix’s Multi-Collateral Perps on Arbitrum is expected to drive a substantial increase in the number of price updates triggered on-chain. For context, Synthetix currently triggers around 1,000 daily updates on Optimism and between 3,000 and 5,000 daily updates on Base—both without additional incentives in place.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves this extension, no additional work or involvement will be required from the DAO itself. The responsibility for managing the funds and continuing the program would remain entirely with the Pyth Data Association.</p>\n<p>As during the initial 12 weeks of the LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association would continue reimbursing dApps for gas costs every two weeks. Additionally, we would maintain our practice of providing bi-weekly updates on the Arbitrum forum to ensure transparency and accountability. Our latest report is available <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-bi-weekly-update-26-august-2024/26525\">here</a>, and we are open to including even more detailed data and information in these reports if needed.</p>\n<p>Since this is an extension of an already approved grant, no additional legal work is necessary. The Pyth Data Association has already completed KYC and signed the grant agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Timeline</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The LTIPP program officially ended on August 26, and until this extension proposal is approved, the Pyth Data Association has paused reimbursing the gas costs incurred by dApps during this period.</p>\n<p>If approved, the extension would be applied retroactively, starting from the end of the LTIPP program on August 26. This means that, depending on the timing of the Snapshot vote, there could be up to 2-3 weeks of retroactive gas rebates.</p>\n<p>The proposed extension would conclude on November 30, 2024.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Overall Cost</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cost to the Arbitrum DAO can be seen as an opportunity cost of 174,958 ARB, or potentially even less. Originally, the DAO approved a grant of 1,000,000 ARB—funds that were effectively budgeted and allocated—of which only 75,042 ARB was utilized during the 12-week LTIPP period.</p>\n<p>We are now requesting to retain 174,958 ARB from the initial allocation to continue offsetting costs for DeFi applications that use Pyth’s on-demand price feeds. The remaining 750,000 ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO as previously agreed under the LTIPP program. Furthermore, if any funds remain unspent before the outlined timeline concludes, Pyth Data Association will promptly return those ARB tokens to the DAO.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Additional Context</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have been actively seeking feedback and advice from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_stablelab\">@Matt_StableLab</a> to determine the best approach for moving forward with this extension request.</p>\n<p>Our interest in extending the LTIPP grant was initiated in the original LTIPP discussion <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003/10\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Currently, we plan to submit this extension request on Snapshot by Thursday, September 5, with support from Wintermute. This timeline allows ample opportunity to gather feedback on the proposal and make any necessary adjustments based on input from the DAO.</p>\n<p>Please note that Wintermute will merely be sponsoring the proposal as a delegate which is separate from their role as an LTIPP Council member.</p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 7 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-pyth-network-arbitrum-ltipp-extension-request/26533\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-pyth-network-arbitrum-ltipp-extension-request/26533","pubDate":"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:36:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26533"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-pyth-network-arbitrum-ltipp-extension-request/26533.rss","#text":"[RFC] Pyth Network Arbitrum LTIPP Extension Request"},"filter":false},{"title":"GovHack ETHcc Brussels 2024 - Impact Report - Hack Humanity","dc:creator":"KlausBrave","category":"Grants Discussions","description":"<p>Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024 - Impact Report</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57427-uploadhswo4t4z8qkttvcigljedyjuuepng-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57427-uploadhswo4t4z8qkttvcigljedyjuuepng-1\"></a><strong><strong><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02059913c118e1c850c916854b26fdff524e792c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hSWO4t4z8QKTtvcIgLJeDYjuuE.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/02059913c118e1c850c916854b26fdff524e792c_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hSWO4t4z8QKTtvcIgLJeDYjuuE\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/02059913c118e1c850c916854b26fdff524e792c_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/02059913c118e1c850c916854b26fdff524e792c_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02059913c118e1c850c916854b26fdff524e792c.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"394D63\"></a></div></strong></strong></h1>\n<p><strong>Title:</strong> GovHack ETHcc Brussels 2024</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal ID:</strong> <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-at-eth-cc-brussels/23305\">Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57427-executive-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57427-executive-summary-2\"></a>Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024, a three-day event held just before EthCC, brought together over 200 participants from 16 countries to drive governance innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

This would ensure that all tracks are well-represented and encourage more focused project development.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change the number of Tracks</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We had 10 tracks, while that meant we had a breadth of engagement, was that at the cost of depth of engagement. We could do the next GovHack to a much greater depth say on 3 tracks that are top priorities for the DAO for that quarter for instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Larger Scholarships:</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The $500 scholarships provided were not sufficient for participants travelling from outside Europe. One major delegate suggested increasing the scholarship amount to $2,500 per participant while curating the talent pool more selectively would better support the participation of high-value contributors. Ideal 20 x $2,500.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Workshops on Grants:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>More workshops focused explicitly on available grants and the application process would help participants better navigate the funding landscape and increase the quality of their proposals.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Venue Considerations:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>While the venue was generally well-received, future events should take into account the proximity to related conferences, like EthCC, to make it more convenient for participants.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Post GovHack Support</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facilitated program to support promising proposals to continue development and submission to the DAO. I.e. run online PitStops, schedule dedicated guidance and feedback sessions per track aspiring contributors can engage with. Ideal a dedicated 4 week online support/incubation program</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Target demographics and IRL program design considerations</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>GovHack was conceived and created by Hack Humanity for the following purposes:</p>\n<p>1. onboarding of new talent to solve issues for the DAO with proposals, success measures being increasing the quantity and quality of proposals.</p>\n<p>2. onboarding and development of existing and new delegates to exercise their role live realtime guiding and providing feedback to teams writing proposals</p>\n<p>3. a space for delegates and core contributors to network, build high trust relationships and make core complex DAO level decision making</p>\n<p>We assess that GovHack is doing 1 and 2 well, point 3 in particular complex DAO level decision-making isn’t something intentionally designed for in the program and facilitation, people in the DAO are showing up and defacto using GovHack in this way in the absence of a dedicated opportunity to fulfil that need.</p>\n<p>We have had 2 iterations of GovHack, I’d like to ideate with feedback here on what the 3rd iteration of GovHack needs to be most serving.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The possibility to either</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>have a dual track of strategic facilitation for delegates and core contributors to work through hard problems and make decisions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>use Day 1 as a mini offsite for delegates and core contributors with the support of structured facilitation to work through complex topics and make critical decisions, to sharpen up the most aligned tracks and challenge statements, then move to the hackathon with this enhanced clarity</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By reflecting on these challenges and the lessons learned, GovHack can continue to evolve and improve, ensuring that future events provide even greater value to participants and the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57427-conclusion-32\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57427-conclusion-32\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/46d43cbdbf75bada210ae3253dcdfc8f9deab430.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/a6A8D1UGDR5KVTniyQuZwC8jLZ6.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/46d43cbdbf75bada210ae3253dcdfc8f9deab430_2_690x240.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"a6A8D1UGDR5KVTniyQuZwC8jLZ6\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/46d43cbdbf75bada210ae3253dcdfc8f9deab430_2_690x240.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/46d43cbdbf75bada210ae3253dcdfc8f9deab430_2_1035x360.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/46d43cbdbf75bada210ae3253dcdfc8f9deab430.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"252E3B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024 showcased the powerful role in-person events play in sparking innovation and enhancing decentralized governance. With more than 200 participants from 16 countries, the event provided a fertile ground for turning ideas into actionable proposals.</p>\n<p>The event’s well-organized structure, featuring pre-event mapathons, expert pitstops, and educational panels, gave participants the tools they needed to navigate the complex process of developing proposals. By focusing on key areas relevant to the DAO’s goals, the event ensured that contributions were both meaningful and impactful. The democratic approach to judging and community voting highlighted a strong commitment to fostering genuine innovation.</p>\n<p>Participants were highly satisfied, as evidenced by a Net Promoter Score of 83 and robust social media engagement. However, the real highlight was the personal connections and sense of community that emerged—something often lacking in virtual environments.</p>\n<p>The insights gained, especially around the timing of educational sessions and team formation, will be invaluable for future events. As Arbitrum continues to grow, the lessons and networks established at GovHack Brussels will be instrumental in shaping the DAO’s future. This event underscored the importance of in-person engagement in driving decentralized governance forward, setting a new benchmark for community-driven innovation.</p>\n<p>HackHumanity has thoroughly enjoyed producing GovHacks and wishes to continue this tradition providing GovHacks as a key competitive advantage for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Have added a Quick Poll for future direction, feedback much appreciated → <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethcc-brussels-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/26530/5\">Poll</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57427-additional-resources-33\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57427-additional-resources-33\"></a>Additional Resources</h1>\n<p>To explore more about the Arbitrum GovHack Brussels 2024, including videos, proposals, photos, and media coverage, please refer to the following links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>After-Movie</strong>:<a href=\"https://youtu.be/rkbYA9UPw2c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Watch the 4-minute after-movie</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proposal Submissions</strong>: View all proposals on the Arbitrum Forum <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/govhack-brussels/41\">GovHack section</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkbYA9UPw2c&amp;list=PLkNAiFdvbPL5yHNQW8d329fSl9XlrvcAZ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">All media playlist</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mapathon Recordings and Miro Boards</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://us06web.zoom.us/rec/share/aUbuP2IHtmt_DlR17-SzvG8D9nAH7ZeJ5-5zXORtJAqtHNFXGQRjGb1dU6iw8PEH.MWo3ZeC-FyNrad_r?startTime=1718633212000\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mapathon Round 1 -

This extension will run from September 9th to November 6th, 2024, aligning the deployment of the remaining grant funds with a major product launch.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum community should implement this extension to maximize the impact of the originally approved grant, which targeted LP &amp; stablecoin incentives. By aligning the distribution with the launch of our Arbitrum-exclusive Multi-Collateral Perps feature, we can ensure greater engagement, trading volume, and overall ecosystem growth.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Synthetix has experienced unforeseen delays in its deployment of Synthetix Perps on Arbitrum. We originally expected to launch by late July, to align with one month of Perps fee rebates. However, due to audits and other factors, and to ensure the top performance of our Arbitrum-exclusive multi-collateral perps feature, we’ve been unable to hit these targets. As a result, we’ve not utilized 900k ARB from our proposal and would like to seek an extension.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-key-terms-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-key-terms-5\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Multi-Collateral Perps</strong></strong> : A feature allowing users to margin with ETH, BTC, and USDx for perpetual futures trading on Arbitrum with Synthetix Perps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The extension will utilize the remaining 900k ARB tokens from our original proposal for trading fee rebates. These rebates will be distributed over 8 weeks, coinciding with the launch of Multi-Collateral Perps. This approach ensures:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Full implementation of the Multi-Collateral Perps feature</li>\n<li>Complete integration with frontend partners, particularly Kwenta as our launch partner</li>\n<li>Enhanced capital efficiency with multiple margin options, new trading strategies, trading types, etc.</li>\n<li>Improved user experience and market competitiveness as an Arbitrum exclusive launch</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-steps-to-implement-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-steps-to-implement-7\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Launch Multi-Collateral Perps feature on Arbitrum (this week)</li>\n<li>Begin distribution of trading fee rebates</li>\n<li>Monitor and report on the impact of the rebates and new feature</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-timeline-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-timeline-8\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Start Date: September [TBD] based on Snapshot vote timing</li>\n<li>End Date: November [TBD] based on Snapshot vote timing</li>\n<li>Total 8 week program from starting date.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57400-overall-cost-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57400-overall-cost-9\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p>The extension utilizes the remaining 900,000 ARB tokens from the originally approved 2 million ARB grant.

However, over time, the protocol’s most prominent and consistent use has been as the underlying infrastructure for the “Hyperliquid” app—a platform that demands high throughput and seamless liquidity management.</p>\n<p>Given this focused application, the proposed name “HyperLiquid Bridge” (HLB) is a direct reflection of Arbitrum’s role in the ecosystem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hyper:</strong> Denoting the protocol’s ability to support Hyperliquid’s high-speed, high-volume transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquid:</strong> Emphasizing its role in ensuring fluid liquidity movement essential for Hyperliquid’s operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Bridge:</strong> Highlighting its function in connecting Hyperliquid to the broader blockchain network, facilitating interoperability and scalability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Focused Identity:</strong> Renaming the protocol to HLB underscores its primary function in serving the Hyperliquid app. This brings a clearer and more focused identity, distinguishing it from other Layer 2 solutions by associating it directly with its most significant application.</li>\n<li><strong>Brand Alignment:</strong> The name HLB aligns the protocol’s branding with its main use case, strengthening its association with the Hyperliquid app and providing a cohesive narrative for users and stakeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Market Positioning:</strong> By naming the protocol after its most prominent application, the new branding helps position HLB as the definitive infrastructure for Hyperliquid, rather than a generic Layer 2 solution. This distinction will solidify its reputation within the specific niche it serves.</li>\n<li><strong>Efficiency in Communication:</strong> For developers, partners, and users, the HLB name simplifies communication by making the connection between the protocol and its primary application explicit, reducing any ambiguity about its main purpose.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Implementation Plan:</strong> The transition from “Arbitrum” to “HLB” will be carefully managed to ensure a seamless experience for the Hyperliquid app and its users. Key steps include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Involve the Hyperliquid community in the renaming process to gather feedback and ensure broad support for the change.</li>\n<li><strong>Brand Rollout:</strong> Update all branding, including the protocol’s website, technical documentation, and communication channels, to reflect the HLB name.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical Updates:</strong> Ensure all technical documentation, APIs, and SDKs are updated to align with the new name, and work closely with the Hyperliquid team to coordinate this transition.</li>\n<li><strong>Partner Coordination:</strong> Communicate the change to partners and integrated platforms, focusing on those directly involved with the Hyperliquid app to ensure continuity and compatibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Renaming the Arbitrum protocol to HLB (HyperLiquid Bridge) is a strategic decision that aligns the protocol’s identity with its predominant use case, the Hyperliquid app. This change will clarify its role in the ecosystem, streamline communication, and reinforce its market position as the infrastructure behind Hyperliquid.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-low-cost-enhancement-to-hyperliquid-integration/26521\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-low-cost-enhancement-to-hyperliquid-integration/26521","pubDate":"Tue, 27 Aug 2024 17:01:00 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26521"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-low-cost-enhancement-to-hyperliquid-integration/26521.rss","#text":"Proposal: Low-cost Enhancement to HyperLiquid Integration"},"filter":false},{"title":"Gains Network Bi-Weekly Update [26-08-2024]","dc:creator":"clJoseph","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-57364-recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57364-recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p><strong>ARB Received Last Disbursement:</strong> 375,000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks:</strong> 327,273 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trading Incentives (163,636 ARB per Epoch):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>gTrade Trading Incentives:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>****<a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7401374ce116b71abd1e2ae6351d21c2296d8787\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EpochBasedTokenClaim | Address 0x7401374ce116b71abd1e2ae6351d21c2296d8787 | Arbitrum One</a></p>\n<p><strong>LP Incentives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Merkle Incentives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GNS/ETH on Camelot</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9b6FF025AeE245D314c09F57B72f0dE6E231c3a6\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AlgebraPool | Address 0x9b6FF025AeE245D314c09F57B72f0dE6E231c3a6 | Arbitrum One</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>gUSDC / USDC on Camelot</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3ef3d8ba38ebe18db133cec108f4d14ce00dd9ae#tokentxns\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/03140f11ed4113f8feff09d11818c8ab7939dbeb.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"6C8DA7\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3ef3d8ba38ebe18db133cec108f4d14ce00dd9ae#tokentxns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum L2 Explorer</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/345;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71af28613f12b34fa3525e9c71dbadd513869f9e_2_690x345.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F8F9\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3ef3d8ba38ebe18db133cec108f4d14ce00dd9ae#tokentxns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Angle Protocol: Distributor | Address...</a></h3>\n\n  <p>The Contract Address 0x3ef3d8ba38ebe18db133cec108f4d14ce00dd9ae page allows users to view the source code, transactions, balances, and analytics for the contract address.

From the DAO’s standpoint, yield-bearing assets are crucial for sustaining long-term TVL for both Balancer and Arbitrum. Liquidity providers benefit greatly from the various ways capital efficiency is encompassed by Balancers various unique pooling solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives:</strong> Balancer’s ARB incentive strategy focuses on directing BAL to existing gauges on Arbitrum, thereby boosting the highest-yielding pools for liquidity providers in terms of returns and fees. By leveraging Balancer’s core pool mechanisms and the STIP Addendum boost settings, this approach aims to create a thriving and sustainable environment for the most beneficial asset classes on Arbitrum within Balancer.
