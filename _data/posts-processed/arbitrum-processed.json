This would attract more institutional investors who seek secure, compliant, and scalable investment opportunities, and allow existing companies and users to take advantage of these RWA-backed yield products without ever having to off-ramp USDC or move to a different chain.</li>\n<li>Diversification of Investment Portfolios: The introduction of RWA-backed yield products allows investors to build diversified portfolios directly within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This diversification is crucial for risk management and provides more options for yield-seeking behavior, broadening the appeal of Arbitrum to a wider investor base.</li>\n<li>Innovation in Collateral and Financial Markets: Providing builders with new forms of composable digital collateral can lead to the creation of innovative financial instruments and markets. This development supports Arbitrum’s positioning as a cutting-edge platform for financial technology.</li>\n<li>Robust Legal and Regulatory Framework: The secure, time-tested, bankruptcy-remote legal and regulatory framework that OpenTrade operates under, managed by regulated investment firms, adds a layer of security and trust.

Therefore, we instead aim to focus on encouraging activities which have unique value for Arbitrum and are designed in such a way to be net accretive and un-griefable. For example, deepening bridging liquidity in valuable pools, which will ultimately reduce fees for users, or increasing the quality of assets being bridged into Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>With this in mind, a huge part of this proposal is focused on helping to facilitate the migration from USDC.e to native USDC on Arbitrum. This is a strategic process of high importance to the DAO and Stargate is well placed to support.</strong></em></p>\n<p>It’s also important to note that we no longer foresee operational hurdles in receiving funds.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>750,000 ARB (37.5% of initial STIP)</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same way* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No, we plan to change the incentive mechanism. As mentioned, <strong>we aim to help the Arbitrum DAO achieve its strategic objectives through this proposal as opposed to simply increasing bridging volume</strong>.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Previously, our proposal aimed to direct 100% of the grant allocation to subsidize bridging fees for users (by rebating 0.06% of volume, equivalent to the protocol fee on Stargate). This included all pooled assets on the core Stargate protocol: USDC, USDT and ETH. However, given the aforementioned learnings from the last STIP cycle we are now proposing a more unique incentive mechanism which should provide higher value to the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p>Our proposed incentive distribution breakdown is as follows:</p>\n<p>65% (487,500) of the requested funds used to incentivise the growth of Stargate’s native USDC pool on Arbitrum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stargate is about to launch its V2 which, <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x1c55529c8df43cc97591696a135a7b82af27fb8c58a09cf0bdc80aa29310d27d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">among many improvements</a>, facilitates the bridging of native USDC alongside ETH and USDT (whereas V1 only supported USDC.e). The more native USDC liquidity available on Stargate, the easier it is for users to access this asset when bridging into the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Stargate’s pool is currently the 3rd largest holder of USDC.e on Arbitrum L2, and these incentives would help to essentially eliminate that, while significantly ramping up liquidity for native USDC.</li>\n<li>It’s a substantial challenge to migrate from USDC.e to native USDC, and therefore it’s a significant value proposition for those who bridge through Stargate to onboard directly into native USDC, supporting Arbitrum’s migration efforts.</li>\n<li>For users this will also reduce friction and confusion as native USDC expands within the ecosystem, with Stargate helping to proliferate that expansion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>25% (187,500) of the requested funds used to rebate fees for the bridging of OFTs (<a href=\"https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">omnichain fungible tokens</a>) into the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stargate is uniquely positioned as the sole user interface for most OFTs in the ecosystem. This includes some of the largest projects in DeFi, as well as many other STIP participants. For example: $RDNT, $USDe ($sUSDe and $ENA), $JOE, $rsETH. This also includes assets that have been permissionlessly expanded to Arbitrum as OFTs via several governance votes, such as <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gmx.eth/proposal/0xd1b6a1b2b3341d87caae34bb29817513a2108cc9de943556d46f8eed5e4790e0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$WBNB</a> and <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gmx.eth/proposal/0x7d70cb94128482bcae66e8815ad2cfd04126b702931504c58bdc88e11163c7a4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$OP</a> used in GMX markets.</li>\n<li>Eliminating the cost for the bridging of these tokens is something we view as very valuable to the underlying protocols, and could drive greater trading volume on (Perps) DEXes, staking, and governance participation on the Arbitrum Network.</li>\n<li>It’s important to note that Stargate currently only charges 2bps on OFT bridging, so this amount is sufficient to rebating over $1B in volume. While the fee isn’t necessarily prohibitive, associated marketing campaigns alongside Radiant, TraderJoe, GMX, etc. could go a long way to bringing a higher concentration of the global token supply to Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>10% (75,000) of the requested funds used for fee rebates on native ETH bridging.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stargate is uniquely placed in offering deep liquidity when bridging ETH into Arbitrum. For example, at time of writing, you can bridge &gt;1500ETH (~$4.5M) from Optimism to Arbitrum in a single transaction, in ~25 seconds. On Stargate V2, bridging protocol fees are dynamic and will be 6bps or less. This portion of funds would be used to rebate 80% of the fees incurred by users when bridging into Arbitrum over the relevant period.</li>\n<li>Observing the previous STIP period, it was a real learning for Stargate to witness some providers outright paying for volume into Arbitrum, which can of course be griefed and is counterproductive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the newly proposed incentive mechanism outlined in this proposal we think the following KPIs will be relevant to track going forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OFT specific volume flowing into Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Total Supply of OFT assets on Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Native Ethereum volume flowing into Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Native USDC liquidity.</li>\n<li>Reduction in USDC.e liquidity.</li>\n<li>Where the funds bridged in flow once they arrive on Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?<br>\nThe address will be:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisig to receive the incentives: StargateDAO Multisig: <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9cd50907aeb5d16f29bddf7e1abb10018ee8717d\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stargate Finance: Multisig | Address 0x9cd50907aeb5d16f29bddf7e1abb10018ee8717d | Arbiscan</a></li>\n<li>Contracts that will distribute the incentives:\n<ul>\n<li>StargateMultiRewarder used for distributing incentives to native USDC poolers\n<ul>\n<li>[not yet announced] - will be shared once Stargate V2 is publicly announced (mid/late May).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>StargateIncentiveDistributor for OFT and ETH bridging incentives\n<ul>\n<li>[not yet deployed] - will be shared ASAP</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The multisig used to receive the incentives will be the same, while the incentive distribution contract changed compared to STIP</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Could you share any feedback or suggestion on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While the overall experience was positive, we did find some difficulties in drafting the initial proposal and getting proper feedback.

The aggregate budgeted cost across these programs for signers stands at 158,000 ARB, with an annualized total expenditure, based on estimations, of 470,000 ARB or $627,840 at an ARB price of $1.34. This is a high cost for the DAO to pay on a purely operational function, especially <strong>considering that these operational costs will likely rise as more programs are funded.</strong></p>\n<p>We propose creating a “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS) to unlock significant cost-saving opportunities, lessen committee fragmentation, ensure signers are competent with multi-sigs, and reduce friction for contributors creating proposals. The MSS will comprise 12 elected individuals to all DAO-funded multi-sigs. They will be compensated a base USD amount, paid in ARB, for performing these services across the DAO.</p>\n<p>This proposal also includes the optional steps to fund the implementation of r3gen monthly Token Flow reporting on inflows (revenue) and outflows (spend) across the DAO as well as providing detailed information and analysis on spending from MSS multisigs. Together, this proposal will help create a “backroom finance” function within the DAO that can be used across different initiatives.</p>\n<p>The proposed changes offer the potential to generate substantial cost savings, estimated to be ~$315,000 per annum, while increasing efficiency, transparency, and security of DAO spending.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO oversees six programs which pay multi-sig signers. Each multi-sig typically has five signers, except for the STIP and STIP backfund programs, which share the same multi-sig and have nine signers budgeted for. The table below outlines these programs, including the amount funded, duration (in months), and annualized figures to project a forecasted amount if future programs were to continue in the same manner.</p>\n<p>Here’s a breakdown of the programs:<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/n3ksB1H6usGNluKRMreNWZ3avqs.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 9.46.01 AM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_689x263.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 9.46.01 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"n3ksB1H6usGNluKRMreNWZ3avqs\" width=\"689\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_689x263.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_1033x394.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B6C3CF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The analysis underscores the operational unsustainability of the current expenditure level, with an annualised cost totalling $627,840 USD based on the average ARB price of $1.34 between August 7, 2023 and April 30, 2024, the period starting when Arbitrum DAO’s first multisig was funded.</p>\n<p>The cost per transaction appears excessive when comparing these figures against the volume of unique transactions sent from each multi-sig. While analysis for all multi-sig wallets is included for completeness, the STIP/Backfund multi-sig provides the clearest picture of the “cost per transaction” due to its proximity to completion.</p>\n<p>This analysis highlights the urgent need for restructuring and cost optimization within the Arbitrum DAO to ensure financial sustainability and operational efficiency in the long term.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/33h0Gzlv7Hg02RZJtnAyPjyWKsS.png?dl=1\" title=\"UTS\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_689x226.png\" alt=\"UTS\" data-base62-sha1=\"33h0Gzlv7Hg02RZJtnAyPjyWKsS\" width=\"689\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_689x226.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_1033x339.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ADBCCA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/y00Ac7P8UG4yzGSIRNKGSaP1med.png?dl=1\" title=\"AS CpT\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_690x253.png\" alt=\"AS CpT\" data-base62-sha1=\"y00Ac7P8UG4yzGSIRNKGSaP1med\" width=\"690\" height=\"253\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_690x253.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_1035x379.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"97B0C6\"></a></div><br>\nIt is also worth highlighting that the current structure has individuals appearing across multiple different multi-sigs, drawing income from each.<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7pnTF8JLQ90HZvpubC2WdySyn9b.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5_2_602x343.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"7pnTF8JLQ90HZvpubC2WdySyn9b\" width=\"602\" height=\"343\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5_2_602x343.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E1E6E8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Currently, the DAO experiences a significant dispersion in its structure, where each funded program operates its own multi-sig. This fragmentation not only leads to redundancy but also elevates the overall cost of operations. Through the “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS), we can eliminate these inefficiencies and significantly reduce unnecessary expenditure.</p>\n<p>Additionally, individuals on multi-sigs are generally not elected, posing a challenge in consistently ensuring that only the most trusted and competent members manage these critical roles. By shifting to an elected model within the MSS, we can enhance transparency, accountability, and professionalism, ensuring that every signer meets a high standard of trust and competency.</p>\n<p>Finally, contributors currently face friction in advancing proposals due to the need to wrangle signers, which can delay or deter the proposal process. The MSS aims to streamline this process by providing a reliable and consistent team of signers to be included in proposals, thereby reducing the time and effort of contributors, and accelerating the pace at which the DAO can execute its initiatives.</p>\n<p>By creating a structured multisig committee, process, and reporting cadence around spending, the DAO will be better equipped to service its plethora of proposals that require payments and maintain transparency around the programs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-solution-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-6\"></a>Proposed solution</h2>\n<p>The proposed framework for the Arbitrum DAO aims to address these issues by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO elects 12 signers via Snapshot weighted voting, shielded with Shutter\n<ul>\n<li>Signers, when submitting their application to join the MSS, may opt in to be an MSS Chair, who will be responsible for communicating to the DAO on the MSS’s behalf. The three opted-in signers with the highest weight according to Snapshot will be allocated MSS Chairs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For each new DAO initiative requiring a multisig, a new 12 signer multisig is set up.\n<ul>\n<li>The signing threshold will be dependent on the total dollar denominated value of the wallet<br>\ni. 5/12: &lt;$1M<br>\nii. 6/12: $1M-$5M<br>\niii. 7/12: $5M-$10m<br>\niiii. 8/12 $10M-$50M</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Signers are paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB using spot price at the time of payment. The MSS Chairs will be paid $2500 per month in ARB using the spot price.\n<ul>\n<li>We feel denominating the payment in a $ value is important to ensure the DAO pays a fair price for service rendered without the risk of ARB price movement leading to a series of overpayment or underpayment to signers for their duty.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This will be paid out monthly from the MSS multi-sig, which will be a 6/12 including the entirety of the MSS.\n<ul>\n<li>Payment for multisig signers will only start once the first new multisig is onboarded under the Multisig Support Service MSS structure.</li>\n<li>Existing multi-sigs have the option to “opt in” to the MSS structure. If they do so any existing ring-fenced budget for multisig signing should be sent directly to a new MSS multisig. An MSS Chair will coordinate with the Program to manage the transition process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The same process is repeated to onboard new MSS members 12 months after the first is complete (starting the process 4 months before the term is up to allow for ample time)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We suggest the program is capped at initiatives seeking funding of $50M or less. This will help ensure that the program is not bottlenecked by one single initiative. For programs seeking more than $50M in funding, we suggest inspiration in design be taken from this model while creating a dedicated multisig committee and process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"mss-mechanics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#mss-mechanics-7\"></a>MSS Mechanics</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"who-would-be-a-suitable-multi-sig-signer-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#who-would-be-a-suitable-multi-sig-signer-8\"></a>Who would be a suitable multi-sig signer?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Actively involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem</li>\n<li>Prior experience being on multi-sigs.

(i.e. hack someone’s Telegram and tell the grants program to queue a payment up to the hacker’s wallet).</p>\n<p>An example of this structure</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Disruption Joe, Shawn and Ben can request a msig payment.</li>\n<li>Request made in “PL Payment” Telegram group”</li>\n<li>Supporting evidence of the payment will need to be produced to be reviewed by the signers (a forum post, an invoice, a milestone sign off etc)</li>\n<li>One written approval as indicated by “<img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12\" title=\":+1:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":+1:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">” on the payment message required from Joe, Shawn or Ben. “payment approver” cannot also be by “payment requestor”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the abstraction of responsibility from multisig signers and program operators, this step is important to ensure the security and integrity of fund transfers.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment request: format</strong></p>\n<p>Payment requests should be structured as follows by the “payment requestor”</p>\n<p>Name of supplier | Category | nature of the payment | supporting evidence</p>\n<p>This will allow for multisig approvers to better understand the details of the payment they are being asked to process. Moreover, by ensuring clear supplier name and categorization a more efficient reporting flow can be maintained. The category of payment is to be defined by the program itself (i.e. “Tooling”, “Contributor payment”, “legal fees”). If the DAO wishes to move ahead with Token Flow reporting, r3gen finance will also conduct discovery with each program team to help them define and confirm program reporting categorization at the outset of their program.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"payment-signing-den-implementation-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#payment-signing-den-implementation-11\"></a>Payment signing: Den implementation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>To aid in the efficiency and security of multisig programs at Arbitrum, we propose the implementation of <a href=\"https://www.onchainden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Den</a> across all MSS multisigs.\n<ul>\n<li>Efficiency: Den will automatically notify Arbitrum multisig signers when there is a transaction to sign. It will allow them to see exactly what you’re signing at a glance and cut through the noise by auto-tagging and DMing signers</li>\n<li>Security: Den helps you know what you’re executing and identify malicious transactions. It allows Arbitrum multisig signers to: Simulate and decode transactions before they execute them and see the outcomes of transactions before they are signed. It also helps signers easily understand complex transaction inputs and automatically see what’s behind any address.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"conflict-of-interest-policy-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conflict-of-interest-policy-12\"></a>Conflict of Interest Policy</h4>\n<p>In order to maintain the integrity and impartiality of the MSS, signers must adhere to a strict Conflict of Interest Policy. This policy ensures that all decisions made by MSS signers are in the best interest of the DAO and free from personal gain or undue influence.</p>\n<p>A conflict of interest occurs when an individual’s personal interests interfere, or appear to interfere, with their responsibilities to the DAO. Conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Being directly compensated by the Multi-sig: Receiving payments, reimbursements, or any form of financial benefit directly from the multi-sig for which the signer is responsible (Exclusion for the MSS multisig itself which will be paying it’s signers directly for their services)</li>\n<li>Authoring a Proposal that Funded the Multi-sig: Proposals a signer has authored or co-authored, which directly results in funding or operational changes to the multi-sig.</li>\n<li>Personal or Financial Relationships: Having financial relationships with any parties that stand to benefit directly from the signer’s decisions in relation to the multi-sig operations.</li>\n<li>Other Conflicts: Any other circumstances where the signer’s ability to act in the best interest of the DAO may be compromised.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Procedure in the Event of a Conflict: If a conflict of interest arises, or if a situation arises that could be perceived as a conflict, the signer must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide Disclosure: Promptly disclose the conflict to the other members of the multi-sig committee.</li>\n<li>Recusal: Abstain from participating in discussions and decision-making processes related to the conflict.</li>\n<li>Reduced Signer Multisig: In the scenario that there is a situation deemed a COI, a multisig should be created without this signer(s) included. A new threshold &gt;50% of the total remaining signers should be included. For example, if there are 3 signers with a COI for an initiative, the new multisig for this initiative would maintain 5/9 threshold and total signers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All COI executions must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"removal-of-mss-members-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#removal-of-mss-members-13\"></a>Removal of MSS members</h4>\n<p>There are 2 paths to the removal of an MSS member:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DAO Snapshot: Any DAO member can propose a Snapshot vote to remove an MSS signer. The proposal should clearly state the reasons for removal and provide evidence supporting the claims. A simple majority of votes cast by the DAO members is required for the removal to be approved with an 80M ARB Quorum (defined as total ARB votes).</li>\n<li>MSS Member Agreement: If at least 50% of MSS members (6 out of 12 members) agree that a signer should be removed due to breach of duties or conflict of interest, they can initiate the removal process internally. The agreement must be documented and publicly disclosed to maintain transparency. Analytics on signer activity from Den may be used as supporting evidence.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a member is removed via the DAO Snapshot or MSS Member Agreement the member will immediately lose further compensation. Once a member is removed, the following steps will be taken to ensure continuity and maintain the governance structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interim Measures: The MSS may appoint an interim member to serve temporarily until a new member is officially elected. The 3 chairs will collaborate and decide how to select the new member.</li>\n<li>Subsequent Snapshot: A subsequent Snapshot vote will be held to elect a new MSS member. This ensures that the DAO participates in selecting a new signer, maintaining democratic and transparent governance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All removal proceedings, details around the new signer, and the reasons for the removal must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"expectations-of-mss-members-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#expectations-of-mss-members-14\"></a>Expectations of MSS members</h4>\n<p>Transactions are expected to be promptly (within 24 hours) reviewed by all signers, and if approved through the process outlined above, signed. While we realise that there will be times when a signer may not have internet access or some other deterrent to signing, these are expected to be few and far between.

[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong><br>\n<strong>New major protocol feature laucnhed based on STIP learnings</strong></p>\n<p>MUX Degen Protocol</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The lack of market diversity and low listing time efficiency has been a long-standing bottleneck for on-chain perps protocol. Although MUX was able to offer 140+ markets as an aggregator (thanks to all the integrated protocols), it still couldn’t offer trendy markets with higher efficiency like CEXes. During the bull markets, faster listing speed is critical to onboarding &amp; retaining traders.</li>\n<li>As MUX onboarded more users during the previous STIP, MUX received more users’ requests for trendy markets listings, and this motivated MUX to design and launch the MUX Degen Protocol that can launch trendy long-tail asset markets timely. The MUX Degen Protocol is exclusively available on Arbitrum.\n<ul>\n<li>Upon launch, the MUX Degen Protocol has been integrated into the MUX Aggregator.</li>\n<li>The MUX Degen Protocol has listed 8 markets since launch: $BOME, $ETHFI, $ENA, $W, $TNSR, $SAGA, $TAO, $REZ.</li>\n<li>Since the MUX Degen Protocol is exclusively available on Arbitrum, MUX aims to use the Degen Protocol to continuously onboard more organic traders to the ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MUXLP Tranches</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The MUXLP pool is a multi-asset pool that serves as traders’ counterparty. LPs will earn a portion of the protocol fees and additional MUX token rewards but also bear positions holding related risks.</li>\n<li>MUXLP yield greatly benefited from the increased trading volume during STIP, and more LPs were onboarded. MUX contributors learned from LP feedback that offering pools tailored for LPs with different risk-exposure preferences can help to onboard and retain more LPs. To meet the demands of LPs with different risk-exposure preferences, MUX has released a risk-free senior tranche and leveraged mining junior tranche on top of the MUXLP pool.</li>\n<li>Senior Tranche\n<ul>\n<li>The senior tranche is a delta-neutral USDC-only pool that will lend liquidity to the junior tranche. The senior tranche’s yield will derive from a portion of the junior tranche’s income. LP’s principals in the senior tranche won’t be affected by market volatility; the junior tranche strategies &amp; liquidation setup will ensure the principals supplied from the senior tranche won’t bear any losses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Junior Tranche\n<ul>\n<li>The junior tranche, a MUXLP leveraged mining pool, offers the potential for exciting leveraged MUXLP yield. Its strategies will use up to 2.5x leverage, amplifying LP’s potential returns. However, junior tranche LPs will also face default and auto-deleveraging risks, and there are liquidation risks associated with using the junior tranche. Junior tranche LP’s principals will be affected when liquidation happens.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>MUXLP tranches users earn <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#RealYield</span> in the form of $USDC tokens weekly from MUXLP income. By offering additional $ARB token incentives for LPs, the pool size can potentially increase to support more trading demand and initiate a flywheel effect with the trading incentives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incentivization Strategy Takeaways</strong></p>\n<p>During the previous STIP, MUX rebated up to 100% open &amp; close fees for all integrated protocols on the MUX aggregator with the goal of aggressively onboarding more traders to Aribtrum. MUX witnessed notable volume and DAU growth during the campaign; however, based on the aggregator data from 30-day-before, 30-day-after and during the STIP program, although the incentives can stimulate more trading activities during drastic market movements, natural market volatility is still the main factor to drive trading volume, and the incentives serve as an additional boost.<br>\n<strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8127cbd92280309941fb9d4a0aa7400bfb6c13e4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/iqyR7Eik8hi6F6xd94lCW7RvvLe.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8127cbd92280309941fb9d4a0aa7400bfb6c13e4_2_624x336.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"iqyR7Eik8hi6F6xd94lCW7RvvLe\" width=\"624\" height=\"336\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8127cbd92280309941fb9d4a0aa7400bfb6c13e4_2_624x336.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8127cbd92280309941fb9d4a0aa7400bfb6c13e4_2_936x504.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8127cbd92280309941fb9d4a0aa7400bfb6c13e4_2_1248x672.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F6F2\"></a></strong></div><br>\nSince volatility is the core volume driver, incentives should serve as an additional stimulus for cost-sensitive traders to generate more volume when they prefer to trade.

Since the expected duration of STIP is 3 months, the rebate rate can be potentially adjusted along the way based on the grant spending speed.\n<ul>\n<li>Compared with the previous STIP, the max rebate rate has been updated from 100% to 75%.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If the rebate rates need to be adjusted according to grant spending speed and market conditions, MUX will notify the community before making any changes.</li>\n<li>The final rebate rate will be based on the users’ actual fees spent. If the integrated protocols offer additional rebates/rewards separately, MUX will ensure the final total rebates won’t exceed the fees paid.</li>\n<li>No wash trading or Sybil-attack-related activities are allowed. MUX contributors will apply the same anti-wash-trading from the previous STIP to closely monitor related activities from this campaign; Addresses involving wash trading or Sybil-attack-related activities will be published and excluded from receiving the rebates.\n<ul>\n<li>In the previous STIP, MUX protocol had one of the lowest sybil rates of 0.270%</li>\n<li>MUX contributors reserve the right to identify any Sybil-attack-related addresses and exclude them from the incentive program.</li>\n<li>The anti-wash-trading &amp; anti-sybil-attack rules will remain unrevealed. Otherwise, the rules can be abused with planned strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tentatively, 45% of the grant will be utilized to increase yield for the MUXLP tranches on Arbitrum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100% of the MUXLP tranches liquidity is on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>MUXLP tranches are built based on the MUXLP pool while meeting more diverse risk-exposure preferences from LPs. The goal is to onboard more LPs and increase LP retention.\n<ul>\n<li>As more high-yield farming opportunities appear during the bull market to win LPs, the leveraged-mining Junior Tranche is designed to attract more LPs with higher yield based on MUXLP income.</li>\n<li>The delta-neutral Senior Tranche is tailored for LPs needing risk-free farming opportunities without worrying about principal drawdown.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>MUX aims to effectively incentivize the tranches to increase LP adoption and retention for the ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10.</strong> <strong>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong><br>\nAddresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funding Address: 0x4Fa610DD115e790B8768A482Fc366803534e9Adc</li>\n<li>Funding Address Characteristics: 2/3 multisig</li>\n<li>Contract Address: 0xe21d366d5042F713C0C872591e610fB6a74C775b</li>\n<li>No changes compared to the previous STIP proposal</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>11. Could you share any feedback or suggestion on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong><br>\nThe incentive programs significantly boost protocol adoption and accelerate protocol PMF testing and improvements. The protocol submission, review, and individual voting process could’ve caused hassles for participants, delegates, advisors, and PMs, but for something that only happens a few times a year, the more decentralized process is reasonable.</p>\n<p>We propose an enhancement to the grant cap tier system, which will be based on relative protocol and sector metrics. This system will define the stage of the applicant protocol, offering more open opportunities while using a pre-determined guideline. The key benefit of this system is its potential to streamline the process, making it more efficient and effective for all participants.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower cap tier for relatively new kickstarter protocols that have innovative offerings but has limited track record, TVL, DAU, volume, etc.</li>\n<li>Mid cap tier for protocols with proven pmf, innovative offerings growing metrics, and a convincing reason for why the grant can help to accelerate adoption</li>\n<li>Higher cap tier for protocols with prominent TVL, volume, revenue and community to help with further adoption and more exposure for the ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Establishing a more dedicated Arbitrum incentive programs channel and Twitter page is also crucial. The dedicated channel can be a central hub for sharing all incentive programs’ existence and core progress. Currently, we have multiple separate Telegram channels for different programs, but they might not be effective enough to keep all intended applicants informed. A dedicated platform will ensure better communication and increased awareness, benefiting all participants involved in the process.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/mux-protocol-stip-addendum/23726\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/mux-protocol-stip-addendum/23726","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 18:58:31 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23726"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/mux-protocol-stip-addendum/23726.rss","#text":"MUX Protocol STIP Addendum"},"filter":false},{"title":"Updates to the STIP Bridge Timeline","dc:creator":"Matt_StableLab","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h2><a name=\"extension-of-the-application-deadline-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#extension-of-the-application-deadline-1\"></a>Extension of the Application Deadline</h2>\n<p>Due to the many STIP /Backfund protocols missing the May 3rd Deadline, we are extending the deadline to apply to Tuesday, May 14th at 11:59 PM UTC.</p>\n<p>However, any Applications submitted after the initial May 3rd deadline will automatically require a challenge snapshot.</p>\n<p>All challenge snapshots posted must receive at least 66% of the votes in favor of funding (Excluding abstain votes) in order to receive their bridge funding.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-to-apply-late-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-to-apply-late-2\"></a>How to Apply Late</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new forum thread in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/stip-bridge-addendum/29\">STIP Bridge section</a> of the forum</li>\n<li>Title thread [Protocol Name] STIP Addendum</li>\n<li>After creating an addendum thread, Applicants will be assigned an Advisor</li>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdpAZAopmragWobcY3MdlROJN0hU3y_cAn0JOkdpsOE/edit?usp=sharing\">Addendum Template</a> to apply</li>\n<li>Applicants will then have until May 14th at 6:00 PM UTC to work with their advisor and finalize their addendum</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"extension-of-the-challenge-and-review-period-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#extension-of-the-challenge-and-review-period-3\"></a>Extension of the Challenge and Review Period</h2>\n<p>To give delegates more time to evaluate the success of STIP campaigns we will be extending the Challenge and review period until Monday, May 20th at 5:00 PM UTC</p>\n<p>The ARDC will be posting an analysis and report of the STIP to give delegates a better understanding of which protocols were successful in their STIP campaigns.</p>\n<p>Challenge Snapshots will now all start Monday, May 20th at 6:00 PM UTC.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"what-happens-during-the-challenge-and-review-period-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-happens-during-the-challenge-and-review-period-4\"></a>What Happens During the Challenge and Review Period</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Challenge and Review Period will run until May 20th, 5:00 PM UTC.</li>\n<li>Delegates will review the addendums to identify applicants they believe need further review before being funded.

While we are all for helping protocols provide their users with incentives, we shouldn’t forget that protocols should grow because they have a strong product that is being used, not because they’re giving away free money courtesy of the DAO.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, incentives are meant to highlight protocols’ competitive advantages by incentivizing users to try them. Incentives are not meant to <em>be a</em> competitive advantage in and of themselves.</p>\n<p>We’ve found ourselves in a precarious position where if some protocols do not receive incentives, they’re at a disadvantage to the ones that do, and they are driven away from building on Arbitrum because they cannot compete.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"taming-a-necessary-evil-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#taming-a-necessary-evil-2\"></a>Taming a necessary evil</h3>\n<p>Overall, incentives are a necessary evil for any ecosystem in the current landscape of crypto, including Arbitrum. They help boost numbers and make the ecosystem more appealing to users on other chains for them to move their capital over. They help users explore and experiment with different protocols to learn about what they have to offer, and they help protocols get more users to try them.</p>\n<p>However, the very existence of incentives creates a power imbalance between the biggest and most well-established protocols and the newer ones, especially the ones that haven’t yet deployed on Arbitrum. It creates an inherent competitive disadvantage, fosters a monopolistic mindset, and eventually drives builders away from Arbitrum which is a net negative for the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we need to find a way to leverage the advantage of offering incentives while mitigating the downside mentioned above.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"a-not-so-random-solution-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#a-not-so-random-solution-3\"></a>A not-so-random solution?</h3>\n<p>While internally thinking and discussing the different incentives program proposals we’ve had so far (STIP, Backfund, LTIPP and STIP Bridge), and how they all fit together, we realized that each of them had attempted in one way or another to mitigate the implications of some protocols having incentives while others didn’t.</p>\n<p>After brainstorming, we came up with an experimental approach that could prove to be a solution to the problems outlined above. Its goal is to unify the incentive programs wherever applicable so protocols under the same vertical do not compete with each other on the amount of incentives they provide. For example, the DAO should avoid situations where we are providing different amounts of incentives to 2 different DEXs if they both want to incentivize liquidity provision for an ARB/ETH pair — the amount of incentives shouldn’t be the only differentiating factor.</p>\n<p>We should find ways to be flexible in the distribution of incentives so protocols can leverage and showcase their unique features. Instead of creating a rigid rubric and asking every protocol to fit in it, we (e.g. the LTIPP council and application advisors) should work with protocols to make their incentive structure eligible for funding. As the famous quote goes, “You don’t judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree”.</p>\n<p>We’ve come up with a process that goes against the initial instincts of how an incentives program should work, but we believe it makes sense the more we think about it. On a high level, it looks like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protocols apply not to receive incentives, but to become eligible for receiving them. Similar to how the ADPC creates a list of whitelisted service providers, we’ll create a list of protocols that are eligible for receiving incentives. Eligibility basically means that they have a structured plan to distribute the incentives and they meet some minimum requirements.</li>\n<li>Every epoch (for example every month), we sample the projects from the list and randomly choose a few that will receive incentives for that epoch.</li>\n<li>The sampling should be done vertically (e.g. dex, yield, games, etc) and there should be mechanisms in place to prevent cases of protocols being “sure” that they’ll get incentives (e.g. if only 2 protocols exist under a vertical). We should also ensure that the chosen projects are rotating so no single protocol has over 2 consecutive epochs of incentives, even if by simple luck.</li>\n<li>The amount of incentives should somehow be normalized per epoch and per vertical so there are no big discrepancies between protocols of relatively same size. It is expected that protocols with more/less users will need more/less incentives, but that should be determined by the council in advance, as part of the protocol’s eligibility. This specific point should be discussed separately as it’s a broader topic and we will address it further in a separate post.</li>\n<li>Ideally, protocols receiving incentives should commit to some marketing effort during the epoch when they’re receiving incentives. For example, a multi-chain protocol should urge its users to use Arbitrum while incentives are running. This specific point should be discussed separately as it’s a broader topic and we will address it further in a separate post.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"why-selecting-at-random-might-make-sense-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#why-selecting-at-random-might-make-sense-4\"></a>Why selecting at random might make sense</h3>\n<p>The reasons why we thought about selecting a few protocols at random every epoch on a rotating basis are many:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incentives can act in a more targeted way to attract users.</li>\n<li>We can have a better sense of how effective incentives are at attracting users over a shorter period of time.</li>\n<li>Protocols under the same vertical won’t have to compete with all other protocols under the same vertical at the same time.</li>\n<li>We won’t have to play favorites as each protocol will have the same chance to be selected if they’re eligible.</li>\n<li>Makes protocols focus more on building cool products that stand out.</li>\n<li>Encourages users to seek which protocols have incentives during a given epoch and try them out.</li>\n<li>Enables the incentives program to be an ongoing thing that protocols can join at any time and reduces governance overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-thoughts-on-the-end-game-perpetual-incentives-program/23720\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-thoughts-on-the-end-game-perpetual-incentives-program/23720","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 16:42:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23720"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-thoughts-on-the-end-game-perpetual-incentives-program/23720.rss","#text":"[RFC] Thoughts on the End-Game Perpetual Incentives Program"},"filter":false},{"title":"ARDC DAO Advocate Discussion with Arbitrum DAO","dc:creator":"Sinkas","category":"Governance","description":"<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re hosting a call on <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/yng-nrnu-jms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Friday 10th of May at 1 pm UTC / 9 am EST / 9 pm SGT</a> to discuss with delegates and other governance contributors about how the ARDC can potentially help their initiative.</li>\n<li>The call is open to anyone to participate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Arbitrum Research and Development Collective (ARDC) was established to assist the DAO with reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement.

We are incredibly thankful to the Arbitrum community for the opportunity.</p>\n<p>With that being said, we decided not to apply for the STIP Bridge since <strong>we are currently working on Rysk v2. For this reason we don’t believe that asking for the STIP bridge incentives for Rysk will be the best ROI for the Arbitrum DAO</strong>. In the current state these incentives would not prove to be as beneficial as the ones during STIP.</p>\n<p>We are thankful to the Arbitrum DAO and we remain aligned with their long term vision; for this reason we would feel more comfortable returning and applying for future grants when appropriate, where they can have higher ROI for both Rysk and the DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"kpis-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#kpis-1\"></a>KPIs</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"depositors-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#depositors-2\"></a>Depositors</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/aa6e6b9f8e66810f167e896d4fb6dfb227666100.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ojHKaeUI9jK7tNSVuqfakv1l7Xi.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/aa6e6b9f8e66810f167e896d4fb6dfb227666100_2_690x341.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ojHKaeUI9jK7tNSVuqfakv1l7Xi\" width=\"690\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/aa6e6b9f8e66810f167e896d4fb6dfb227666100_2_690x341.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/aa6e6b9f8e66810f167e896d4fb6dfb227666100.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/aa6e6b9f8e66810f167e896d4fb6dfb227666100.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"BCBBBB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>New depositors showed an increase with the STIP start with another larger spike at the beginning of the year after delivering a track record of consistent high return with base yield + ARB rewards (see analysis below).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"returns-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#returns-3\"></a>Returns</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6a38a7021a7ab2de817c678d28d6fc92fcb4221d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/f9FZjNT6tLXylZGSQ43NZnCW4Q5.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6a38a7021a7ab2de817c678d28d6fc92fcb4221d.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"f9FZjNT6tLXylZGSQ43NZnCW4Q5\" width=\"690\" height=\"321\" data-dominant-color=\"FAFAFA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Cumulated weekly returns (base + STIP incentive) for Depositors were ~18% since the start of STIP (~48% annualized).

Overall during the STIP we were able to on-board many options traders and record ATH volumes and position as a top protocol by volume.</p>\n<p>Some of those traders are still trading after the STIP and even more importantly provided feedbacks, ideas and data on how to improve the product and build the future of Rysk</p>\n<h3><a name=\"lps-liquidity-is-critical-but-very-mercenary-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#lps-liquidity-is-critical-but-very-mercenary-10\"></a>LPs liquidity is critical but very mercenary</h3>\n<p>For pool based products like Rysk DHV having enough liquidity in the pool to sustain volumes is critical. Despite Rysk being one of the most capital efficient protocol in terms of Volume / TVL, a lack of TVL leads to a drop in volume due to the size traders can enter on. Once the STIP weekly distribution extended, reducing the amount distributed per week, many users withdrew and deposited into other Arbitrum protocols with STIP. Compared to traders, depositors were harder to keep around, reducing the effect of the flywheel.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"multi-protocol-short-term-incentive-programs-are-great-marketing-but-also-increase-mercenary-flows-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#multi-protocol-short-term-incentive-programs-are-great-marketing-but-also-increase-mercenary-flows-11\"></a>Multi-protocol short term incentive programs are great marketing but also increase mercenary flows</h3>\n<p>The impact of STIP was net positive for Rysk. One of the main advantage was the reputation and marketing directly provided by the STIP and other protocols in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Overall a multi protocol program like the STIP is definitely net positive. But from a protocol perspective there is also a downside effect due to the mercenary liquidity that they can attract. With Rysk we realized on the LP side that depositors where very quick to move liquidity to the best opportunity in the ecosystem and during a program like STIP there are many running in parallel making it very hard to retain users, unless offering higher incentives than other protocols. From an ecosystem perspective it creates a competition among protocols on the incentives distribution to attract LPs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rysk-v2-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rysk-v2-12\"></a>Rysk v2</h3>\n<p>The STIP provided Rysk with a great opportunity for growth along with the collection of user data and feedback. We learned that traders enjoyed the trading experience at Rysk, and STIP was an effective tool for onboarding new traders. Based on these insights, we are developing Rysk V2, with the core mission of generating a stable flow of volume and returns. For this reason, we believe that embarking on a STIP Bridge at this stage might not be very effective for Rysk’s growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem and we would rather apply for a future program with Rysk v2 where the ROI can be much more effective.</p>\n<p>Rysk v2 is focused on implementing solutions to the liquidity stickiness issues seen in the STIP. We expect to return with a more rounded, robust, and targeted product.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rysk-stip-addendum-forfeit/23703\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rysk-stip-addendum-forfeit/23703","pubDate":"Tue, 07 May 2024 17:07:15 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23703"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rysk-stip-addendum-forfeit/23703.rss","#text":"Rysk STIP Addendum Forfeit"},"filter":false},{"title":"7 May 2024 - Open Discussion of Proposals Governance Call","dc:creator":"cliffton.eth","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Hey folks!</p>\n<p>The link to join the governance call to discuss the proposal pipeline and notable discussions is on the <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Warsaw\">governance calendar</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 7, 2024</p>\n<p><strong>Time:</strong> 4:00 pm UTC</p>\n<p><strong>Link to join:</strong> <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/kvr-bpnx-zix\">https://meet.google.com/kvr-bpnx-zix</a></p>\n<p>The agenda below will be fluid.

As per STIP guidelines, projects were mandated to distribute their entire grant allocation by March 29, 2024, with any surplus funds being returned to the Arbitrum Multisig. This resulted in the return of approximately 736k claimed ARB tokens at the end of the STIP.</p>\n<p>Due to varying initial distribution dates for each project, we established a cut-off date for assessing performance metrics relative to the respective initial distribution dates. To normalize these metrics, we divided growth indicators by the value of ARB claimed, utilizing the average price of the ARB token from November 3 to March 29, 2024.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"ecosystem-analysis-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ecosystem-analysis-2\"></a>Ecosystem Analysis</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"key-takeaways-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-takeaways-3\"></a>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Protocols supported by the STIP outpaced non-STIP protocols on Arbitrum in TVL growth by 82.6 percentage points.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum added more than 94,000 daily active users throughout the STIP.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum realized an 101.9% increase in transaction volume, exceeding 1 million transactions per day by the end of the STIP.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"tvl-and-dau-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tvl-and-dau-4\"></a>TVL and DAU</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d8290600de21b7d8ad4175f4f3cd38395e8b6c5d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uQf1BLLB5qkgd3Hu5lrg26qPLR3.png?dl=1\" title=\"|624x351.33365019011404\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d8290600de21b7d8ad4175f4f3cd38395e8b6c5d_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"|624x351.33365019011404\" data-base62-sha1=\"uQf1BLLB5qkgd3Hu5lrg26qPLR3\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d8290600de21b7d8ad4175f4f3cd38395e8b6c5d_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d8290600de21b7d8ad4175f4f3cd38395e8b6c5d_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d8290600de21b7d8ad4175f4f3cd38395e8b6c5d_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F4F5F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>During the STIP period from November 3 to March 29, 2024, Arbitrum experienced remarkable growth in both Total Value Locked (TVL) and Daily Active Users (DAU).</p>\n<p>The TVL on Arbitrum increased by more than $1.31 billion, surpassing the combined nominal growth on Optimism and Base. Notably, protocols supported by the STIP collectively realized a 118.2% increase in TVL over the same period, constituting approximately 75.8% of the total TVL growth on Arbitrum. In contrast, non-STIP protocols on Arbitrum collectively increased their TVL by 35.6%, underscoring the significant outperformance of STIP grantees, whose TVL growth surpassed that of non-STIP projects by 82.6 percentage points.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum saw a notable 76.4% increase in DAU, adding around 94,000 new daily users. While Base experienced a larger surge of 136,000 DAU and surpassed Arbitrum, Arbitrum still outpaced Optimism by approximately 46,000 users.</p>\n<p>An essential gauge for assessing the effectiveness of the STIP incentives is the normalized growth relative to the claimed ARB grants. When applying individual cut-off dates to account for each protocol’s initial incentive distributions, STIP grantees collectively generated $13.95 in TVL growth for every $1 of ARB incentives claimed and added 37 additional users engaging on a daily basis per 100,000 ARB claimed. Excluding Galxe, this figure rises to 57 additional users.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"transaction-count-and-fees-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#transaction-count-and-fees-5\"></a>Transaction Count and Fees</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ih8y4okd5UBBbW8nG8KiBjeq31E.png?dl=1\" title=\"|624x351.33365019011404\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"|624x351.33365019011404\" data-base62-sha1=\"ih8y4okd5UBBbW8nG8KiBjeq31E\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/801712a50c238ce4a53b2febc5855dba5d0f4362_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F4F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The transaction volume on Arbitrum increased by 101.9%, exceeding 1 million transactions per day by the end of the STIP. While this increase of over 577,000 transactions outpaced Optimism in nominal growth, it slightly underperformed Base by approximately 14,000 transactions. In December, the Arbitrum One sequencer experienced a brief outage, resulting in a backlog of transactions. Upon restoration, the network processed an all-time high of over 5 million transactions, briefly elevating transaction counts and fee metrics. Subsequently, transaction volumes began to rise again in March, coinciding with the network’s introduction of blob transactions, which notably reduced user transaction fees paid in ETH.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"efficacy-across-verticals-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#efficacy-across-verticals-6\"></a>Efficacy Across Verticals</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"key-takeaways-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-takeaways-7\"></a>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pendle outperformed all grantees in TVL growth, gaining an incremental $150.01 per ARB claimed.</li>\n<li>Balancer demonstrated the highest efficiency in increasing daily user activity relative to claimed ARB</li>\n<li>Gamma stood out as the leader in annualized fee growth relative to claimed ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"tvl-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tvl-8\"></a>TVL</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hBdxXgjKAuzcKqnl3KzFzWkF71I.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hBdxXgjKAuzcKqnl3KzFzWkF71I\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7b59ff5ddaebc574f07be8093fa869a2f16a147e_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF0F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Among the DeFi verticals, the yield category emerged as the frontrunner in TVL growth, increasing by 647.5%.

Normalized by claimed ARB, this growth equates to an additional $2.61 in TVL. Notably, perpetuals have shown to be six times less efficient in attracting TVL through incentives compared to the DEX category, reflecting differing incentive structures. Perpetuals incentivize traders directly through volume-based incentives or trading fee rebates, while DEXs focus solely on incentivizing liquidity providers.</p>\n<p>Vertex emerged as a standout performer within the perpetuals category, contributing to 66% of the nominal TVL growth. Moreover, Vertex demonstrated superior efficiency in increasing TVL with incentives, being at least 5 times more effective than other protocols within the perpetuals category.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that GMX’s ARB grant was utilized to incentivize the adoption of GMX V2. By the end of the STIP, GMX V2’s share of the protocol’s TVL increased from 20% to 68%, indicating a successful migration of liquidity from V1 to V2. Normalized, this $217 million increase in TVL for GMX V2 translates to an additional $11.30 per dollar of ARB claimed, positioning GMX V2 as a close contender to Vertex in terms of incentive-driven TVL growth.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"fees-and-volume-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#fees-and-volume-21\"></a>Fees and Volume</h4>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qkVcs4uw5PZ3PhVeyzEvdmXIoro.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"qkVcs4uw5PZ3PhVeyzEvdmXIoro\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b895fcbf18718ed8c06b7c2f255cf8ff792e5052_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F4F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The perpetuals category realized a $102.3M increase in annualized fees compared to the pre-incentive figures.

Through examining a range of KPIs, it’s evident that STIP-supported projects have made substantial strides in enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem’s vitality and growth.</p>\n<p>One of the most notable observations is the outperformance of STIP grantees compared to non-STIP protocols. Protocols supported by the STIP accounted for 75.8% of the nominal TVL growth on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, vertical analysis revealed nuanced trends within different sectors. While the DEX category demonstrated the highest efficiency in attracting new users relative to incentives claimed, the lending category led in efficiency for attracting TVL. Additionally, perpetuals showed lower efficiency in attracting TVL compared to DEXs but demonstrated the highest efficiency in increasing trading volume.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the findings from the STIP highlight the pivotal role of incentives in fostering ecosystem development and user engagement on Arbitrum. Moving forward, continued assessment and refinement of incentive mechanisms will be crucial in sustaining growth momentum and ensuring the long-term success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"about-openblock-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#about-openblock-23\"></a>About OpenBlock</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://openblocklabs.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenBlock</a> is a data-driven platform dedicated to incentive engineering, fostering sustainable growth within decentralized protocols.

This company is being built by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattFiebach\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Matt Fiebach</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swmartin19\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sam Martin</a>, and bootstrapped with the help of the Arbitrum Foundation as a grant recipient.</p>\n<p>We were the first two employees at <a href=\"https://www.blockworksresearch.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockworks Research</a>, where we built a Saas-based research product offering deep investment insights to institutional crypto investors via long-form research, onchain analytics, and a governance screener. Matt spearheaded the services and governance operations, while Sam focused on the product and day-to-day operations. We scaled a team from 0 to 14 people, grew a daily newsletter and a twitter/X account to 10’s of thousands of readers/followers, launched and hosted the 0xResearch podcast, and more. We have developed vast networks within the crypto industry, and plan to leverage that network and experience to help the Arbitrum DAO operate more efficiently, effectively, and professionally.</p>\n<p>We have identified some pain points within Arbitrum DAO through our experience working directly with the DAO over the past year. Some of these problems include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>● DAO Alignment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO does not have a neutral party to broker proposals, ensure high quality RFP applicants, and generally serve as the steward for proposals. The DAO doesn’t know the ulterior motives and incentives of proposal authors, and there is often a lack of alignment between both of these entities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Collective Action Problem &amp; Proposal Stalemate</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Situations where there is a recognized need or solution that would benefit the broader ecosystem, but individual actors lack sufficient incentives to take action due to asymmetric benefits/costs. There is a lack of dedicated resources to execute strategies and see them through the lifecycle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Procuring &amp; Maintaining Contributors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Arbitrum DAO has trouble attracting full-time, high quality talent given its lack of ability to hire/employ these individuals. There is no incentive to be a full-time DAO contributor. Even with economic incentives (eg ARDC,) many of the top businesses within the industry at their respective specialty miss on these opportunities simply because they are unaware of the opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Strategic Partner Onboarding &amp; Growth</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Arbitrum DAO primarily relies on the Foundation as its BD arm, but having an additional Arbitrum aligned entity to assist in finding strategic partners could yield a richer set of partners to choose from.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>● Stakeholder Relations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information pipelines are broken between key stakeholders of the Arbitrum network including the Delegates, Protocols, the Foundation, Offchain Labs, and other service providers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We started Entropy Advisors to alleviate some of these problems within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This list is non-exhaustive, and we would love to know if the community sees any pain points that Entropy could help solve.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Firstly, our product addresses the pressing need for high, stable and sustainable yield opportunities in the institutional DeFi space. We provide diversified yields sourced from real-world private credit assets, akin to MakerDAO’s approach with RWA. This strategy is poised to attract larger risk-averse DAO treasuries, offering yields derived from real-world assets, which presents a less volatile alternative to yields based on token emissions. Additionally, these yields are stable due to the lack of correlation of returns with both crypto assets and traditional public market risky assets such as equities and bonds, further enhancing their appeal to institutional investors seeking reliable investment options.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we are poised to drive significant innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Our proprietary Credit Analytics platform processes millions of loan data points, providing real-time credit and fraud insights, backed by six years of proprietary data from various lending sectors in Southeast Asia. With the unique position of being the sole RWA private credit platform with a track record of 6 years, we are able to leverage extensive loan data to incorporate machine learning for accurate default prediction, enhancing our private credit deal origination at HELIX for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, as we scale beyond Southeast Asia and APAC, where we are sourcing our immediate set of highly curated deals leveraging Helicap’s deal origination capabilities, we have a planned decentralized credit approver mechanism that will continue to ensure the quality of deals brought onto the platform. These credit approvers will not be random token holders; instead, they will comprise a thoroughly vetted panel of global credit institutions and individual credit professionals like CPAs and CFAs with a proven track record in the private credit space. They will be incentivized to perform credit due diligence. Leveraging HELIX’s proprietary credit analytics and other aspects of each deal, they will provide detailed credit memos. A deal will only be made available to lenders on the platform if a majority of the Credit Approvers have approved it. We envision that these approvers will be akin to real-world credit agencies such as S&amp;P, Moody’s, and Fitch, where no single loan is approved by just one agency but by multiple agencies. Moreover, these approvers can be integrated with other future private credit protocols, enhancing their composability and utility.</p>\n<p>Fourthly, as HELIX is targeting institutions, this will not only enhance the reputation of Arbitrum as an institutional-grade Layer 2 solution but also secure more sticky and long-term TVL that doesn’t dissipate like retail investments in a bear market.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we are looking to address financial inclusion in emerging markets. These loans will support borrowers in underserved sectors such as consumer, agriculture, education, and SMEs, generating meaningful real-world changes.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Our strategies are designed to maximize returns by balancing risk and reward efficiently, drawing on our team’s deep expertise in hedge fund management and derivatives, and institutional grade infrastructure.</p>\n<p>From the Arbitrum perspective, the strong competitive advantage of our ARB++ managed strategy over other proposals is that it doesn’t require the Foundation to sell any ARB, which may be less optimal from an optics standpoint, while also driving additional ARB token volume throughout the ecosystem as collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Yield:</strong><br>\nD2 Finance’s approach to generating risk adjusted returns is deeply rooted in sophisticated active trading strategies, similar to those utilized by market makers and asset management firms. These strategies are inherently subject to market volatility and are designed to capitalize on this volatility to achieve a positive expected value (EV) over the long term. Thus we do not advertise a base yield at the start of an epoch; instead, our yield is dynamically generated based on the performance of our active trading strategies.</p>\n<p>D2 brings the sophistication of a top tier hedge fund, 100% on-chain, 100% non-custodial</p>\n<p><strong>ETH++ Strategy:</strong> 84.3% ROI (247% annualized) since inception 22 Dec 2023.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>We have created a digital asset security that represents a share of a regulated money market mutual fund. The Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, also known as the BENJI token, provides an opportunity for Arbitrum to practice sound treasury management while also generating attractive income. The BENJI token is a competitive solution for Treasury fund diversification, while also acting as an additional source of income generation through competitive yield. Any income generated by investing in the BENJI token can provide additional capital to aid in the development of new products, technology, or other initiatives deemed important to Arbitrum’s DAO.</p>\n<p>This on-chain money market mutual fund, the BENJI token, is designed to provide transparency by using blockchain technology to process transactions and record share ownership. The fund’s transfer agent maintains the official record of share ownership via a proprietary blockchain-integrated system that utilizes a public blockchain for recording transactional activity, known as the Benji platform. Ensuring the safety and stability of a DAO’s Treasury is of the utmost importance and, as a result, many invest in stablecoins to try to preserve capital. Stablecoin providers invest the underlying assets across many different investment types to generate return but rarely pass that return onto holders of the stablecoin. In BENJI’s case, we believe that the Arbitrum DAO Treasury can not only receive the benefit of capital preservation but can also earn any income generated from the fund’s holdings. Although the Treasury may be able to accommodate a larger investment than $150mm (a potential of up to $500mm), we would advise allowing the Fund’s size to grow before increasing the allocation.</p>\n<p>As mentioned later in the plan design section, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund invests 99.5% of its total assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash.</p>\n<p>We would like to advocate for the Arbitrum DAO Treasury to liquidate a portion of its reserves and invest in the BENJI token. Please see Appendix 1 – <em>Say Hello to Benji</em> for more information on the Fund and the process for investing.</p>\n<p>The BENJI token represents shares of a government money market mutual fund that’s registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 but performs the transfer agent transaction record-keeping function via public blockchains. It’s important to note that there is no personal identifiable information publicly available on the blockchain, just transaction-level data. Unlike many similar offerings, the Benji platform records transaction records and fund ownership via a public blockchain, which means that the DAO would have increased transparency and assurance that their assets are in good stead. The DAO Treasury can interact with their account at any time using our Benji Institutional interface and provide a look through to their holdings using the Stellar Explorer or the Polygon PoS Chain Explorer.</p>\n<p>Please see below for a preview of our institutional interface supporting the BENJI token.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\"

Identify key management personnel and individual experience. Also include third parties utilized for managing assets and their qualifications.</strong></p>\n<p>The two portfolio managers on this Fund are Shawn Lyons and Johnson Ng, with 27 and 26 years of service, respectively. The portfolio managers seek to build a diversified portfolio of Government securities. Government securities include those issued by government agencies or instrumentalities, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Farm Credit Banks, whose securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Government.</p>\n<p>The portfolio managers make the final security selection decisions, consistent with desired overall risk positioning, and based on relative pricing and trading liquidity. Throughout the portfolio construction process, dedicated risk analysts collaborate with the portfolio managers to identify the level and sources of risk and help determine optimal position sizing.</p>\n<p>We do not utilize third parties for managing assets as investment management functions are managed in-house. However, the Fund utilizes the following third parties for its sub-administrator, custodian and independent registered public accounting firm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sub-administrator:</strong> JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan) has an agreement with FT Services to provide certain sub-administrative services for the Fund. The administrative services provided by JPMorgan include, but are not limited to, certain fund accounting, financial reporting, tax, corporate governance and compliance and legal administration services.</li>\n<li><strong>Custodian:</strong> JPMorgan Chase Bank, at its principal office at 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017-2070, and at the offices of its branches and agencies throughout the world, acts as custodian of the Fund’s assets.</li>\n<li><strong>Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm:</strong> PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 405 Howard Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94105, is the Fund’s independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm audits the financial statements included in the Fund’s Annual Report to shareholders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Describe any previous work by the entity or its officers/key contributors similar to that requested. References are encouraged.</strong></p>\n<p>Franklin Templeton Digital Assets has been engaged in intensive research and technical development within the digital asset ecosystem for the last several years, developing technology platforms and strategy differentiation to help clients achieve their investment goals in this new asset class, all while supporting and investing in digital asset networks. We believe that, in this space, everything is interconnected and thus take a holistic approach to the ecosystem. We have developed blockchain-native expertise and are committed to distinct pillars across the digital asset economy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Digital Assets Technology: Franklin Templeton Digital Assets believes that blockchain technology has the ability to create efficiencies across a variety of business processes, which is why we are building our own blockchain-based technology solutions to support these assets in the investment management space. Our team built a full service blockchain-based technology stack to support a blockchain-enabled money fund, which includes a digital transfer agent platform, digital asset management system, and digital wallet infrastructure.<br>\nIn April 2021, we launched the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to use blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership. In early 2022, we expanded the availability of the Fund through our Benji Investments app and designated the Stellar network’s blockchain as the Fund’s official record of share ownership. In 2023, we further expanded the availability of the Fund to the Polygon blockchain network. Token holders can gain exposure to the Fund in digital wallets through the Benji Investments app or our institutional website, and we believe that eventually these tokens may be interchangeable with the rest of the digital asset ecosystem. The Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund had over US$360 million under management as of March 31, 2024.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Digital Assets Investment Strategies: Franklin Templeton Digital Assets believes that digital assets are frontier risk alternatives™ and have the potential to generate capital appreciation in the long-term. We also believe that, as with many investment types, much of the alpha generation in this space can occur in the early stages. We are engaged in the early stages of the digital assets market and build portfolios of tokens that are listed on exchanges.<br>\nOur team has developed capabilities to invest in early-stage, private blockchain-focused companies. This investment process includes new techniques developed by the team to help expand our opportunity set using proprietary quantamental research methods. Franklin Templeton Digital Assets also invests in listed tokens and has developed new ways of evaluating these digital assets from both a quantitative and fundamental (tokenomics) perspective.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Node Operations: Franklin Templeton believes that it should be a part of the blockchain networks in which we operate. Running validators and providing staking services can have an impact on client portfolios and help drive potential returns, so we have been developing strategies around this exciting capability. We have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019. In 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Has your entity or its officers/key contributors been subject to an enforcement action, criminal action, or defaulted on legal or financial obligations? Please describe the circumstances if so.</strong></p>\n<p>No, with respect to <em>investment-related</em> regulatory matters, during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, neither Franklin Advisers, Inc. (FAV) nor, to the best of its knowledge, its individual <em>advisory affiliates</em> or the Fund* was named as a respondent in any <em>investment-related</em> regulatory or criminal <em>proceedings</em> brought by any U.S. federal or state regulatory agency, <em>foreign financial regulatory authority,</em> or <em>self-regulatory organization.</em> Additionally, to the best of FAV’s knowledge, it has not defaulted on any legal or financial obligations.

Regulatory Summary.</em> In addition, from time to time, FAV and its <em>advisory affiliates</em> receive subpoenas and inquiries, including requests for documents or information, from governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and also are the subject of governmental or regulatory examinations or investigations. <em>Investment-related</em> <em>proceedings</em>, <em>findings</em> or <em>orders</em> resulting from such subpoenas, inquiries, examinations, or investigations, if any, will be reported, to the extent required and permitted by law, on FAV’s Form ADV filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (Italicized terms are as defined on Form ADV.)</p>\n<p>*The “Fund” refers to the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Describe any conflicts of interest for your entity and key personnel.</strong></p>\n<p>Franklin Templeton’s policy is to take all reasonable steps to maintain and operate effective organizational and administrative controls to identify and manage relevant conflicts that may occur between Franklin Templeton and its clients or between multiple clients.</p>\n<p>The following list provides a summary of the main conflicts we have identified and the controls in place to manage such conflicts within the Franklin Templeton group.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Franklin Templeton Seed Money versus Shareholders’ Investment. As part of normal business practice, Franklin Templeton will invest money, initially, at the launch of a fund in order to diversify and attract clients. The policy is that an investment by Franklin Templeton is treated in a manner that is believed to not conflict with the interests of any client.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fairness of Trading Allocation and Order Priority among Clients. Franklin Templeton has trading aggregation, allocation, and best execution policies and procedures that are designed to ensure that all trades are treated in an equitable and fiduciary manner relative to investment objectives. Where there is insufficient liquidity, the allocation policy automatically attributes liquidity proportionately across all client orders. The aggregation and allocation procedures are subject to a regular review.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interfund Trading and Franklin Templeton Funds Purchasing Franklin Templeton Funds. At times, Franklin Templeton may match internal orders of sales and purchases of portfolio securities. This is known as crosses or Interfunds. Some Franklin Templeton funds can also trade units in other Franklin Templeton funds. This process is dealt with in the existing trading system and procedures. The trade is executed at market price with no commissions or spread taken by Franklin Templeton. This activity is regularly reviewed with the goal of ensuring that clients are treated fairly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Research Material and Client Commissions. Franklin Templeton (FT) proprietary research material is not offered to the general public for sale. FT may enter into Client Commission Arrangements (CCAs), whereby FT directs trades to a broker-dealer with the instruction that the executing broker segregate commission in excess of execution costs in a pool which may be used to compensate brokers and other third parties that provide research services or products to FT. FT has established policies and standards that include ongoing monitoring, oversight, and audit controls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Use of Sensitive Data and Non-Public Information. Franklin Templeton has a number of policies and procedures in place that place restrictions on staff use of confidential or non-public information. There are formal reporting and approval procedures to release such information to satisfy Franklin Templeton’s fiduciary obligations to clients and shareholders. These policies and procedures are regularly reviewed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information Barrier among Investment Advisors and Broker-Dealer Relationships. With the goal of ensuring that sensitive decision information cannot be used to the disadvantage of another fund and that confidential information is not shared inappropriately, Franklin Templeton has Information Barrier Compliance Policy and Procedures in place that separate the physical and logistical investment information between different advisor groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Code of Ethics. All Franklin Templeton personnel are bound by a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct which requires staff to conduct themselves with ethics and integrity and to avoid a conflict, particularly where their personal interests (including family members) could interfere with the interests of the firm and/or the client. In addition, Franklin Templeton has a Personal Investments and Insider Trading Policy that requires pre-clearance of personal transactions, including those of the immediate family of staff members who have access to non-public information regarding securities transactions, securities recommendations, or portfolio holding of FT funds or client accounts. Personal transactions of such staff members are regularly monitored, and prescribed sanctions are issued in the event of a breach.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Equitable and Fair Treatment among Clients. At the heart of Franklin Templeton procedures is the requirement to treat clients fairly and equitably in line with the firm’s fiduciary obligations and investment objectives. This includes, but is not limited to, activity such as the allocation of fees and expenses, redemption in kind, and the lending of securities of a fund. Franklin Templeton procedures are regularly reviewed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Investment in Client Securities. At times, Franklin Templeton funds or investors will invest in the securities of a company for which Franklin Templeton serves as investment manager. Such investment decisions made by Franklin Templeton to invest in client securities are always guided by what is in the best interest of the relevant fund, account, or its investors. Investment decisions are regularly reviewed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gifts and Entertainment. Franklin Templeton has adopted strict guidelines regarding what gifts and business entertainment are acceptable. The policy is part of our Code of Ethics, any violation of which may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Side-by-Side Management. Franklin Templeton has implemented “Policies and Procedures for Side-By-Side Management of Registered Investment Companies and Investment Accounts” designed to address potential conflicts of interest that may arise when a portfolio manager or different portfolio managers within a single investment adviser or within a single investment group manage both U.S.-registered funds and other investment accounts or pooled vehicles for other advisory clients.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6.

Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>Fund distributions, which will be automatically reinvested in additional shares, are generally taxable to you as ordinary income, capital gains or some combination of both. Investment company dividends paid to you from interest earned on certain U.S. government securities may be exempt from state and local taxation, subject in some states to minimum investment or reporting requirements that must be met by the Fund.</p>\n<p>Dividend income: Income dividends are generally subject to tax at ordinary rates. Because the Fund invests primarily in debt securities, it is expected that none of the Fund’s income dividends will be qualified dividends subject to reduced rates of taxation to individuals. A return-of-capital distribution is generally not taxable but will reduce the cost basis of your shares, and will result in a higher capital gain or a lower capital loss when you later sell your shares.</p>\n<p>Capital gains: Fund distributions of short-term capital gains are also subject to tax at ordinary rates. Because the Fund is a money market fund, it does not expect to realize and distribute any long-term capital gains on its investments.</p>\n<p>Sales of Fund shares: Because the Fund seeks to maintain a $1.00 per share NAV, sales of its shares will not generally result in a taxable capital gain or loss for federal or state income tax purposes.</p>\n<p>Medicare tax: An additional 3.8% Medicare tax is imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received from the Fund and net gains from redemptions or other taxable dispositions of Fund shares) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent that such person’s “modified adjusted gross income” (in the case of an individual) or “adjusted gross income” (in the case of an estate or trust) exceeds a threshold amount. Any liability for this additional Medicare tax is reported on, and paid with, your federal income tax return.</p>\n<p>Backup withholding: A shareholder may be subject to backup withholding on any distributions of income and capital gains if the shareholder has provided either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, has failed to certify that the shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or has not certified that the shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. State backup withholding may also apply.</p>\n<p>State and local taxes: Distributions of ordinary income and capital gains, if any are generally subject to state and local taxes. However, distributions of ordinary income paid to individual shareholders from interest earned by the Fund on certain U.S. Government obligations may be exempt from state and local income taxation depending on the state. Shareholders should contact their tax advisors with respect to the state and local income tax consequences of investing in the Fund, including whether Fund dividends derived from interest on U.S. government obligations held by the Fund qualify for tax free treatment.</p>\n<p>Non-U.S. investors: Non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. withholding tax at 30% or a lower treaty rate on Fund dividends of ordinary income. Non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. estate tax on the value of their shares. They are subject to special U.S. tax certification requirements to avoid backup withholding, claim any exemptions from withholding and claim any treaty benefits. Exemptions from U.S. withholding tax are generally provided for capital gains realized on the sale of Fund shares, capital gain dividends paid by the Fund from net long-term capital gains, short-term capital gain dividends paid by the Fund from net short-term capital gains and interest-related dividends paid by the Fund from its qualified net interest income from U.S. sources. However, notwithstanding such exemptions from U.S. withholding tax at source, any such dividends and distributions of income and capital gains will be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24% if you fail to properly certify that you are not a U.S. person.</p>\n<p>Other reporting and withholding requirements: Payments to a shareholder that is either a foreign financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity within the meaning of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) may be subject to a 30% withholding tax on income dividends paid by the Fund. The FATCA withholding tax generally can be avoided by such foreign entity if it provides the Fund, and in some cases, the IRS, information concerning the ownership of certain foreign financial accounts or other appropriate certifications or documentation concerning its status under FATCA. The Fund may be required to report certain shareholder account information to the IRS, non-U.S. taxing authorities or other parties to comply with FATCA.</p>\n<p>Other tax information: This discussion of “Distributions and Taxes” is for general information only and is not tax advice. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding your particular circumstances, and about any federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences before making an investment in the Fund. Additional information about the tax consequences of investing in the Fund may be found in the SAI.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>All Fund transactions must be conducted via the Institutional Web Portal.</p>\n<p>You can redeem your shares at any time through the Institutional Web Portal, although redemptions of Fund shares will only be processed during normal business hours on business days.</p>\n<p>As long as your transaction is for $250,000 or less, you can sell your shares via the Institutional Web Portal without a signature guarantee. Institutional investors making redemptions via the Institutional Web Portal will use a submitter/approver process to authorize transactions.</p>\n<p>Redemption proceeds will be sent by electronic funds transfer (ACH or Fed Wire) from your Institutional Web Portal account to your bank account within seven days after we receive your request in proper form.</p>\n<p>Before requesting to have redemption proceeds sent to a bank account, please make sure we have your current bank account information on file.</p>\n<p>If the bank account was added or changed within the last 15 days, you may be required to provide written instructions signed by all Fund account owners, with a signature guarantee for each Fund account owner.</p>\n<p>If we receive your request in proper form prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time, or the regularly scheduled close of the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier, proceeds sent by ACH generally will be available within two to three business days.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>Since the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund is a stable Net Asset Value (NAV) product invested in U.S. government securities, we would not anticipate a situation where the Fund, or its underlying securities, become impaired.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund only buys securities that the investment manager determines present minimal credit risks. The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 calendar days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average life for its portfolio of 120 calendar days or less, and only buys securities that mature or are deemed to mature in 397 calendar days or less.</p>\n<p>The Fund uses the amortized cost method of valuation to seek to maintain a stable $1.00 share price and does not currently intend to impose liquidity fees or redemption gates on Fund redemptions.</p>\n<p>All Fund transactions for institutional customers must be conducted via the Institutional Web Portal.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in question 9 above in the “plan design” section, as long as your transaction is for $250,000 or less, you can sell your shares via the Institutional Web Portal without a signature guarantee. Institutional investors making redemptions via the Institutional Web Portal will use a submitter/approver process to authorize transactions.</p>\n<p>Redemption proceeds will be sent by electronic funds transfer (ACH or Fed Wire) from your Institutional Web Portal account to your bank account within seven days after we receive your request in proper form.</p>\n<p>Before requesting to have redemption proceeds sent to a bank account, please make sure we have your current bank account information on file.</p>\n<p>If the bank account was added or changed within the last 15 days, you may be required to provide written instructions signed by all Fund account owners, with a signature guarantee for each Fund account owner.</p>\n<p>If we receive your request in proper form prior to 1 p.m. Pacific time, or the regularly scheduled close of the New York Stock Exchange, whichever is earlier, proceeds sent by ACH generally will be available within two to three business days.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s transfer agent maintains the official record of share ownership via a proprietary blockchain-integrated system that utilizes features of traditional book-entry form and one or more public blockchain networks. The use of blockchain technology is relatively new and still evolving for mutual funds. Similar to traditional fund recordkeeping systems, all Fund and shareholder records in the blockchain-integrated system are under the full and complete control of the Fund’s transfer agent.</p>\n<p>The recording of Fund shares on the blockchain will not affect the Fund’s investments. The Fund intends to be a Government money market fund. Accordingly, the Fund will invest, consistent with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act, at least 99.5% of its total assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash. The Fund will not invest in any cryptocurrencies (referred to as, among other things, virtual currencies).</p>\n<p>Complex information technology and communications systems, such as blockchain networks, are subject to a number of different threats or risks that could adversely affect the Fund. If such an event occurs, the Fund may incur substantial costs. In addition, market events also may trigger a volume of transactions that overloads current information technology and communication systems and processes, impacting the ability to conduct the Fund’s operations. The Fund may never achieve market acceptance and may not be able to attract sizable assets or achieve scale. The Fund’s investment manager expects that the blockchain-integrated recordkeeping system will provide operational efficiencies without negatively impacting the quality of the transfer agent’s services.</p>\n<p><strong>13.

During the term, the fee waiver and expense reimbursement agreement may not be terminated or amended without approval of the board of trustees except to add series or classes, to reflect the extension of the termination date or to lower the waiver and expense limitation (which would result in lower fees for shareholders).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3.

How many audits have you had and name of auditors? Please provide a copy of reports.</strong></p>\n<p>Our smart contract code has been audited by Trail of Bits as of September 2023.

Is the project permissioned? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, users of the Benji platform are run through typical KYC/AML verification, and are white listed inside the contract (using ERC-20 roles).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross-chain interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund currently uses the Stellar network as the primary public blockchain and Fund investors will initially hold their wallets on the Stellar network. However, the Fund may also use the Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum networks for certain accounts upon request and subject to eligibility, although one or more of those other blockchain networks may not be available at certain times. It’s important to note that we are not live yet for general availability on Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum networks. Please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:FTDigitalAssets@franklintempleton.com\">FTDigitalAssets@franklintempleton.com</a> to determine your eligibility to hold your wallet on a network other than Stellar and the availability of the other network. Approval to hold your wallet on a network other than Stellar is subject to the sole discretion of the Fund and its transfer agent.</p>\n<p>Shares of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund are available for transfer from one shareholder to another shareholder (“peer-to-peer”) on the public blockchain. Transfers within the same network/chain are currently available, but we’re working on the availability of cross-chain transfers.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>During the onboarding process, Franklin Templeton obtains a list of authorized users sanctioned by the client (full know-your-customer/anti-money laundering performed on all entities and entity persons). Franklin Templeton then sends out an invitation to each authorized user that will allow them to establish their username and password and set up multi-factor authentication using Okta Verify and WebAuthn (FIDO2 Compliant Devices - includes Windows Biometrics with TPM, iOS Passkeys onboarded with QR Codes, etc.).</p>\n<p>For internal users, regular access control reviews are completed across all technical services used by the Digital Assets Technology team on a regular basis, or if there is a change in job function. There are varying levels of access based on job function and division of responsibilities as well. Access is granted based on the principle of least privilege, meaning a user is given the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform his/her job functions.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<p>For tracking, no custom logic is required – it’s ERC-20 compatible. Since user-managed wallet functionality is currently disabled, all operational logic (such as creating purchases and liquidations) has to go through our Institutional Website. There are additional custom functions available such as querying pending transactions.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Supplementary</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

The Fund is a “professional fund” within the meaning of the Securities and Investment Business Act, 2010 (“SIBA”) and accordingly Shares in the Fund are only being offered to and will only be issued to “professional investors” within the meaning of SIBA.</p>\n<p>The Articles are governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands. The Subscription Documents relating to the Fund are governed by the laws of the state of Delaware. The Subscription Documents provide for disputes to be determined by the courts of the Supreme Court, State of New York, New York County and of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>US Regulatory: The Fund is not registered as an investment company and, therefore, is not required to adhere to certain investment policies under the Company Act in reliance on the exemption provided in Section 3(c)(7) of the Company Act with respect to offers made to U.S. persons. As part of the Fund’s responsibility for the prevention of money laundering, the Fund may require a detailed verification of a Shareholder’s identity, the identity of any beneficial owner underlying an investment in the Fund and the source of payment of such investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Contractual:</strong></p>\n<p>There are three primary legal documents associated with investing in BUIDL:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Master Subscription Agreement (“MSA”) (signature required)</li>\n<li>Fund Subscription Agreement (“FSA”) (signature required)</li>\n<li>Private Placement Memorandum (“PPM”) (for reference only)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both the MSA and FSA require investor signature prior to investing; the PPM does not.</p>\n<p>The MSA and FSA are binding agreements. They request information and representations from the investor to determine eligibility for investing in the Fund. They also outline the terms of the Fund that the investor must accept in order to invest. These documents need to be signed by legal signers or authorized representatives of the legal entity/Foundation/DAO (likely multiple individuals).

If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. The transfer agent issues securities at the direction of the issuer and does not own or custody the assets. Should Securitize enter bankruptcy, the role of transfer agent could be transitioned to another provider who could redeem shares with the fund. The fund could also decide to close and return funds to shareholders if a successor transfer agent could not be engaged.</p>\n<p><strong>5.\tHow are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-à-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>The custodial relationship of the fund with BNY Mellon is covered under the U.S. Securities Investor Protection Act.</p>\n<p><strong>6.\tDoes the Issuer issue more than one asset?

Additionally, BUIDL shareholders may also be able to directly sell their shares on the secondary market to Circle in exchange for USDC (more detail below).</p>\n<p>The Fund currently cannot accept ARB tokens for subscription, or utilize ARB in the existing secondary market transaction flow; therefore, the investor must manage any conversion of ARB → USD before the subscription flow or conversion from USD/USDC → ARB after exit from the Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>USD Subscription:</strong></p>\n<p>For subscription into BUIDL, the investor must first complete onboarding with Securitize.  This includes all KYC/B requirements for approval into the fund. Once approved, the investor will sign the BUIDL subscription agreement and will be provided with USD funding instructions via the Securitize platform UI.

U.S. taxable investors will also receive PFIC statements.</p>\n<p>There can be no assurance that the U.S. or British Virgin Islands tax laws, or revenue authority practice, will not be changed adversely with respect to the Fund and its Shareholders or that the Fund’s income tax status will not be successfully challenged by such authorities.</p>\n<p>Potential Shareholders should consult their own advisors regarding tax treatment by the jurisdiction applicable to them. Shareholders should rely only upon advice received from their own tax advisors based upon their own individual circumstances and the laws applicable to them.</p>\n<p><strong>9.\tDescribe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>Generally, Shareholders will have the right to redeem all or any portion of their Shares on each Business Day in exchange for U.S. dollars as described below.</p>\n<p>Requests for USD redemptions must be received in good order by the Transfer Agent between 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. New York time on the applicable Redemption Date. In order for a redemption request to be treated as having been received in good order as of a Redemption Date, (i) the Shares to be redeemed must be moved to the Transfer Agent’s wallet on the blockchain and (ii) such transfer must be reflected on the Fund’s books and records, in each case by the applicable deadline.

If such Shareholder does not actually submit such a redemption request, it will be deemed to have submitted a redemption request with respect to any Shares that it moves to the Transfer Agent’s wallet. The Transfer Agent will not consider Shares to have been moved to its wallet until after it determines that the transaction is “final.” The Transfer Agent will consider a transaction final only after (a) the transaction has been included in a block published to the blockchain and (b) a sufficient number of additional blocks have been added to the same chain as determined by the Transfer Agent.

What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>All shares of the fund are the same, so there is no first-loss equity. All shares are impacted equally.</p>\n<p><strong>11.   Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Liquidity and stability of underlying assets:</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund invests 100% of its total assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, notes or other obligations that mature in three months or less from the settlement of the purchase in both the primary and secondary markets.</p>\n<p>U.S. Treasury bills are understood to be a stable investment, given their deep and liquid trading market and due to being backed by the U.S. government. This significantly limits the risk of default. More information about the underlying assets and current holdings are described in the plan design section above.</p>\n<p><strong>Settlement:</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the reliance on some traditional banking / fiat systems and processes, there are some time constraints to redemptions and settlement. Generally, Shareholders will have the right to redeem all or any portion of their Shares on each Business Day in exchange for U.S. dollars as described below.</p>\n<p>Investors may redeem directly with the Fund to receive USD via wire transfer. Redemptions will be paid via USD wire transfer to the bank account stored on the records of the Transfer Agent.  Redemptions are initiated by sending tokens to the redemption wallet, which can be facilitated through the Securitize platform UI or by directly sending tokens to the redemption wallet.  Tokens must be received into the records of the Transfer Agent by the cutoff time (3:00 PM ET) for same day processing of the wire payment.  Redemptions received after the cutoff time will be paid during the next operating day of the fund. More information about the detailed description of the redemption process can be found in the question above.</p>\n<p>Payment of redemption proceeds will generally be made on the applicable Redemption Date, provided that payment details have already been provided to the Transfer Agent. Redemption proceeds for Shares generally will be paid in U.S. dollars. Redemption proceeds will only be paid to the account of record in the name of the Shareholder.</p>\n<p>BUIDL holders may engage directly with Circle in a secondary market transaction to exit their BUIDL position, in which a smart contract facilitates a 1:1 atomic swap of BUIDL for USDC.  This secondary market is available 24/7/365 (at the sole discretion of Circle and is not guaranteed)and transactions can be facilitated through the Securitize platform UI, or by directly interacting with smart contracts. The smart contract facilitates the exchange by sending USDC to the sending address of the BUIDL tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>12.   If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>Risks resulting from blockchain operations can include the investors’ risk of loss or accessibility to the asset. This can happen for a variety of reasons not limited to a private key being lost or compromised. The Transfer Agent can perform functions to return ownership of the lost asset to a new wallet. Any instance of security vulnerability or access loss should be reported to the Transfer Agent immediately for investigation and remediation. Typically, this would involve any necessary identity verification followed by procedures to burn the compromised tokens and re-issue (mint) to a new wallet address chosen by the investor.</p>\n<p><strong>13.   Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps, OTC agreements)?</strong></p>\n<p>The fund does not invest in derivative products such as swaps or over-the-counter (OTC) agreements. Instead, it invests in cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations or cash. It also invests in government money market funds that adhere to similar investment criteria, emphasizing direct and straightforward investments rather than derivatives. (See “Underlying asset”).</p>\n<p><strong>14.

If the fund invests in any BlackRock-managed money market funds, the Unitary Fee will be decreased by the amount of any fees and expenses of these funds that the main fund bears.</p>\n<p><strong>3.\tDescribe frequency of fee payment and its position vis-a-vis payment priority compared with other expenses (i.e., cash waterfall)</strong></p>\n<p>The fee is taken from the fund’s net investment income that would otherwise be paid to the Shareholder. If the fund’s net income on any given day is less than the fee due, the fee will be reduced so that it does not exceed the day’s net income. This fee is calculated daily for each Shareholder.</p>\n<p>Any amount of the Unitary Fee that exceeds the fund’s monthly costs (such as organizational, offering, operational expenses, and any fees and expenses related to administration and custody, as well as any fund indemnification obligations) will be paid monthly to the investment manager as per the management agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract/Architecture</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.\tHow many audits have you had and name of auditors?

Securitize is also a SOC1 compliant organization.</p>\n<p>The smart contract code for BUIDL has also been reviewed in detail by several partners as part of the launch, including one partner who has conducted an independent audit. Additionally, Halborn audited the USDC &lt;&gt; BUIDL swap smart contract.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\tIs the project permissioned? If so, how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>The project is permissioned. Primary and Secondary trading are limited to whitelisted investors passing a KYC/AML onboarding process.</p>\n<p>Each person seeking to invest in the shares must be, among other things, (i) an “accredited investor” and (ii) either (x) a “qualified purchaser” or a “knowledgeable employee,” in each case as defined under applicable U.S. federal securities laws or (y) a non-U.S. person that is outside of the United States at the time it acquires Shares.</p>\n<p>Each prospective Shareholder will be required to agree that no shares, nor any interest therein, will be transferred (other than to a Whitelisted Account) without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>The Transfer Agent operates a “whitelist” comprising investors or prospective investors who are allowed to subscribe for or acquire shares from Shareholders without needing further suitability checks or anti-money laundering verifications. Transfers between these accounts are generally allowed at any time, even when the Fund isn’t accepting new subscriptions or redemptions, providing flexibility within a controlled environment.</p>\n<p>The Transfer Agent controls the permissions for whitelisting through operations that require the usage of keys that are managed via multi-permission processes using Fireblocks.

Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol enables fixed-rate, fixed-term collateralized loans of cryptoassets, including RWAs for the assets being lent or serving as collateral. The Protocol solves the extreme volatility and rapidly increasing rates in variable rate DeFi markets, which make financing unpredictable and costly for borrowers. Isolated lending pools also enable quick adoption of new collateral types to respond to a rapidly changing market without additional risk to its users.</p>\n<p>The Protocol’s innovative characteristics include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single-Price Sealed Bid Auction Instead of AMM: Instead of using an AMM, Term introduces an innovative auction mechanism that matches lenders and borrowers at a single fixed rate, eliminating slippage and spread issues common in other DeFi lending models.</li>\n<li>Fixed-Rate, Fixed-Term Lending at Scale: Offers stability and scalability in a market known for extreme volatility, enabling both individual and institutional participants to manage and execute financial strategies at scale with predictability.</li>\n<li>Permissioned RWAs: Term is able to support the onboarding of permissioned RWAs as collateral. Term has successfully completed multiple pilot auctions in partnership with Matrixport and their STBT token.</li>\n<li>Isolated Collateral Pools: Each loan is backed by its own segregated collateral pool, enhancing protocol security and enabling customized loan terms and rapid onboarding of new collateral types onto the protocol.</li>\n<li>Capital Efficiency: Unmatched funds are immediately returned to lenders, optimizing capital efficiency and eliminating idle assets.</li>\n<li>Customizable Loan Features for a Variety of Needs: Supports diverse financial needs rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach by allowing customization of loan terms, oracles, and tokens, catering to a wide range of borrowing and lending needs.</li>\n<li>Dynamic Liquidations: Implements an innovative dynamic / soft liquidation mechanism that limits liquidations to the point that take the borrower back to their initial margin ratio - neither too much nor too little.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor or similar rights?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and transparent. Lenders on the Protocol are protected through a collateral liquidation mechanism, specifically an innovative dynamic / soft mechanism that limits liquidations to the point that take the borrower back to their initial margin ratio—neither too much nor too little.</p>\n<p>In addition, each loan is a separate smart contract deployment, which enables isolated collateral pools that reduce the risk of contagion and allows the Protocol to onboard a wider range of collateral types (including RWAs).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is a decentralized collection of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum mainnet and Avalanche (and is expected to be deployed on additional chains, including Arbitrum).</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes—the Protocol is noncustodial and neither Term Foundation nor any entity or person other than Protocol users themselves own the assets being lent or serving as collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>Because the Protocol is entirely onchain, Arbitrum’s assets are not exposed to any brokerage or financial institution.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is not an issuer. However, as described above, the Protocol supports a wide variety of cryptoassets for lending and collateral (including RWAs). Lenders with a specific collateral pool are pari passu with respect to any haircuts due to bad debt.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a detailed cash flow diagram that shows the flow of funds from ARB/Fiat conversion, investment in underlying asset, payment of expenses, sale of underlying asset, and repayment (Fiat/ARB conversion), including the counterparties and legal jurisdictions involved.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ARB is converted to a supported cryptoasset (e.g., USDC or a tokenized RWA).</li>\n<li>The cryptoasset being lent is then used to make loan offers in Protocol auctions or placed in a vault or smart contract that does so.</li>\n<li>As loans mature, the proceeds are collected and either retained or rolled into new auctions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above flow is entirely onchain. The only counterparties are Protocol users borrowing in auctions.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>The yield received would likely be considered interest received on a loan. Although the Protocol’s interface geoblocks the U.S. and does not permit U.S. users, the tax treatment in the U.S. may be instructive—loan interest is typically taxed as ordinary income at the federal level.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>Outstanding loans may either be held through maturity or a buyer can be found for the tokens that represent the right to claim loan repayments.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>As explained above, the Protocol socializes losses across all lenders in a specific isolated collateral pool on a pari passu basis.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p>As described above, outstanding loans may either be held through maturity or a buyer can be found for the tokens that represent the right to claim loan repayments. Under these circumstances liquidity depends on factors such as length to maturity. Loan terms are typically 4 weeks and 4 week ladders can be constructed to have weekly liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and has undergone significant real-use and audit testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its smart contracts have undergone multiple security audits with reputable firms like Sigma Prime, Dedaub, and Runtime Verification.</li>\n<li>It has undergone formal verification using Certora’s prover with thorough protocol coverage (over 200 rules and invariants verified).</li>\n<li>It has achieved a 93% rating from DefiSafey for access controls, audit process, and overall protocol monitoring procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>13. Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps,OTC agreements?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>14. List all the third party counterparties linked to your assets including and not restricted to prime broker if any, custodian, reporting agent, banks for derivatives or loans and provide primary contact details for the third party counterparties</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is noncustodial and neither Term Foundation nor any entity or person other than Protocol users themselves own the assets being lent or serving as collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>15. Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s contributors carefully evaluate new cryptoassets being considered. Factors consider for onboarding collateral assets include 1) Reputable Oracles 2) deep onchain liquidity 3) other factors e.g. withdrawal queues also taken into account.</p>\n<h2>Performance reporting</h2>\n<p><strong>1. What are your proposed performance benchmarks? If this is substantially different from the underlying assets, please explain why.</strong></p>\n<p>Performance should be benchmarked in an asset-specific manner to other lending protocols, such as Aave. Because the Protocol is entirely onchain, performance can be tracked onchain in a transparent manner.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the content, format, preparation process, and cadence of performance reports. This should include proof of reserves, if appropriate. Please include a sample report.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s developers would be able to generate performance reports in a manner to be agreed upon.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Who provides the performance reports in respect of the underlying assets?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s developers.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe any formal audit process and timing of such audits.</strong></p>\n<p>Because the Protocol is entirely onchain, it does not need to undergo financial audits.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Provide a copy of your standard contract, or one similar to what is being proposed here.</strong></p>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<p><strong>2. Fee summary: Inclusive of the full scope of services requested. Product Fee schedule If asset based Fee calculation for our plan if asset based Annual fee if flat fee Any other fees (including redemption or minting fees)</strong></p>\n<p>Protocol users are subject to two types of fees: a loan servicing fee and liquidated damages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Servicing Fee: Borrowers are charged a loan servicing fee, typically ranging from 0.25%-0.50% per annum on the amount borrowed through Term. The servicing fee is a fee earned by the protocol for processing loans, maintaining records, and monitoring collateral. The fee is quoted as an annualized rate applied to and deducted from any loan proceeds obtained as a result of a successful bid by a borrower.</li>\n<li>Protocol Liquidation Fees: Borrowers in default are subject to liquidated damages (a surcharge), which is applied to any debt covered in liquidation and collected in collateral tokens. Liquidated damages are split between liquidators (typically 5.2%) as a liquidation incentive and the Protocol (Protocol liquidated damages, typically set at 2.8%).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Describe frequency of fee payment and its position vis-a-vis payment priority compared with other expenses (i.e., cash waterfall)</strong></p>\n<p>Servicing fees are paid by the borrower upon disbursement of loan proceeds to a borrower in an auction.</p>\n<h2>Smart Contract/Architecture</h2>\n<p><strong>1. How many audits have you had and name of auditors? Please provide a copy of reports.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and has undergone significant real-use and audit testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its smart contracts have undergone multiple security audits with reputable firms like <a href=\"https://developers.term.finance/deployed-contracts/smart-contract-audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sigma Prime, Dedaub, and Runtime Verification</a>.</li>\n<li>It has undergone <a href=\"https://developers.term.finance/deployed-contracts/formal-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">formal verification using Certora’s prover</a> with thorough protocol coverage (over 200 rules and invariants verified).</li>\n<li>It has achieved a <a href=\"https://defisafety.com/app/pqrs/576\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">93% rating from Defi Safey</a> for access controls, audit process, and overall protocol monitoring procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Is the project permissioned? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol can operate in both a permissionless and permissioned manner. For example, the Protocol has a partnership with Matrixport to enable fixed-rate lending against permissioned RWAs. In permissioned assets the protocol also onboards whitelisted liquidators to ensure orderly liquidations. User identities are typically managed through the RWA partner/project’s process.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross chain interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is current available on Ethereum mainnet and Avalanche, with additional chains to be added in the coming months. At the moment there are no cross-chain interactions, but they are being evaluated.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol itself does not have its own RWA tokens. Instead, RWA tokens from other projects can be lent or used as collateral in either a permissioned or permissionless manner.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and lending operates through smart contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol itself does not have its own RWA tokens. Instead, RWA tokens from other projects can be lent or used as collateral in either a permissioned or permissionless manner.</p>\n<h2>Supplementary</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

As an asset that accumulates value and is denominated in USD, mTBILL enables users to borrow traditional stablecoins with higher-than-average loan-to-value ratios while minimizing liquidation risk.<br>\nThis arrangement promotes an influx of stable capital into Arbitrum lending protocols, attracting users seeking favorable rates in the current market environment.</p>\n<p>In isolated pool models, mTBILL enhances interest rates for lenders and borrowers, narrows the rate spread, and offers a method for mitigating bad debt as the collateral asset appreciates. As a permissionless ERC-20 token, mTBILL can be transferred seamlessly in the case of loan default. In single-pool structures, mTBILL can improve rate spreads and boost supply-side yields for traditional stablecoins like DAI, USDC, and USDT.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"capital-commitment-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#capital-commitment-10\"></a><strong>Capital commitment</strong></h4>\n<p>Midas has established an impressive network of investors and co-allocators, including, but not limited to: BlockTower, Framework Ventures, and GSR, who are aligned to utilize and grow the adoption of mTBILL and RWA assets that Midas issues on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>These partners plan to work in concert with Midas to create new opportunities within Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem by providing liquidity in protocols and creating new opportunities for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. We anticipate the activity will create a network effect within the Arbitrum ecosystem, contributing to its long-term growth and success.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"capital-preservation-accumulation-for-the-arbitrum-dao-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#capital-preservation-accumulation-for-the-arbitrum-dao-11\"></a><strong>Capital Preservation &amp; Accumulation for the Arbitrum DAO</strong></h4>\n<p>The investment from the Arbitrum DAO into tokenized treasuries such as Midas mTBILL safeguards the foundation’s financial stability and fosters growth, while also playing a pivotal role in advancing the real-world asset (RWA) ecosystem on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>By leveraging mTBILL, which utilises strategies akin to corporate treasury management, the foundation can diversify its assets and achieve stable financial returns without compromising liquidity or incurring high risk. Simultaneously, this investment enhances the security and stability of the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting its development and resilience against market volatility by integrating real-world financial mechanisms into the blockchain environment.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Arbitrum stands to gain from Midas’s robust legal and regulatory framework used to issue mTBILL, details of which we will explore later in this proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

How many of these assets held are present on Arbitrum One, if any?</strong></p>\n<p>None at present, but we intend to deploy on Arbitrum natively, growing mTBILL’s TVL and fostering ecosystem adoption within Arbitrum expected by the end of Q3.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"plan-design-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#plan-design-13\"></a>Plan design</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed product, Midas mTBILL, is a regulatory-compliant security token that offers investors on-chain exposure to yield from US Treasury Bills (T-Bills), specifically through the iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF managed by BlackRock. This ETF is comprised of short-dated US Treasury Bills, targeting a maturity mix of 0-1 year to minimize interest rate risk while providing a stable return.</p>\n<p>Given that US T-Bills are backed by the credit of the United States government, the credit quality of the underlying assets is among the highest. The product is designed to 1:1 track the performance of its underlying assets, offering both safety and yield onchain.</p>\n<p>Relevant attachments are included via email.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor, or similar rights?</strong></p>\n<p>mTBILL is a placement of a secured credit by the issuing SPV Midas Software GmbH.</p>\n<p>Investors in mTBILL gain exposure to the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying ETF, ensuring a claim to the financial returns generated from the US Treasury Bills. No shareholder or voting rights are associated with mTBILL.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>Midas mTBILL is issued under German law by Midas Software GmbH, structured as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to ensure compliance with the European Securities Regulation and Anti-Money Laundering law. Midas mTBILL is a secured loan issued by Midas Software GmbH to investors during token issuance. The asset tracks the value of the underlying Blackrock iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF (IB01).</p>\n<p>This setup adheres to regulations in multiple jurisdictions, with specific exclusions for US, China, sanctioned countries, and UK retail investors.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third-party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Arbitrum’s assets invested in mTBILL are bankruptcy remote due to the legal and contractual design involving an SPV (Midas Software GmbH) and the secure custody of assets by regulated custodians (e.g., Maerki Baumann).</p>\n<p>A security agent (e.g., ATG Azimut Treuhandgesellschaft mbH) acts on behalf of investors to ensure the segregation and protection of assets. This structure is established under German and Swiss law, providing a strong legal basis for asset protection against bankruptcy or adverse events affecting Midas.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The fund shares backing mTBILL are securely ring-fenced and held by a qualified custodian, assuring asset protection in the unlikely event of Midas’ insolvency.</li>\n<li>Assets are held in a segregated brokerage account protected from the custodian’s solvency. Maerki Baumann serves as the licensed Custodian of the assets.</li>\n<li>The appointed security agent acts as trustee to token holders ensuring bankruptcy remoteness. ATG Azimut Treuhandgesellschaft mbH acts as the Security Agent on behalf of investors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>No, not at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a detailed cash flow diagram that shows the flow of funds from ARB/Fiat conversion, investment in the underlying asset, payment of expenses, sale of the underlying asset, and repayment (Fiat/ARB conversion), including the counterparties and legal jurisdictions involved.</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4a1119ee393490f440cb16a1ac23d28aaed70bd8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/azdYgZ7ZPwvSbHbZsZjhkk2QDQA.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4a1119ee393490f440cb16a1ac23d28aaed70bd8.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"azdYgZ7ZPwvSbHbZsZjhkk2QDQA\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"641\" height=\"500\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F7F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h4><a name=\"outline-flow-of-funds-with-reference-to-fees-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#outline-flow-of-funds-with-reference-to-fees-14\"></a><strong>Outline flow of funds (with reference to fees):</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Midas Software GmbH is the tokenizing entity where assets are ring-fenced and bankruptcy-protected.</li>\n<li>The security agent ATG Treuhand controls assets for Midas Software GmbH and can liquidate and distribute assets at the behest of the investors in the case of a default of the issuing SPV Midas Software GmbH.</li>\n<li>Midas Software GmbH receives investment in the form of fiat or stablecoins from the Arbitrum DAO.\n<ol>\n<li>If stablecoins aside from USDC are transferred, a qualified on-offramp provider converts the funds to USDC before transferring them to Maerki Baumann who then converts the proceeds to fiat.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>After converting to fiat, Maerki utilises the proceeds to acquire and hold BlackRock-managed US Treasury ETFs.</li>\n<li>Upon completion of the underlying purchase, a value-equivalent quantity of mTBILL is minted and sent to the investor’s wallet.\n<ol>\n<li>In the case of a redemption, Maerki sells a value-equivalent quantity of ETF shares.

Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>While the Arbitrum funding provided invaluable support that helped propagate our game, there was a lack of on-chain metrics in terms compared to other protocols due to the off-chain nature of our game. Tales of Elleria is now enhancing on-chain metrics to convert off-chain players to on-chain activity. We’ve now added mechanics to distribute rewards, incentives, and other tokens on-chain, and forcibly made players interact with Arbitrum to access these rewards so we have more representative on-chain metrics to show in the future.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while the Arbitrum funding provided invaluable support, we realized that we needed to create content and other retention mechanics after our two big game partners, DeFi Kingdoms and Spellborne, brought about a wave of new players, to fully capitalize on our growth. Tales of Elleria strategically enriched its content offerings to enhance player retention and achieved a whopping 91% monthly retention ratio the month after STIP.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7.

This support provided the essential foundation for our goals, allowing us to innovate and grow in ways we couldn’t have imagined otherwise. However, alongside the grant, we recognized the need to invest additional effort in crafting compelling content with our partners to ensure player retention and engagement. This combination of financial backing, proactive content creation, and partnered project support proved to be a winning formula, resulting in significant achievements for our project.</p>\n<p>Throughout the grant period, we witnessed remarkable strides forward. Notably, our collaborative events with DeFi Kingdoms and Spellborne garnered outstanding success. These partnerships not only expanded our reach but also retained users. The tangible outcomes, including substantial increases in player count, transaction count, and fee generation, underscore the effectiveness of the grant in driving our project’s success. As we reflect on these achievements, we’re inspired to continue our growth of Tales of Elleria.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tales-of-elleria-program-update/23633\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tales-of-elleria-program-update/23633","pubDate":"Fri, 03 May 2024 15:02:44 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23633"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tales-of-elleria-program-update/23633.rss","#text":"Tales of Elleria Program Update"},"filter":true}]}}}
