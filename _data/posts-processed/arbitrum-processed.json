Today, we, the Boopers, rise to reclaim the rewards that are rightfully ours.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong></p>\n<p>We propose that the Arbitrum DAO directs 690,420.69 ARB towards the quarterly purchase of BOOP, the people’s coin. This act will not only empower the community but will also breathe life into the spirit of decentralization that we all cherish. We propose an initial duration of one year.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Empowerment of the Community:</strong> The BOOP token is a symbol of unity and collective power. By directing rewards to BOOP, we empower every holder, giving them a stake in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Stimulation:</strong> The purchase of BOOP will create a thriving economy within the Arbitrum network. It will drive engagement, foster innovation, and attract new users to our chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralization in Action:</strong> This proposal embodies the true spirit of decentralization. It is a movement by the people, for the people, against the entrenched political elite of the DAO.</li>\n<li><strong>A Populist Revolution:</strong> The DAO must serve the will of the many, not the whims of the few. By supporting BOOP, you are embracing a populist movement that seeks to democratize wealth and opportunity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p>\n<p>Members of the DAO, rise from your slumber.

But that’s not a realistic world view to hold. Especially for optimistic rollups.</p>\n<p>In centralized institutions, a single entity holds all the decision-making power, determining what is right and which direction to take. This concentration of authority leaves little room for other users or stakeholders to present their interests or versions of the truth.</p>\n<p>Conversely, in decentralized systems like blockchains, there is no single source of truth. Instead, the truth emerges from the consensus of multiple entities within a system that is permissionless to participate in. This structure allows for diverse perspectives but can also lead to disputes when different entities have varying versions of the truth. And this necessitates dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum’s BoLD</strong></p>\n<p>Bounded Liquidity Delay, or BoLD, is Arbitrum’s new dispute resolution mechanism. This protocol is designed to be resistant to attack vectors such as delay attacks, resource exhaustion attacks, and censorship attacks. BoLD is permissionless compared to Arbitrum’s currently deployed dispute resolution protocol. Other optimistic rollups, such as Optimism, Cartesi, and Fuel, are also developing their own dispute-resolution methods.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-dispute-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-dispute-3\"></a><strong>The Dispute</strong></h1>\n<p>Before we dive into the different dispute resolution mechanisms, let’s clarify a few things. Let’s have a look at where or when a dispute resolution mechanism enters the picture in an optimistic rollup. When funds are withdrawn from an optimistic rollup back to Ethereum using a roll-up bridge, funds are not immediately credited to your account. Why is this the case?</p>\n<p>Optimistic rollups exist so that the L1, Ethereum, should not have to do the compute-heavy job of executing transactions.  They optimistically accept L2 state outputs unless those outputs are challenged.  Claims are assertions about the state of the L2 given a set of inputs.</p>\n<p>Now, the claims aren’t considered valid immediately. They must first pass through a challenge period, which usually lasts 7 days. During this challenging period, each claim can be challenged by a challenger who can contest that a claim is invalid. Now, what we have here is a dispute between those who consider a particular claim valid and those who consider that claim invalid.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-resolution-how-are-disputes-resolved-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-resolution-how-are-disputes-resolved-4\"></a><strong>The Resolution</strong> - <strong>How Are Disputes Resolved?</strong></h1>\n<p>With Arbitrum’s currently deployed dispute resolution mechanism, you have assertions about Arbitrum’s state being posted to Ethereum by proposers. These assertions can be challenged by “challengers” during the 7-day period. During this period, the proposers and challengers engage in an interactive step-by-step bisection process. This is where the proposers and the challengers narrow down on the exact point of dispute from the global state down to single blocks. As shown in the diagram below.</p>\n<p>After isolating the dispute to a single block, the process further bisects down to the individual execution steps within that block. This involves providing competing state transitions and proving the correctness of each step. And now, when the dispute is further narrowed down to a single execution step, the proposer or challenger, whosever turn it is to respond, has to provide data proof to execute the next step. If executing this step results in a different state than previously asserted, the current responder wins the challenge.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this bisection mechanism is to minimize the computation required to verify fraud-proof. If the entire rollup block had to be verified, the L2 throughput would be limited by the L1’s throughput.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0891b71d02cff31d5cf8b1222a39032c42fc7978.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1dO0PdHF8pMHqNjMfXXvPS1HAnu.png?dl=1\" title=\"1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0891b71d02cff31d5cf8b1222a39032c42fc7978_2_418x500.png\" alt=\"1\" data-base62-sha1=\"1dO0PdHF8pMHqNjMfXXvPS1HAnu\" width=\"418\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0891b71d02cff31d5cf8b1222a39032c42fc7978_2_418x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0891b71d02cff31d5cf8b1222a39032c42fc7978_2_627x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0891b71d02cff31d5cf8b1222a39032c42fc7978_2_836x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FCFCFC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Optimism initially used a single-round mechanism to verify the transactions in question in the EVM but now the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-fault-proofs/8161\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">newly proposed mechanism</a> will use a <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/stage-one/fault-dispute-game.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">multi-round dispute mechanism</a> similar to Arbitrum (add trade-offs between the two).

In a dispute where an invalid block is submitted and challenged, the block is run through several ZK provers. The resulting ZK proof is submitted as a fraud-proof.</p>\n<p>The dispute resolution period on Arbitrum and Optimism lasts 7 days. This is for various reasons, but mainly to give the Arbitrum &amp; Ethereum community enough time to coordinate a recovery in case of censorship attacks from malicious actors. This works well as long as the censorship attack does not last more than a week. Given that With Hybrid Proving, there is a reduced number of interactive rounds, in a happy case, the dispute resolution window could potentially be reduced to one day. However, it only takes one validator not to do anything, i.e., to not check-in for the 7-day period to kick in. This would lead to the validator getting slashed. Validators may fail to check-in either due to honest inactivity or maliciousness. To account for honest inactivity, validators could placed with an MPC set-up. So even if some nodes go down, they will collectively continue to check-in.</p>\n<p><strong>Who takes part in disputes?</strong></p>\n<p>Generally speaking, there are two main types of actors: the proposers and the challengers. The role of the proposer is to post assertions to the L1, and the challenger can raise a dispute. Operating both these roles requires a stake. This stake can be slashed if the party is found guilty of raising false flags or misbehaving. The stake is also required to post claims or assertions during each step of a challenge. Some protocols may also use another party whose role is only to verify assertions being posted by the proposer. This role does not require a stake to operate.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"extent-of-maliciousness-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#extent-of-maliciousness-5\"></a><strong>Extent of Maliciousness</strong></h1>\n<p>As of now, Optimistic rollups collectively hold over $30 Bn in TVL. All of this value would be at risk if malicious actors win disputes by posting false assertions unless there are robust dispute resolution protocols in place, if not, Optimistic rollups stand to lose hundreds of millions or billions to these actors potentially.</p>\n<p>There are several attack vectors that malicious actors can use to disrupt the chain. These can mainly be classified into delay attacks, economic attacks, and censorship attacks. Current dispute resolution mechanisms that are live, operate on a permissioned and trusted model consisting of entities with high reputations. If any of them were to behave maliciously, they can be punished or kicked off the network. But now, optimistic rollup teams have been coming up with more permissionless dispute resolution methods that would lower the barriers to raising and participating in a dispute. We will look at how Arbitrum’s BOLD, Cartesi’s DAVE, Optimism, and Fuel’s Hybrid Proving mechanism fair against these attack vectors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"delay-attacks-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#delay-attacks-6\"></a>Delay Attacks</h2>\n<p>The idea with delay attacks is to affect the protocol’s liveness. An attacker’s goal is to prevent or delay the confirmation of withdrawals on the L1. A successful delay attack can halt the chain’s progress and cause honest parties to expend resources unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>An attacker may also try to delay a dispute from being resolved by keeping the interactive bisection process going for a much longer duration. If an honest actor cannot respond in time, the challenge could be lost due to a timeout, resulting in the attacker winning the dispute.</p>\n<p>Unlike the currently deployed dispute protocol on Arbitrum, BOLD is designed to resolve disputes within a bounded duration regardless of the number of participants or assertions being made. The currently deployed dispute protocol of Arbitrum has a  “Chess Clock” or a local timer system that allows each responder to have a fixed time period to respond. Once a party makes a move, their timer pauses, and the opposing party’s timer starts ticking. Whichever party’s timer reaches 0 first loses, and the other party ends up winning. This way, causing delays by not responding is not a working strategy for a bad actor.</p>\n<p>With BOLD, there is a concept of “parent” and “child” assertions. The original assertion made by a proposer is the parent, and the resulting assertion is the “child” assertion. Each party has a fixed timer to make their moves, and each assertion inherits the timer from its parent assertion. For example, if the first assertion made had a challenge period of 7 days, and it was challenged on the 2nd day, the time remaining is 5 days. So, the child assertion would now have a timer of 5 days.</p>\n<p>Optimism also uses a local timer mechanism. Additionally, if any bad actor tries to delay the dispute resolution by posting “freeloader” claims, which are claims that do not contribute to the resolution, that actor will be slashed. Similar to the concept of inheritance of timers from parent to child assertions, with Optimism, if a “grand-child” assertion has less than X amount of time remaining, the “grand-child” assertion’s timer is extended to have exactly X amount of time. While this is designed to ensure that the assertion has enough time to be resolved or challenged, it may allow adversaries to cause more delay.</p>\n<p>Cartesi uses a tournament-style refereed mechanism to manage disputes. It splits the dispute into smaller stages and uses binary search to narrow down the exact point of dispute. Each step must be resolved within a predefined time frame. This mechanism is similar to that of BOLD and Optimism, but each round has a separate timer and timing rules. Not meeting the timer limits in each round leads to eliminations. But with a separate timer for each round, a bad actor can choose not to respond and delay the full duration of each of the rounds. Even though the bad actor would get slashed, this would lead to significant delays.</p>\n<p>With Fuel, given that there are no local timer based bisection games in which parties take turns to respond. When there is a dispute, the whole block in question is run through several ZK provers and the resulting ZK proof is submitted as a fraud-proof. Effectively being more resilient to any delay attacks that a malicious attacker could use at this stage. There are possibilities of an attacker controlling some of the ZK provers and verifiers in order to delay the proof generation process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"economics-of-dispute-resolution-protocols-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#economics-of-dispute-resolution-protocols-7\"></a><strong>Economics of Dispute Resolution Protocols</strong></h2>\n<p>Participating in dispute resolution protocols requires different types of economic resources, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bond to be eligible to post assertions and participate in dispute games</li>\n<li>gas costs associated with posting the assertions or moves to the L1</li>\n<li>computation resources that are used as a part of participating in a dispute.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal of an economic attack for an attacker would be to have the honest party expend significantly higher resources than what it would cost the attacker to perform the attack.</p>\n<p>Even a delay attack can be a type of economic attack given that participating in extended disputes requires more resources. So, the attacker may try to exhaust honest parties’ resources so they can no longer afford to participate.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the attacker may try to order transactions being posted to the L1 by placing their own transactions ahead of the honest actor’s transactions. This is possible by either bribing validators or running their own.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"cost-of-participation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#cost-of-participation-8\"></a>Cost of Participation</h3>\n<p>Dispute resolution protocols require a bond to be placed in order to function as a proposer/validator to post assertions or challenge assertions. It also helps deter delays by preventing just anyone from participating in the validation process.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum requires a bond of 3600 ETH to post assertions and can be withdrawn after an assertion has been confirmed. This amount is roughly $13.4 Mn based on current prices. Though this is a high sum, it can also be trustlessly pooled. A challenge bond is required when it comes to opening challenges against assertions posted to Ethereum.

BoLD’s bond requirements are set based on resource exhaustion ratios. The ratio calculates the cost ratio between an honest and malicious party, e.g., a ratio of 5 means defending a $5 attack costs $1. A higher ratio increases security but also bond sizes. BoLD’s ratio has been set to optimize for the tradeoffs between the cost of participation and the security of the chain during challenges. A resource exhaustion ratio &gt;1 means that the defender is always economically advantaged.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/441d8e12caa683512f0c79adf6fac7ab5edb106c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9IzMVNNxJsKX8Wslv97bSc3G3ZW.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/441d8e12caa683512f0c79adf6fac7ab5edb106c_2_690x377.jpeg\" alt=\"4\" data-base62-sha1=\"9IzMVNNxJsKX8Wslv97bSc3G3ZW\" width=\"690\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/441d8e12caa683512f0c79adf6fac7ab5edb106c_2_690x377.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/441d8e12caa683512f0c79adf6fac7ab5edb106c_2_1035x565.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/441d8e12caa683512f0c79adf6fac7ab5edb106c_2_1380x754.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F9F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Having a higher bond requirement will also prevent a bad actor from performing resource exhaustion attacks by making it financially unviable to set up several bonds, causing multiple disputes. Additionally, challenging an assertion is trustless, given that challenge bonds can be set up permisionlessly.</p>\n<p>Optimism’s FDGs’s bond requirements are also similar as the size of the bond depends on the depth of the move or the level of the dispute. There is a base fee assumption of 200 Gwei per gas, and the first depth of the game has a baseline cost of 400,000 gas. Games have a maximum depth of 73. A scaling factor of 1.09493 is used to calculate the required bond at each level of depth. At the max level of depth, the required bond would be about 300,000,000 gas, which amounts to about 60 ETH. Bond requirements at this level are designed to cover double the cost of a max Preimage Proposal. Preimage Proposals are used to submit and verify large data inputs required to verify claims. There is no explicit mention of a bond required to be a part of the network and post assertions in the docs. Given that it is not costly to open challenges, it can lead to an attacker opening multiple challenges and delaying the protocol. Having an initial bond requirement to start posting assertions would deter an attacker from performing such attacks.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/00cb9ceb049514d93406c4d88525e41c5c310ea8.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/72eNMwUK2RKJSxvvGkO1pbcVXa.png?dl=1\" title=\"5\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/00cb9ceb049514d93406c4d88525e41c5c310ea8_2_690x385.png\" alt=\"5\" data-base62-sha1=\"72eNMwUK2RKJSxvvGkO1pbcVXa\" width=\"690\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/00cb9ceb049514d93406c4d88525e41c5c310ea8_2_690x385.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/00cb9ceb049514d93406c4d88525e41c5c310ea8_2_1035x577.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/00cb9ceb049514d93406c4d88525e41c5c310ea8.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8FB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Fuel’s fast finality mechanism talks about requiring a dynamic stake that would influence how long a validator could delay withdrawals in the event of a challenge. If an honest validator with high bonding fails to check-in, it could delay the protocol by 7 days. On the other hand, a validator with a lower bond could delay the withdrawals by 3 days. Withdrawal delays give enough time for the protocol and the remaining honest parties to respond to attacks. In case multiple honest minorities do not respond or go offline, all of their stakes can be weighted together to extend the window longer. Fuel currently has not published the exact bond size numbers.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"incentives-to-defend-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentives-to-defend-9\"></a><strong>Incentives to Defend</strong></h3>\n<p>Given that honest participants in a dispute use these resources to contest against malicious actors, they stand to win a portion of the slashed stake from the malicious actor.</p>\n<p>BOLD tries to ensure that it is economically unviable for an attacker to increase an honest party’s cost of participation. Dishonest parties stand to be slashed and they lose all of their bond. On the other hand, honest parties will be compensated for all their costs and be rewarded with 1% of the slashed funds. As for when there are no challenges, active honest parties will be paid a service fee by the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p>BOLD uses a bisection game where parties are required to commit to the entire execution history using a Merkle tree. In this approach, each step’s assertion and its previous step’s assertions are committed to the Merkle tree. This ensures that if one honest party has used their stake to calculate and commit to an assertion, other honest parties do not need to use their resources to repeat the same step again. This allows honest parties to collaborate trustlessly against bad actors without having to know each other. For example, if Alice and Bob do not know each other but they are both honest, Bob can help Alice defend the right assertion against a bad actor without needing to know each other.</p>\n<p>The currently deployed dispute protocol for Arbitrum allows challenges to happen sequentially. This allows bad actors to start multiple disputes and delay withdrawals.  BoLD enables an honest party to fend off multiple challenges simultaneously &amp; even in such a case, the attacker would be at a disadvantage since the costs for an attacker would always exceed the cost for a defender at the end of the challenge. BOLD can be resistant to such attacks with fixed challenge periods with a local timer and stake being required to make moves.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8fbd28ee3f53f164faa745b3d6b0d7a03bf5b08f.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kvzybOf2I5jwcgsJCtvPKmpCV8r.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fbd28ee3f53f164faa745b3d6b0d7a03bf5b08f_2_514x499.jpeg\" alt=\"6\" data-base62-sha1=\"kvzybOf2I5jwcgsJCtvPKmpCV8r\" width=\"514\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fbd28ee3f53f164faa745b3d6b0d7a03bf5b08f_2_514x499.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fbd28ee3f53f164faa745b3d6b0d7a03bf5b08f_2_771x748.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8fbd28ee3f53f164faa745b3d6b0d7a03bf5b08f.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"CDC6DB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Cartesi’s DAVE also uses the same approach of multi-level refinement and committing to execution histories. This way, honest parties can collaborate trustlessly against bad actors and avoid incurring additional costs. Additionally, with DAVE, the cost of participation for an honest party grows logarithmically with the number of bad actors. This helps honest parties defend against an increasing number of bad actors while their cost of participation does not rise exponentially. But this would lead to delays with an increase in bad actors.</p>\n<p>Given that Fuel uses a check-in-based model, validators have to check in periodically to attest to the validity of state transitions. Depending on the frequency of the check-ins, validators could incur higher or lower costs. To lower these costs, Fuel plans on using ZK aggregator or batching all check-ins over a period of time. Validators here are incentivized by random stake-weighted rewards to check-in.</p>\n<p>With Optimism, the bond/stake required depends on the level or position of the move that a party is about to make in a dispute. Honest responses/moves are incentivized in Optimism’s FDG (<a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/stage-one/fault-dispute-game.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Fault Dispute Game</a>) such that honest moves that successfully counter invalid moves will be <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/stage-one/bond-incentives.html#leftmost-claim-incentives\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">rewarded with the bond of the invalid moves</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"self-disputes-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#self-disputes-10\"></a><strong>Self-Disputes</strong></h3>\n<p>This is where “self disputes” become a problem. Here, a single malicious actor could cause delays by putting up both an honest and a dishonest move. Having an invalid move slashed only for it to be rewarded to the honest move. Effectively making it a zero-cost delay. Additionally, there is a delay before the slashed bonds are rewarded. This is so that the protocol can verify that the dispute game played out correctly and the slashed funds are being rewarded to the right party.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d7afcc212fe968e1f62ef06cefb68f8a5cea31d6.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uM3iClGJHYovNgnHJRF9X93zn14.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d7afcc212fe968e1f62ef06cefb68f8a5cea31d6_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"7\" data-base62-sha1=\"uM3iClGJHYovNgnHJRF9X93zn14\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d7afcc212fe968e1f62ef06cefb68f8a5cea31d6_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d7afcc212fe968e1f62ef06cefb68f8a5cea31d6_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d7afcc212fe968e1f62ef06cefb68f8a5cea31d6.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"72505F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>To model against self disputes, In Arbitrum, all bonds are held in an escrow contract by the dispute protocol. If an assertion is confirmed, the bonds are returned automatically. If the assertion is rejected, bonds are confiscated and sent to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. 1% of the confiscated bonds are rewarded to honest actors who defend against bad actors.  The remainder of the confiscated could be used to reimburse the cost of participation for honest parties. This way, it is not economically feasible for a bad actor to self-dispute to cause delays as they would only be rewarded with 1% of the slashed bonds and may never get their hands on the rest of the 99%.</p>\n<p>Optimism’s FDG docs do not mention if 100% of the slashed bonds are rewarded to the other party or if it is a specific portion. A “DelayedWETH” contract holds bonds for each game. This contract has an “owner” address parameter that can act as the last defense in case bonds from a game are incorrectly distributed. It is unclear how the protocol will notice two or more colluding addresses that may self-dispute to attribute whether funds were incorrectly distributed.</p>\n<p>Fuel’s <a href=\"https://forum.fuel.network/t/why-wait-a-week-fast-finality-optimistic-rollups/4471\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">post</a> did not explicitly mention how they manage self-disputes.

The attacker bears the cost of censoring transactions, which grows based on the severity and duration of censorship. For example, it will cost the attacker more to gain control of 2/3 of Ethereum validators for 1 week than to gain control of 1/3 of validators for 3 days.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3be85624411de52016c45b4fd26fd021eaed97db.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8xXWRsIq5bF26Bx7XPKiyhHxFpx.png?dl=1\" title=\"8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3be85624411de52016c45b4fd26fd021eaed97db_2_690x385.png\" alt=\"8\" data-base62-sha1=\"8xXWRsIq5bF26Bx7XPKiyhHxFpx\" width=\"690\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3be85624411de52016c45b4fd26fd021eaed97db_2_690x385.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3be85624411de52016c45b4fd26fd021eaed97db_2_1035x577.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3be85624411de52016c45b4fd26fd021eaed97db_2_1380x770.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1C2630\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Alternatively, an attacker can fill up Ethereum blocks with frivolous transactions and bribe block builders to include those transactions, effectively pushing out honest parties’ transactions from being included in the current block to the subsequent blocks. This, too, can be considered as a form of a delay attack.</p>\n<p>To kick a bad actor off the network, a transaction must be submitted to Ethereum. Now, if Ethereum is being censored, it will be difficult to carry out this operation. Full censorship is possible if we assume that it could use billions to carry out the attack. But if Ethereum is only being partially censored, the transaction would be validated by the remaining honest validators on Ethereum. As for the set of L2 validators, they can be governed by a DAO or a security council. But censorship would still be possible on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>In BOLD’s case, as there is a local timer mechanism that eliminates a party if their timer runs out, an attacker could potentially censor or prevent an honest party from responding until their timer runs out and the attacker wins. To account for such situations, there is an added buffer to the timer in case an honest party is being censored. It is safe to assume that an attacker will not be able to censor indefinitely as it would consume indefinite resources.</p>\n<p>BOLD has two parameters called Nominal Delay and Censorship Budget (Cmax). Nominal Delay accounts for the regular, expected delays that may occur. Cmax is the maximum amount of time an attacker can censor an honest party before Ethereum’s social layer takes action. This is when both the honest parties’ timer is paused. This allows the honest party to respond once the censorship attack stops.</p>\n<p>Optimism does not have a parameter similar to a Censorship Budget, but the FDG protocol accounts for a nominal delay that an actor could face while operating a validator (time required to coordinate a multi-sig). Optimism uses an off-chain monitoring system that will keep track of all root assertions made by validators and make sure they align with the correct state.</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, Fuel’s mechanism operates on a check-in model where validators must periodically check in, signaling either that everything is correct (true) or indicating a problem (false).  Fuel has modeled for a mass censorship situation where honest parties are unable to respond or check-in. Even if they spot an invalid block, they would not be able to check-in as “false”. Missing a check-in is treated as censorship or inactivity, extending the challenge window up to a maximum of 7 days. Once the censorship attack has concluded, honest parties can check-in again to keep the state finalization process going. Validators may fail to check-in either due to honest inactivity or maliciousness, in which case they would get slashed. To account for honest inactivity, validators could placed with an MPC set-up. So even if some nodes go down, they will collectively continue to check-in.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"role-of-security-councils-and-guardians-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#role-of-security-councils-and-guardians-12\"></a><strong>Role of Security Councils and Guardians</strong></h3>\n<p>Security councils play a role in monitoring whether or not the protocol is functioning as intended and also step in when corrections or reversions are required. They especially come in handy when new protocol designs are deployed that sustain millions, if not billions. Dispute resolution protocols rely on security councils or other entities that have the power to govern the protocol in dire situations. The level of involvement from such an entity directly reflects how thorough or decentralized the dispute resolution protocol is.</p>\n<p>With BoLD, the challenge period lasts 6.4 days. While BoLD does not require proactive monitoring, it has an additional 2-day delay for its security council to step in if there are any major bugs in the protocol in extreme situations.  Under normal conditions, BoLD will function without any intervention from the security council.</p>\n<p>Optimism’s FDG uses a Guardian contract coupled with a security council that takes a more <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-protocol-upgrade-7-fault-proofs/8161/37\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proactive approach</a> and has the final say over the protocol and can disable fault proofs in an emergency. This failsafe mechanism would be at risk if Ethereum is being censored.</p>\n<p>The level of involvement of Fuel’s security council in the fast finality mechanism is unclear but they will be able to step in and take charge of the final state transition in case of attacks or bugs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-13\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>All of the proposed dispute resolution protocols are yet to go live on the mainnet.

If the vote is successful, Arbitrum will get closer to being a stage 2 rollup.</p>\n<p>Optimism’s FDG will likely be audited in June-July, and Optimism’s <a href=\"https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/72085170435228531173144599119267762084652443676555508407874836206178427511368\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fault-proof proposal</a> was voted on successfully. There is no official date as to when this would go live, but protocol upgrade <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#7</span> mentioned it would be shortly after the proposal had been voted on successfully.</p>\n<p>Cartesi’s DAVE is under development, as depicted <a href=\"https://cartesi.io/technical-evolution-plan/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.  Fuel’s hybrid proving and fast finality mechanism are also under development.</p>\n<p>Each dispute mechanism is modeled based on the respective Optimistic rollup’s fraud-proving design. As Arbitrum, Optimism, and Cartesi use interactive verification games, their protocols are more prone to delay and economic attacks, and hence, their dispute mechanism protocols are modeled to handle them better. On the other hand, Fuel’s mechanism is less vulnerable to delay attacks given that there are no interactive verification games but is more prone to censorship attacks as it is reliant on a set of provers and verifiers computing a ZK proof. All the different fraud-proving systems and dispute-resolution protocols can still be vulnerable to a number of attack vectors and internal bugs. Teams are actively working on research and development of these protocols.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1c849cb42a9b8e3d46c2e8f498615b125c9ab536.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/44hul0Z0CSG16Up6q63qYetZLT0.png?dl=1\" title=\"9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1c849cb42a9b8e3d46c2e8f498615b125c9ab536_2_690x386.png\" alt=\"9\" data-base62-sha1=\"44hul0Z0CSG16Up6q63qYetZLT0\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1c849cb42a9b8e3d46c2e8f498615b125c9ab536_2_690x386.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1c849cb42a9b8e3d46c2e8f498615b125c9ab536_2_1035x579.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1c849cb42a9b8e3d46c2e8f498615b125c9ab536.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"3D3E3F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>We’ve seen a handful of L2s and L3s emerge based on Optimistic rollup frameworks. XAI and Syndr, Degen on Arbitrum; Zora and Farcaster on Optimism. With Arbitrum L3s, assertions about L3 state can either be posted by an L3 sequencer or an L2 sequencer through a delayed inbox queue. If the L3 sequencer is censored or offline, assertions can be posted to the L2 sequencer, but if the L2 sequencer is also censored or offline, there is a “forceinclusion” mechanism in place that bypasses the sequencer after 24 hours. This is the happy path without any disputes. If there are disputes, the challenge resolution could take well beyond 7 days, depending upon the number of moves in the dispute. In this case, Arbitrum has a “DelayBuffer” mechanism that allows parties to make moves without being limited by the 24-hrs per move limit by reducing the “forceinclusion” window below 24hrs.</p>\n<p>Shared sequencers will also require faster withdrawal periods to be atomically interoperable. Current fraud-proving delays introduce other possible attack vectors, such as delay attacks, economic attacks, and censorship attacks, that can hinder and extend dispute resolution periods that may not be optimal for shared sequencers.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02880\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Incentive Schemes for Rollup Validators</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10491\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BoLD: Fast and Cheap Dispute Resolution</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-fault-proofs/8161\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism Upgrade Proposal: Fault Proofs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.fuel.network/t/why-wait-a-week-fast-finality-optimistic-rollups/4471\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Why wait a week?

Our report aligns with the goals and overarching objectives of both programs, which aim at understanding the mechanics of effective incentivization within Arbitrum, and the wider web3 ecosystem while supporting network growth. These are our preliminary research findings, which can be greatly expanded upon should we continue the work with the LTIP program.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>As the race for L2 dominance picks up steam, newcomers and incumbents are deploying considerable amounts of capital and resources in an attempt to grow their network size, attract builders, and expand their user base. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand how the design of these incentives influences its outcome and how the DAO can better equip itself to maximize the growth and effectiveness of these mechanisms.</p>\n<p>This report attempts to lay the foundations of a comprehensive analysis that offers actionable insights and highlights notable trends and patterns that inform how subsequent initiatives may be designed, iterated, and improved upon.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>STIP was designed to support network growth by accelerating the distribution of incentives through Arbitrum dApps. This approach allowed for a wide array of incentivization designs, serving as experimental grounds for the development of novel, and better, incentive distribution designs. Our analysis leverages onchain and offchain data sources, including the Arbitrum Governance Forum and Snapshot space, to assess STIP’s impact on network top-line metrics performance, user engagement, acquisition costs, retention, and governance participation and effort.</p>\n<p>Building off the feedback of STIP, LTIPP was designed to continue accelerating network growth. Therefore, we also compared it against its predecessor in terms of feedback distribution, surfacing the most common themes, and quantifying the effort invested by the community during the initial phase of both programs.</p>\n<p>With this report, we aim to empower the Arbitrum Community and the broader ecosystem with actionable insights to boost the impact of incentive initiatives. By better understanding how incentives work and perform, we hope to foster sustained growth for Arbitrum while guiding DAO Operators and Delegates toward more effective strategies that align with the community’s interests and objectives.</p>\n<p>StableLab, as a direct participant in Arbitrum Governance and an advocate for better governance, is aligned with these goals and remains committed to providing accurate, unbiased, and comprehensive analysis to ensure solutions that maximize the DAO’s overall success.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-takeaways-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-takeaways-4\"></a>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>STIP was cost-effective in driving relative growth of top-line network metrics compared to other large initiatives, such as the ARB airdrop.</li>\n<li>User Retention remains a significant challenge with activity levels returning to pre-STIP figures, indicating the necessity of further refinement and innovation in how incentives are designed.</li>\n<li>STIP primarily attracted users that can be labeled as “Traders” (94% of the incentivized users), suggesting the need to adjust the program design in order to further attract and engage with other user segment types.</li>\n<li>During the application phase of STIP, community engagement was extremely skewed toward Yield Aggregators (18 applicants) and DEXs (17 applicants). However, community effort was concentrated in a handful of applicants, belonging to the DEXs (930 hours) and Perpetuals (590 hours) sectors, most likely due to the perceived relevance and renown of some applicants.</li>\n<li>The application phase changes introduced in LTIPP (creation of the advisor role and implementation of a council system) improved the quality and consistency of the feedback received by the applicants while reducing community effort. To be determined if this translates to more impactful incentive designs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"limitations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#limitations-5\"></a>Limitations</h2>\n<p>While we attempted to use as much data available, due to the wide variety of incentive designs deployed, we could not analyze all of these in detail. This remains as something that could be expanded in the future with further research. While the technical data can be obtained, an analysis on how grantees distributed the received funds would need to be made on a case-to-case basis.</p>\n<p>On another note, reading and writing estimates used in the analysis will improve as we acquire additional data from more participants, leading to more accurate effort calculations. Finally, another limiting factor is the time elapsed since the STIP and LTIPP execution and distribution of incentives. As user/engagement metrics rely on user behavior over time, the current data set needs more information to produce definitive conclusions. As with reading and writing estimates, accuracy will improve as more user behavior data is collected and incorporated into the analysis.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"stip-analysis-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stip-analysis-6\"></a>STIP Analysis</h1>\n<p>We used a multi-pronged approach to gain a holistic overview of STIP’s effectiveness. Firstly, we gauged its impact on top-line network metrics through a Causal Impact Analysis. However, we do note that, given the dynamic nature of the space, there is likely unaccounted variance.</p>\n<p>Next, we set out to identify the type of users attracted by the program while attempting to put a price on each user engaged. In addition to tracking user acquisition, we also sought to track their permanence in the network to evaluate the program’s ability to retain users. While the nature of pseudo-anonymity on blockchains makes this a challenging feat, we attempted to track users’ transactions and identify changes before and after STIP. With this data, we produced basic user statistics akin to active users and churn rates.</p>\n<p>Finally, we analyzed the impact of STIP in terms of how much overhead or effort went into the program execution from a community point of view (opportunity cost), and how it compared to LTIPP, which featured a different application and feedback design. More details on this can be found in the section about the LTIPP vs. STIP comparison.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"causal-impact-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#causal-impact-7\"></a>Causal Impact</h2>\n<p>Using Causal Impact Analysis, it is evident that STIP had a significant relative impact on the following top-line network metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total Transactions: 24% increase</li>\n<li>Unique Users: 29% increase</li>\n<li>Total Value Transacted 47% increase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To put this into perspective, ARB airdrop’s relative impact on the same metrics went as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total Transactions: 42% increase</li>\n<li>Unique Users: 85% increase</li>\n<li>Total Value Transacted: 32% increase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we see that the ARB airdrop seems to have produced larger effects by all metrics, we have to take into consideration the price and effort connected to it. STIP had a cost 50M ARB tokens (±40M USD, at a price at the time of voting of ~0.8 USD), whereas the ARB airdrop totaled 1.275B ARB tokens (±1.72B USD). Of course, the goal of the airdrop was not solely to drive the metrics mentioned above. Nevertheless, we can see that in perspective STIP has been very efficient in using the funds.</p>\n<p>To gauge STIP’s impact, we used the time when 75% of proposals had been approved. This is to factor in the delayed response to the incentive being paid out and to find a pessimistic starting point for the effects of STIP being felt in top-level metrics. To gauge the ARB airdrop, we used the exact moment in time when the airdrop was executed.</p>\n<p>Causal Impact analysis takes the period before the event, referred to as “Pre-period”, and the period after the event referred to as “Post-period”. It then compares the change in a metric to a model predicting the most likely trend in the data, if no event would have occurred. The relative difference between the actual found value and the predicted value indicates the impact of the event.</p>\n<p>In a dynamic environment like the Arbitrum ecosystem, these outcomes serve more as an indicator than as a specific value to be derived. They can help put events in perspective but should not be seen as ground truth about the impact of events, as it is impossible to account for all external circumstances from general market sentiment to social trends influencing users around the globe.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e4cf941da8a2a7de04b2bb95f4c68e124d17589d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wE9B5UUiEvnrOQ9NpVViMQpBSsl.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e4cf941da8a2a7de04b2bb95f4c68e124d17589d_2_624x403.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"wE9B5UUiEvnrOQ9NpVViMQpBSsl\" width=\"624\" height=\"403\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e4cf941da8a2a7de04b2bb95f4c68e124d17589d_2_624x403.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e4cf941da8a2a7de04b2bb95f4c68e124d17589d_2_936x604.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e4cf941da8a2a7de04b2bb95f4c68e124d17589d_2_1248x806.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"162128\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Fig. 1 - Impact Analysis - Total Transactions</em><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/15f10f4c5afdaceb11ddb8c0f4e303895b2164a8.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/386uGTHLdGofk1M8BPmmw9GjREY.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/15f10f4c5afdaceb11ddb8c0f4e303895b2164a8_2_627x405.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"386uGTHLdGofk1M8BPmmw9GjREY\" width=\"627\" height=\"405\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/15f10f4c5afdaceb11ddb8c0f4e303895b2164a8_2_627x405.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/15f10f4c5afdaceb11ddb8c0f4e303895b2164a8_2_940x607.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/15f10f4c5afdaceb11ddb8c0f4e303895b2164a8_2_1254x810.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"162028\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Fig. 2 - Impact Analysis - Total Value Transacted</em><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-655x422uploadp5wbpwybalbmxupsih4strqgovqjpeg-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-655x422uploadp5wbpwybalbmxupsih4strqgovqjpeg-8\"></a><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/afd610cd0eea4d6693f565ae53d6c97fc8ef1c98.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/p5wbPwyBalBMxupSIH4sTrQGoVq.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/afd610cd0eea4d6693f565ae53d6c97fc8ef1c98_2_655x422.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"p5wbPwyBalBMxupSIH4sTrQGoVq\" width=\"655\" height=\"422\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/afd610cd0eea4d6693f565ae53d6c97fc8ef1c98_2_655x422.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/afd610cd0eea4d6693f565ae53d6c97fc8ef1c98_2_982x633.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/afd610cd0eea4d6693f565ae53d6c97fc8ef1c98_2_1310x844.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"172128\"></a></div></h3>\n<p><em>Fig. 3 - Impact Analysis - Unique Users</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"user-acquisition-vs-churn-in-stip-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#user-acquisition-vs-churn-in-stip-9\"></a>User Acquisition vs. Churn in STIP</h2>\n<p>The graph below (Figure 4) illustrates users who participated in STIP, displaying wallet creation events and the inactivity that followed.

To analyze this, we sought to mirror classic user churn analysis. In general, STIP effectively brought an influx of activity and the “creation” of new wallets in the network. However, data suggests that the program may have been ineffective in retaining new users after the incentive distribution had ended.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that these analyses become less accurate as we get closer to the present date.

When analyzing the Users Incentivized (active users with &gt;$20 USD in claimed rewards) we see that they are more likely to be categorized in the “Trader” profile (94%) than the average Arbitrum user (43%). Moreover, many of these “Trader” addresses were created recently (shorter lifetime vs. All Abitrum Trader), with higher average transaction counts and active days (vs. All Arbitrum Trader).</p>\n<p>To obtain these results, we analyzed the behavior of all existing addresses and grouped them based on their interactions into five different profiles. While some addresses had too few transactions to be labeled properly, the majority of them could be analyzed such that we should have a representative sample.

The exact definitions for each category can be found in the Ouroboros post linked before.</p>\n<p>To gauge effort, we used engagement metrics on the messages to estimate how many people have read a post and determine the effort, measured in hours, based on metadata like length and complexity of language. To give a brief explanation, we try to estimate the reading and writing effort of a post as a function of word length and the quality/complexity of the post. This means the effort is in simple terms (the amount of people we estimate reading it) multiplied by (word count * average reading speed) multiplied by (the complexity of the language). Added to that is our estimation of the write effort, roughly expressed as (word count) multiplied by (writing speed) multiplied by (constant dependent on language complexity) plus (overhead factor for writing the post).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Est. Reading Effort ~ Est. Readers(Word Count Est. Avg.Reading Speed)</em></p>\n<p><em>Est.Writing Effort ~ Word Count Writing SpeedLang Complexity+Writing Overhead</em></p>\n<p><em>Est.Total Effort ~ Est. Reading Effort +Est.Writing Effort</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, it is important to note that, in terms of writing, an estimation can differ wildly as a well-thought-out message may take a multitude of time to write from a short comment, and factors such as the Writing Overhead and the Language Complexity might require adjustments.</p>\n<p>To determine the value (high vs. low) of the Effort invested, we utilized LLMs to extract and identify the most common topics. Then, based on these topic clusters, we labeled all forum posts (excluding the original application post), highlighting those that were deemed High Value, meaning they contributed useful critiques of the proposal. The exact definitions for each category can be found in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stip-vs-ltipp-comparison-statistics-27\">Posts/Discord Messages Category Definition</a> section in the appendix.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"comparison-to-ltipp-analysis-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#comparison-to-ltipp-analysis-13\"></a>Comparison to LTIPP Analysis</h2>\n<p>Lastly, our goal was to compare STIP and LTIPP in terms of governance operations. To produce this analysis, we considered the design differences between the two incentive programs.</p>\n<p>Overall our results can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During STIP a handful of proposals received most of the attention while others were largely neglected.</li>\n<li>Introducing the Council System ensured more coherent and equal high-value feedback throughout the applications.\n<ul>\n<li>(Average % High-Value posts STIP: 39.3%, Pilot Discord: 88.5%, p-value: 3.4e-61)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Effort in the Forum for LTIPP was significantly less, most likely due to the overall improved quality of the Proposals submitted.\n<ul>\n<li>(Average effort difference, p-value: 0.0024)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LTIPP aims to improve the process of STIP by introducing a council system to better prepare and improve proposals before they move to public discussion. This was achieved via feedback on a Discord <a href=\"https://discord.gg/nUe7QpYCB2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">server</a>. We analyzed messages from the Discourse forum (STIP and LTIPP) and relevant Discord channels within the LTIPP dedicated server to gain better insights on the changes introduced to the process.</p>\n<p>Then we utilized the previously mentioned effort calculation and high-low value categorization to understand the nuances of the feedback discussions taking place during the application process. After accounting for some differences in the data from both programs, we put into perspective the feedback processes of STIP and LTIPP, and how the new format may have influenced it.</p>\n<p>Although any comparison in such complex systems should be viewed carefully, to get usable insights we performed statistical t-tests to infer if a difference is statistically significant. For detailed insights into the differences and magnitudes, see the graphs and tables containing the t-test data in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stip-vs-ltipp-comparison-statistics-27\">STIP vs LTIPP Comparison Statistics</a> section in the Appendix.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-14\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Our analysis of STIP and LTIPP highlights the impact these programs had on the Arbitrum ecosystem. STIP successfully increased top-line network activity metrics. Although these impacts were lower compared to other initiatives, STIP proved to be cost-effective. However, retaining users remains a challenge, with activity levels returning to pre-STIP figures. STIP primarily attracted ‘Traders’, with acquisition costs at approximately 29 ARB per user.</p>\n<p>Applicant distribution was heavily skewed towards Yield Aggregators and DEXs, and community effort was concentrated in only a handful of applicants. LTIPP’s advisor role and the council system introduced improvements, resulting in higher-quality feedback and reduced community effort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"recommendations-and-final-thoughts-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recommendations-and-final-thoughts-15\"></a>Recommendations and Final Thoughts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Retention Strategies: Future initiatives should pay special attention to incorporating mechanisms that sustain user engagement beyond initial incentives.</li>\n<li>Experiment with Different Audiences: By continuing to experiment with incentive designs that focus on other user segments, opportunities to optimize acquisition costs should become evident.</li>\n<li>Continuous Improvement: Use empirical data for iterative improvements and adopt successful elements from LTIPP’s advisor role and the council system into future program designs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>StableLab is dedicated to continuing to provide accurate analyses to support the Arbitrum community.

It may also express concern over the timeline of the proposed grant distribution, over whether the address is a 2/3 multisig, or whether the community support on the forums is authentic or generated by bots.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Size:</strong> The post expresses concern that the amount of ARB tokens that the applicant asked for is too large, especially if the applicant is a non-native protocol. Often the grant size is considered too high relative to the applicant protocol’s TVL, volume, and the perceived value of the applicant’s contributions to the ARB Ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Effectiveness:</strong> The post expresses concern that the proposed incentive mechanisms will not effectively attract and retain the targeted users; however, this does NOT include existing or previous incentive programs that the applicant already has. Furthermore, the users will likely dump the received ARB tokens instead of continuing to participate in the applicant’s protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Applicant Quality:</strong> The post expresses concern about the applicant protocol’s quality. Quality refers to the capital efficiency of the applicant’s product, whether the applicant’s user engagement, trading activity, or TVL is genuine or due to previous or ongoing incentives, the competency of the applicant team, the applicant’s track record on Arbitrum (and other Networks), the maturity of the applicant’s product, the uniqueness or innovation of the applicant’s product, whether applicant’s product has launched or is operational, the applicant product’s TVL, volume, or demand may be too low, or the applicant engaged in wash-trading.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefit to Arbitrum:</strong> The post expresses concern that the grant will be used to mostly benefit the applicant’s protocol, instead of bringing new users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, or expanding the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"support-categories-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#support-categories-20\"></a>Support Categories</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Applicant Quality:</strong> The post expresses praise about the applicant protocol’s quality, which includes but is not limited to mentions of the protocol’s efficiency, the team’s capability, track record in the Arbitrum ecosystem (and other Networks), transparency and honesty.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefit to Arbitrum:</strong> The post expresses confirmation that the application will benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem at large, not just the applicant’s own protocol. Benefits could include, but are not limited to, mentions of flywheel and attracting other protocols to build on Arbitrum or on the applicant’s protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Effectiveness:</strong> The post expresses praise that the proposed incentive mechanisms will effectively attract and retain the targeted users.

It covers operational research and the deployment of a transparency dashboard to improve incentive data accessibility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/953780107\">ArbGrants Dashboard Concept</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is <em>Powerhouse</em>?</strong><br>\n<em>Powerhouse</em> began as MakerDAO Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES) Core Unit in the MakerDAO supporting the incubator program and building the operational infrastructure of one of the largest DAO experiments to date. As SES, <em>Powerhouse</em> team members helped teams to organize operations and connect them with relevant service providers. We learned a lot during the two years of operating this incubator and are now working at translating our best practices into open-source software for DAOs.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Powerhouse</em> Builds Open-source Operations Platforms</strong><br>\nWe translate business workflows, processes, and information systems into software to power large on-chain organizations. <em>Powerhouse</em> retains a full stack operations staff and technical staff, including Business Development, Business Analysts, Marketing, and a Full Stack Software Development team. <em>Powerhouse</em> focuses on modular open source systems as public goods. This modular approach reduces implementation time and accelerates the growth of DAOs. The objective of <em>Powerhouse</em> is to help DAOs scale by overcoming coordination failure.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Powerhouse</em> Uses Embedded Project Teams</strong><br>\n<em>Powerhouse</em> retains a complete project team to fulfill the proposed Research Bounty scope. The team will manage and implement the SOW described below: the workflow analysis in Milestone 1 and the delivery of a transparency dashboard in Milestone 2.<br>\nThe workflow analysis will review and map the current LTIPP workflows with recommendations for improvement. Independent of this analysis, the grant also delivers a transparency dashboard to permit easy access to LTIPP incentive data.</p>\n<p><strong>LTIPP and STIP are Complex</strong></p>\n<p>STIP and LTIPP are ambitious initiatives designed to rapidly increase the adoption of Arbitrum through liquidity incentives. The LTIPP strategy involves a broad distribution of ARB tokens within a short period. Due to the large scale and complexity of this distribution, stringent operational practices are necessary to ensure the program’s success.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Powerhouse</em> Software as the Solution</strong></p>\n<p><em>Powerhouse</em> provides several software products that together form the <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/products\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><em>Powerhouse</em> Platform</a>. Teams begin by using software to structure and implement their operational workflows (<em><strong>Powerhouse Connect</strong></em>). These workflows capture data which provides the information to an analytics backend enabling data availability (<em><strong>Powerhouse Switchboard</strong></em>) which is presented and interacted with publicly via a dashboard (<em><strong>Powerhouse Fusion</strong></em>). Access and roles in workflows are managed using Ethereum addresses on Arbitrum to provide identity and authentication (<em><strong><em>Powerhouse</em> Renown)</strong></em>. All <em>Powerhouse</em> Software modules are open-source to build on and extend the public commons. For more information regarding each product, please see a recent keynote <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5GnRqdoXt8o?si=TkjzKJvjTqPAoNUe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>, with <em>Powerhouse</em> Product Lead, callmeT.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1e77bcabb89475c53785b8217e85ccd26547773d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/4lwRhHfLivrPofFnpOQ9s8NiHeJ.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1e77bcabb89475c53785b8217e85ccd26547773d_2_624x349.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"4lwRhHfLivrPofFnpOQ9s8NiHeJ\" width=\"624\" height=\"349\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1e77bcabb89475c53785b8217e85ccd26547773d_2_624x349.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1e77bcabb89475c53785b8217e85ccd26547773d_2_936x523.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1e77bcabb89475c53785b8217e85ccd26547773d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"2A3339\"></a></div><br>\n<strong>Figure 1.</strong> An Overview of the Four <em>Powerhouse</em> Products<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://arbgrants.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbGrants.com</a>: <strong>Live Operational Software for Arbitrum LTIPP</strong></p>\n<p><em>Powerhouse</em> partnered with <em>Stablelab</em> to prepare a software proof of concept. First, we performed a requirements analysis and examined the current critical path blockers for Arbitrum LTIPP and STIP Program Management. We identified the largest pain point was organizing ongoing incentive reporting. <em>Powerhouse</em> then designed an ideal workflow and reviewed the proposed user experience with the Grants Council and Program Manager. The workflow was intended to replace the current incentive reporting workflow on the Arbirtum Discourse Forums.</p>\n<p><em>Powerhouse</em> then developed and implemented this reporting workflow as an open source software module. The module is currently hosted at <a href=\"https://www.arbgrants.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.arbgrants.com</a> and supports the reporting and organization of bi-weekly incentive information. This workflow makes accessible information for use by the LTIPP Program Manager, the Grants Council, Incented Projects, and the community at large.</p>\n<p>The software captures information that was previously hard to consolidate. It offers the 100 protocols a reliable and standardized way to report their biweekly metrics. At a later point in time, <em>Powerhouse</em> may prepare a proposal to provide Arbitrum an option for retroactive funding if they desire.</p>\n<p>Today, in this proposal, we present an opportunity to continue the momentum and extend this work through further business analysis and a transparency dashboard to improve presentation and accessibility of this LTIPP incentive data.</p>\n<p><strong>Next Step: Visualizing Incentive Data and Preparation for Full LTIP</strong><br>\nNow that we have a workflow to report data, the next step is to prepare a custom dashboard to make this data accessible. Using <em><strong>Connect</strong></em>, <em><strong>Fusion</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Switchboard</strong></em>, we will prepare a dashboard to report relevant metrics. Attached below are two example screenshots of a grantee directory and dashboard. This first scope of work establishes a dashboard to view LTIPP information reported and will be forward compatible with additional <em><strong>Connect</strong></em> data streams should Arbitrum desire.</p>\n<p>In order to prepare Arbitrum for LTIP, we will proceed in parallel with a deeper workflow and business analysis on the existing STIP and LTIPP program implementations. Through this analysis, we intend to map existing workflows and identify opportunities to leverage software to improve program efficiency and transparency.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/81b4159dc316da3aaffa4bbfc363eeeef43a3acd.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ivpqdjmVNyEMo0xgQEO6lc795Ex.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81b4159dc316da3aaffa4bbfc363eeeef43a3acd_2_530x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ivpqdjmVNyEMo0xgQEO6lc795Ex\" width=\"530\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81b4159dc316da3aaffa4bbfc363eeeef43a3acd_2_530x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81b4159dc316da3aaffa4bbfc363eeeef43a3acd_2_795x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81b4159dc316da3aaffa4bbfc363eeeef43a3acd_2_1060x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F9F9F9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> An example of the LTIPP grantee directory.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/18fbd20ecf943692235d0ac10d2a6b1b71c18c27.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3z0YTZ5dwEhVoTXctHLqLfHJhrN.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18fbd20ecf943692235d0ac10d2a6b1b71c18c27_2_429x499.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"3z0YTZ5dwEhVoTXctHLqLfHJhrN\" width=\"429\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18fbd20ecf943692235d0ac10d2a6b1b71c18c27_2_429x499.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18fbd20ecf943692235d0ac10d2a6b1b71c18c27_2_643x748.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18fbd20ecf943692235d0ac10d2a6b1b71c18c27_2_858x998.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF3F7\"></a></div><br>\n<strong>Figure 3.</strong> An example of the LTIPP Overview Dashboard.<p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"statement-of-work-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#statement-of-work-2\"></a><strong>Statement of Work</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Term</strong></p>\n<p>The statement of work is anticipated to span approximately 12 weeks from June 10 to September 10. Both Milestones will run concurrently and conclude no later than 12 weeks from initiation. <em>Powerhouse</em> will meet weekly with the LTIPP Program Manager, who will act as the Arbitrum interlocutor, to provide status updates and report progress.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Milestone 1.</strong> STIP/LTIPP Workflow Business Analysis and Report</strong></p>\n<p>Milestone 1 prepares a workflow analysis to map and describe the current LTIPP process, identifying areas for improvement. The scope of the report will include an analysis of the following phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RFP preparation and presentation;</li>\n<li>Proposal Creation, Submission, and Review;</li>\n<li>Project (Grantee) onboarding; incentive reporting;</li>\n<li>and Performance Reporting and Evaluation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The focus will be to identify opportunities to improve existing processes, with the express goal of later translating these processes into scalable open-source software modules. The process will include planning and qualitative interviews with key stakeholders (e.g. Program Manager, Grants Council Members, and Grantees). This workflow analysis and research will help Arbitrum establish a calibrated operational budget for the full scale LTIP to support both the requisite operations as well as the necessary software to facilitate scaling and transparency.</p>\n<p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p>\n<p><em>1.1</em> Project Roadmap and Gannt. <em>Powerhouse</em> scopes the high level research phases in collaboration with key stakeholders and prepares a project roadmap.</p>\n<p><em>1.2</em> Qualitative Stakeholder Interviews. <em>Powerhouse</em> will identify key stakeholders and perform qualitative interviews in order to identify outstanding issues and potential remedies.</p>\n<p><em>1.3</em> Final Report. <em>Powerhouse</em> delivers a final report which includes a visual mapping of existing workflows and stakeholder actions, a review of identified issues, and proposed technical solutions and improvements where available.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2. LTIPP Transparency Dashboard</strong></p>\n<p>Milestone 2 supports LTIPP transparency through an informational dashboard. The project involves connecting the information provided from the grant reporting workflow into a software product for use by key stakeholders and the community. The dashboard will display all data captured by ARBgrants, including the biweekly ARB distributed, each incentivized contract, and the total ARB distributed. It will feature graphs plotting ARB distribution against each two week incentive term. The dashboard will dynamically update as incented projects submit new data allowing for near real-time display.</p>\n<p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p>\n<p><em>2.1</em> Project Roadmap and Gannt. <em>Powerhouse</em> scopes the high level grant phases in collaboration with key stakeholders and delivers a project roadmap.</p>\n<p><em>2.2</em> Qualitative Stakeholder Interviews. <em>Powerhouse</em> performs qualitative interviews in order to identify requirements and stakeholder preferences for dashboard metrics and UX.</p>\n<p><em>2.3</em> Dashboard Development. <em>Powerhouse</em> develops the required dashboard frontend to connect to the existing backend for <a href=\"http://arbgrants.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">arbgrants.com</a> and the Switchboard API. Implementation will be similar to the mocks and video provided.</p>\n<p><em>2.4</em> Dashboard Live Operations. <em>Powerhouse</em> delivers and hosts a live dashboard for use by Key Stakeholders and the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Terms</strong></p>\n<p>Grant terms and conditions are delineated in the RFP <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/streamlining-the-ltipp-bounties\">here</a>. The transparency dashboard software project will be available as AGPL. <em>Powerhouse</em> will continue to independently develop the underlying infrastructure and future platform updates will benefit this ArbGrants transparency dashboard and the <em>Connect</em> Product.</p>\n<p>30,000 ARB due Upon Completion of KYC (June 10 Expected)</p>\n<p>30,000 ARB due upon Delivery of Milestone 1 and 2 and all underlying deliverables (Sept 10 Expected)</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/powerhouse-operations-and-transparency-research-proposal/24760\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/powerhouse-operations-and-transparency-research-proposal/24760","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 02:03:53 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24760"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/powerhouse-operations-and-transparency-research-proposal/24760.rss","#text":"Powerhouse: Operations and Transparency Research Proposal"},"filter":false},{"title":"Delegate Incentive Program Results (MAY 2024)","dc:creator":"SEEDGov","category":"Delegate Incentives Program","description":"<p>We are proud to announce the initial outcomes of the third month of the Delegate Incentive Program.

Bridge assets on the Arbitrum deployment are currently only USDC.e and WETH.  This design ring-fences the risk of each pool, allowing a wider range of assets to be onboarded than more common single pool protocols.  Any markets with willing-lenders, such as Curve LP tokens and Pendle PT tokens, can be created.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"base-and-bridge-assets-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#base-and-bridge-assets-5\"></a>Base and Bridge Assets</h3>\n<p>Silo categorizes assets as either bridge or base assets. Bridge assets are defined assets per deployment useable as collateral in any silo, while base assets are any asset other than bridge assets.</p>\n<p>Bridge assets refer to predefined assets that may be used as collateral or deposited into any silo in a deployment.</p>\n<p>Bridge Asset deposits are only exposed to the silo they are deposited into. For example, if $USDC is deposited into the $ARB silo, its exposure is limited to $ARB (the base asset) and $ETH (the secondary bridge asset) only. An exploit in the $PENDLE silo will not affect $USDC deposits in the $ARB silo since they are standalone markets.</p>\n<p>Bridge Asset deposit rates are derived from the IRM configuration for that specific silo. More aggressive models may be applied to riskier silos (e.g., low on-chain liquidity), allowing counterparty lenders to receive more interest to reflect risk exposure.</p>\n<p>Base assets refer to any non-bridge asset that has a lending market on Silo. Base assets can theoretically be any token, including standard and esoteric tokens.</p>\n<p>Base assets can only be used as collateral in their own market. For example, $ARB can only be used as collateral to borrow from bridge lenders in the $ARB silo - it cannot be used in the $PENDLE silo, which only accepts $PENDLE as base asset collateral.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"markets-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#markets-6\"></a>Markets</h3>\n<p>Each market on Silo Arbitrum consists of the base asset, which defines the market, and the two bridge assets, USDC.e and WETH.

This detailed, bottom-up analysis scrutinizes individual components of the STIP, which are unique to Silo. This approach allows for a clear understanding of how the program’s results were achieved and how these insights could be applied to other similar protocols.</p>\n<p>Despite the STIP program’s short-term nature, this report assesses its prolonged benefits by analyzing protocol usage data following the program’s conclusion. The aim is to identify any persistent changes in activity and the factors driving them.</p>\n<p>The primary use case on Silo is to deposit base assets and borrow bridged assets. Therefore, the impact analysis will focus on the effects of the incentives on the growth of the supply of bridged assets available for borrowing (the supply side) and the growth in the borrowing of these bridged assets (the demand side).</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of Silo’s incentives is thoroughly examined across various dimensions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How did the incentives affect the total amount of bridged asset lending?\n<ul>\n<li>Was the impact the same for USDC.e and WETH?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How did the incentives affect the total amount of bridged asset borrowing?\n<ul>\n<li>Was the impact the same for USDC.e and WETH?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How did the incentives affect base asset lenders?</li>\n<li>Did this stimulate additional trading activity on Arbitrum or cannibalize existing activity?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of the incentives is also analyzed to gain insight into the structural efficiency of this program.</p>\n<p>All data is up to 19 May 2024.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"bridged-asset-lender-reactions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#bridged-asset-lender-reactions-15\"></a>Bridged Asset Lender Reactions</h2>\n<p>Lenders on Silo deposit tokens into markets to earn yield or use them as collateral for borrowing.</p>\n<p>Users depositing tokens to earn yield typically provide bridge assets. Occasionally, there is demand to borrow base assets for purposes like shorting, hedging, or yield arbitrage, which generates yield for lenders. GMX, PENDLE, RDNT, LUSD, and weETH were generally the base tokens that generated the most yield.</p>\n<p>Users depositing tokens as collateral usually deposit base tokens and borrow either USDC.e to leverage their exposure to the base token price or borrow WETH to leverage their exposure to the token’s yield.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"impact-on-total-bridged-asset-lending-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#impact-on-total-bridged-asset-lending-16\"></a>Impact on Total Bridged Asset Lending</h3>\n<p>The launch of STIP rewards was transformative for Silo Finance in attractive lending capital.  USDC.e deposits received most of the incentives, but over time, as Pendle PT markets and LRT markets launched, WETH deposits overtook them in total value supplied.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the STIP program, total bridged assets supplied increased 332% from $13m to $56m.  The total dollar amount of this growth was relatively evenly split between USDC.e and WETH; however, when measured in percentage terms, the growth of WETH is much higher at 581% vs 229% for USDC.e.</p>\n<p>Since the end of the STIP program, USDC.e deposits have fallen 46% from $30m to $16m.  This highlights how sensitive USDC.e suppliers are to incremental yield.  The conclusion of the STIP program also coincided with a general spike in stablecoin yields across DeFi which could have cannibalized some of Silo’s yield-earning suppliers.</p>\n<p>WETH deposits, however, have continued to grow, increasing a further 36% since the program ended.  The favorable environment of yield and airdrop farming of LRTs via looped lending on Silo directly and through Pendle PT tokens has supported this growth.  The successful bootstrapping of these markets on Silo over the STIP has worked out favorably for Silo and Arbitrum DeFi generally, as leverage seekers have a deep, liquid venue for their strategies.</p>\n<p>Currently USDC.e supplies are up 76% since the start of the STIP program, and WETH supplies up 825%.  This leaves bridged asset supplies up 3x, a similar level to the end of the program.  <strong>This clearly demonstrates a significant, lasting impact from the use of incentives in growing bridged asset lending.</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/p3a3N7Ifdpvg8Tb8qbJ00L5rdaC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Silo Arbitrum Bridged Asset Deposits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e_2_574x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Silo Arbitrum Bridged Asset Deposits\" data-base62-sha1=\"p3a3N7Ifdpvg8Tb8qbJ00L5rdaC\" width=\"574\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e_2_574x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e_2_861x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"272D2E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/n25CiGkzy9PHXikSZh0LaaocNRD.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Share of Bridge Assets Supplied on Silo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1_2_574x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Share of Bridge Assets Supplied on Silo\" data-base62-sha1=\"n25CiGkzy9PHXikSZh0LaaocNRD\" width=\"574\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1_2_574x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1_2_861x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"374E5A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"bridged-asset-borrower-reactions-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#bridged-asset-borrower-reactions-17\"></a>Bridged Asset Borrower Reactions</h2>\n<p>As the supply of bridged assets flowed to Silo at the start of the STIP, it was immediately lent out.

Between January-March 2024, the DAO was spending an average of 13.8M ARB per month, or roughly $15M, with 90%+ of the spend going towards attracting users through protocol incentives programs. The risks associated with the DAO’s current treasury structure are widely acknowledged (negative feedback loop where excessive ARB spend leads to price depreciation and therefore treasury devaluation), with many teams currently working on proposals for treasury management strategies.</p>\n<p>However, there has been less conversation and research put into the topic of DAO revenue, which today is primarily driven through sequencer margin. Sequencer margin is the result of the difference between the fee charged to end users and the costs for data availability and settlement on Ethereum. The motivation behind this post can best be explained through two charts: Image 1 (H/t <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/r3gen_finance\">@r3gen_Finance</a>) shows the DAO’s ETH net fee flow between March 2023-March 2024, whereas Image 2 shows the same data set extended through May 2024.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a5107d02ec4e22b284299a11ba5732a72ff63b07.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nye6JQ5xbqiIixTc59V1MtEgaNx.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"r3gen Arb ETH Treasury Flow\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a5107d02ec4e22b284299a11ba5732a72ff63b07_2_690x315.jpeg\" alt=\"r3gen Arb ETH Treasury Flow\" data-base62-sha1=\"nye6JQ5xbqiIixTc59V1MtEgaNx\" width=\"690\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a5107d02ec4e22b284299a11ba5732a72ff63b07_2_690x315.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a5107d02ec4e22b284299a11ba5732a72ff63b07_2_1035x472.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a5107d02ec4e22b284299a11ba5732a72ff63b07.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E1EBF1\"></a></div><br>\n<a href=\"https://dune.com/David_C/arb-one-profits-and-ecosystem-stats\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6501b284fa09f31eeee5f907e868c4ac363c5a9d.jpeg\" alt=\"Arb ETH Treasury Flow Post Atlas\" data-base62-sha1=\"epxRnT0I6DX0sawkSiAYQtvVEuN\" width=\"690\" height=\"335\"></a><p></p>\n<p>As one can easily point out, the amount of ETH flowing into the DAO’s treasury has essentially gone flat since the end of April 2024. The root cause of this was two protocol changes that came with the <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbos-20-atlas-da106378326b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbOS Atlas upgrade</a> on March 18, shortly after the implementation of EIP-4844 on Ethereum. The L1 surplus fee per compressed byte was lowered from 2 gwei to 0 gwei, essentially removing the L1 surplus fee altogether, and the minimum L2 base fee was reduced from 0.10 gwei to 0.01 gwei. While this has been a benefit to users, developers, and protocols, it has come at the expense of the Arbitrum DAO’s primary revenue stream. We believe the reason for the mismatch in timing between the fall off in DAO revenue and the aforementioned upgrades was simply a delay in funds being officially transferred from the fee inbox to the <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xbfc1feca8b09a5c5d3effe7429ebe24b9c09ef58#internaltx\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DAO’s treasury timelock</a>.</p>\n<p>The following chart breaks down Arbitrum’s fee revenue at a more granular level, which shows the significant decrease in daily revenue around the middle of March. The L2 base fee had historically served as the DAO’s main revenue driver, but has been overtaken by L2 surplus fees since the ArbOS Atlas and EIP-4844 upgrades went live.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2914457/4843759?Select+Date+Granularity_e15077=week&amp;Select+Timeframe_e15077=90\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/071036cbaed615ecab806e2ec93df3607804b83c.jpeg\" alt=\"Base / Surplus Breakdown\" data-base62-sha1=\"10u50j6rmADmBWGmw4IWMC1vsD2\" width=\"690\" height=\"295\"></a></p>\n<p>For the 71 days between January 5 (2024) to March 17, the DAO generated ~2,125 ETH of profit. For the 71 days between March 18 and May 27, the DAO generated ~938 ETH of profit, with nearly half of that coming from a two day period in April where L2 Surplus Fees were abnormally high due to congestion fees kicking in. So even though a statistical outlier heavily skews the post-upgrade profit numbers to the upside, the DAO’s ETH revenue was still down greater than 55% with higher day-to-day variance in DAO profit than the pre-upgrade era.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Base and Optimism have begun to regularly surpass Arbitrum in weekly profit generation despite Arbitrum consistently seeing a higher level of onchain activity. It is worth noting that if changes were to be made to Arbitrum’s gas pricing mechanism, it could put downward pressure on overall activity due to the increase in costs. However, another important factor to consider is the hefty amount of ARB incentives available across dozens of applications on Arbitrum, whereas Base (the most profitable Ethereum L2) does not have the luxury of a token. This begs the question – should the DAO charge slightly more for gas while incentives are plentiful in order to recoup some of the spend? Or is this approach missing the forest for the trees by focusing too heavily on short term profits over attracting and retaining users for the long-term in an effort to reach economies of scale?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2914457/4843759?Select+Date+Granularity_e15077=week&amp;Select+Timeframe_e15077=90\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6cd4f3e69d080e9e494cef9b7752d4783bbbbc20.jpeg\" alt=\"Rollup Sector Chain Profit\" data-base62-sha1=\"fwLOAusFesrswXY50FqoI285RG8\" width=\"690\" height=\"332\"></a></p>\n<p>Popular transaction types, such as a Uniswap swap, already <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/1064888/1829300\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">cost</a> 2-5x less on Arbitrum than OP Stack chains on most days.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4e33eeac77ebb3a90488e5648a1cd3cae77c9a77.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/b9OvrAafhYqNnbHenluFbET81ZZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"Uniswap Swap Fee 7D MA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4e33eeac77ebb3a90488e5648a1cd3cae77c9a77_2_690x402.png\" alt=\"Uniswap Swap Fee 7D MA\" data-base62-sha1=\"b9OvrAafhYqNnbHenluFbET81ZZ\" width=\"690\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4e33eeac77ebb3a90488e5648a1cd3cae77c9a77_2_690x402.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4e33eeac77ebb3a90488e5648a1cd3cae77c9a77_2_1035x603.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4e33eeac77ebb3a90488e5648a1cd3cae77c9a77_2_1380x804.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"091121\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The following table taken from the Paradigm team’s recent <a href=\"https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/04/reth-perf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">research</a> on Reth outlines target gas parameters across leading EVMs.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8d819624b5c2a9ea548791ac6fb527d3a0779c2a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kbOXAyMluuK3SqBBuPbdVmShxjQ.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Gas Targets\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d819624b5c2a9ea548791ac6fb527d3a0779c2a_2_690x482.jpeg\" alt=\"Gas Targets\" data-base62-sha1=\"kbOXAyMluuK3SqBBuPbdVmShxjQ\" width=\"690\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d819624b5c2a9ea548791ac6fb527d3a0779c2a_2_690x482.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d819624b5c2a9ea548791ac6fb527d3a0779c2a_2_1035x723.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d819624b5c2a9ea548791ac6fb527d3a0779c2a_2_1380x964.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The target gas per block is in practice where congestion pricing kicks in. The lower the target gas, the more quickly L2 surplus fees begin to scale. Interestingly enough, Base contributors <a href=\"https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1795572376555712551\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">recently</a> increased its target gas per block in order to scale up to 6.25 mg/s, and is aiming to increase it again soon to achieve 7.5 mg/s. So it appears the Base team favors the “lower fees, reach economies of scale” approach mentioned above. OP Stack chains do not apply a hard-coded minimum L2 base fee as Arbitrum does, but instead have a maximum base fee increase or decrease per block (2% and 0.4% respectively as default) that adjusts based upon how far above or below a given block is from the predefined gas target (5M target gas per block by default). Arbitrum leverages something similar to OP Stack chains, as both mechanisms mimic EIP-1559 in many ways, called a “backlog” that monitors gas usage against a “speed limit” in an effort to ensure long-term sustainability by avoiding excessive gas usage. The base fee increases exponentially if the backlog grows, but decreases as the backlog shrinks. <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/inside-arbitrum-nitro#the-speed-limit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Quoting the documentation</a>, “F = exp(-a(B-b)), where a and b are suitably chosen constants: a controls how rapidly the price escalates with backlog, and b allows a small backlog before the base fee escalation begins”.</p>\n<p>Another key difference between OP Stack chains and Arbitrum is that Optimism orders transactions based on priority fees, whereas Arbitrum operates its sequencer using the FIFO model. According to this <a href=\"https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-bedrock-priority-fee-monitoring\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">query</a>, Optimism saw 25% of transactions over the past 30 days use a priority fee greater than 0.10 gwei, which ironically is where the Arbitrum minimum L2 base fee was set prior to Atlas. To provide a more detailed explanation of the impact of priority fees, we can look at the following spike on Base for “fast” priority fees at 15:31 UTC on May 29.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/payton/base-l2-gas-price-tracker\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a7670ee1eefe4fa82b4ff0ee4a1afc239156318d.jpeg\" alt=\"Priority Fees\" data-base62-sha1=\"nSUxonF5y2KWtgHFOO8XifA6nZX\" width=\"690\" height=\"315\"></a><br>\nThis is what blocks typically look like on Base:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://basescan.org/blocks\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e8ffe05f692a5ee913e97fffacca22159f0b35eb.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"xfcZ7SWmwlcvMyWpVJLHwtCR9Kb\" width=\"605\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\"></a></p>\n<p>However, at the time of 15:31 UTC on May 29, blocks were consuming far more gas, and priority fees escalated as a result (for those curious, the cause looks to be related to a gas intensive, ERC-4337 related operation coinciding with a public NFT mint):</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8097adaf27db2f54ae4e8beea20d72de1bd5bd8d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ilA5jQ1UqsDYcLFtJybGhMLnWK9.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8097adaf27db2f54ae4e8beea20d72de1bd5bd8d_2_601x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ilA5jQ1UqsDYcLFtJybGhMLnWK9\" width=\"601\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8097adaf27db2f54ae4e8beea20d72de1bd5bd8d_2_601x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8097adaf27db2f54ae4e8beea20d72de1bd5bd8d_2_901x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8097adaf27db2f54ae4e8beea20d72de1bd5bd8d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F9FB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This priority fee auction appears to be a large driver of OP Stack chains’ sequencer revenue, and could potentially be explored for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>More research needs to be conducted on the exact inner-workings of Arbitrum’s gas pricing mechanism in order to make any concrete recommendations. It appears to Entropy Advisors that there are 3 paths to effectively increasing fees:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increase the L2 minimum base fee from 0.01 gwei to something agreed upon by the DAO. In our opinion, this is the simplest option and is the least likely to have negative effects on various ecosystem participants.</li>\n<li>Decrease the target gas per block, effectively kicking in congestion fees earlier.</li>\n<li>Adjust the “a” in the exponential backlog formula ( F = exp(-a(B-b)) ) to increase the rate of change to the base fee during times of congestion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Adjusting constant “a” has the benefit of letting the market decide the gas price, but it could have significant consequences if implemented irrationally. On the other hand, simply raising the minimum base fee would have more predictable effects, but some folks prefer the free market to price resources. Adjusting the target gas per block would likely have similar advantages and drawbacks as adjusting constant “a” in the aforementioned exponential function of the backlog. Again, significantly more research and backtesting is required before we attempt an executable proposal, but we wanted to get the conversation started considering the disparity in ETH sequencer earnings between Arbitrum and other leading Ethereum L2s.

It’s a small enough change that data could be collected and analyzed with more drastic changes being implemented later. It is also a relatively fast measure to implement barring the DAO voting process, so we could quickly begin accruing more ETH to the DAO treasury in the midst of heightened activity, and thus extending the DAOs runway and helping protect it against ARB price fluctuations.

This is more than we spend on entertainment, connecting with friends and family, or gaming. CollabTech is what we call those tools that we use to work together - efficiently, at scale, and with more freedom.</p>\n<p>The traditional corporate world calls these tools “B2B SaaS”, which is a key business vertical with a market valued at <a href=\"https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/b2b-saas-market/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USD 327.74 Billion (2023)</a>. It is projected to reach USD 1088.15 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 18.7% (using data from B2B SaaS). CollabTech can be thought of as the next generation of B2B SaaS, built on decentralized blockchain technology (or Web3).

It is a very early example, but also a cautionary one. Web3 CollabTech remains largely underdeveloped despite its long history. On top of the challenging volatility of the space, important setbacks have included large-scale hacks (e.g. The DAO), ill-conceived forms of governance that led to the quick rise and downfall of DAOs as a meme, lack of sustainable business models in NFT communities, and an adverse regulatory environment in the USA. These early and frequent setbacks have reduced interest in the category and led to it being frequently misunderstood - placing it in the canonical Trough of Disillusionment. </p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1e7968b7e1bd1da47355d94622b9983072b44ea.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/n6h2Y4pUht62ClBAKtSauBOnH86.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1e7968b7e1bd1da47355d94622b9983072b44ea_2_666x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"n6h2Y4pUht62ClBAKtSauBOnH86\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1e7968b7e1bd1da47355d94622b9983072b44ea_2_666x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1e7968b7e1bd1da47355d94622b9983072b44ea.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1e7968b7e1bd1da47355d94622b9983072b44ea.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F3F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<aside class=\"onebox wikipedia\" data-onebox-src=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">en.wikipedia.org</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    \n\n<h3><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gartner hype cycle</a></h3>\n\n<p>The Gartner hype cycle is a graphical presentation developed, used and branded by the American research, advisory and information technology firm Gartner to represent the maturity, adoption, and social application of specific technologies.

Namely:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s a large market with low competition and high potential for blockchain utilisation</li>\n<li>Web2 CollabTech is ripe for disruption and Web3 can address key failure points</li>\n<li>CollabTech provides new use cases for Orbit chains and other Arbitrum infrastructure</li>\n<li>Collabtech already has traction in Arbitrum and leads generation of sequencer fees</li>\n<li>It enables positive social impact and positive narratives</li>\n<li>And it serves as an ideal stepping stone to innovate in venture building</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"large-market-low-competition-and-high-value-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#large-market-low-competition-and-high-value-3\"></a>Large Market, Low Competition, and High Value</h3>\n<p>CollabTech is a market valued at USD 327.74 Billion (2023), projected to reach USD 1088.15 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 18.7% (using data only from B2B SaaS).</p>\n<p>Currently, the CollabTech vertical lacks a clear leader amongst L2s/L1s. Polygon has set a dedicated initiative to target Web2 customers with Web3 B2B tools, Optimism is attracting some key projects (funding DAO Spring amongst others), and Q blockchain is making some progress, but no one has yet managed to become the go-to place for CollabTech builders.</p>\n<p>Typical applications without the need for intensive resources, like CRM systems, are now budgeting 10% of their revenues just for cloud services. Resource-intensive businesses (e.g. bigdata-as-a-service) tend to allocate up 20% to 40% of their revenues to pay for cloud services. On top of this, there is about 147 zettabytes of data expected to be generated by the end of 2024. Bridging even 10% of this to web3 would create massive growth for L1 and L2s, not only in the number of transactions but also in overall data processed on-chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"a-market-ready-for-disruption-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#a-market-ready-for-disruption-4\"></a>A market ready for disruption</h3>\n<p>The Web2 CollabTech stack is heavily fragmented, with financial assets, governance, accounting, and other systems all living in silos. Blockchains offer a solution to this issue, and can lead to all organisations (whether decentralized or not) eventually moving on-chain.</p>\n<p>Web3 can improve the current tooling because B2B SaaS all get built on key concepts that Web3 is uniquely suited for (Identity and Permissions of people and objects, Attestation and Verification, Agreements and Commitments, Communication and Data Management, etc). There’s a massive opportunity for B2B SaaS tools to evolve and become truly collaborative and unlock new ways of connecting, automating, and working together.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"arbitrum-traction-generation-of-sequencer-fees-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#arbitrum-traction-generation-of-sequencer-fees-5\"></a>Arbitrum Traction &amp; Generation of Sequencer Fees</h3>\n<p>CollabTech is already the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> sequencer fees generator in Arbitrum thanks to <a href=\"https://x.com/Flynnjamm/status/1750526681289568402\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Quest Protocol </a>(RabbitHole), and with the right strategy, the success of Quest Protocol could be emulated by a host of projects and position Arbitrum as the leading ecosystem for innovators in this soon to be $1,000bn+ market.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"orbit-chains-unlock-privacy-and-new-use-cases-for-arbitrum-infra-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#orbit-chains-unlock-privacy-and-new-use-cases-for-arbitrum-infra-6\"></a>Orbit chains unlock privacy and new use cases for Arbitrum infra</h3>\n<p>As Web3 matures out of Wild West casino culture, the below applications offer valuable niches for commercially sustainable projects and long-term value creation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The UX of blockchain applications with gas fees, bridging, and data transparency has made it tricky to build many applications, especially for B2B tech which often requires data privacy and where paying customers and users are often different people.<br>\nBut now, chains with customisable privacy like Orbit chains that can settle to a universal trust layer offer a powerful unlock, especially when we consider AI-powered products and features with onchain computing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The evolution of the gig economy also serves as a driving force for CollabTech applications onchain. Protocols to connect recruitment markets and contracting for small tasks and fluid teams benefit from eliminating web2 walled gardens, so that matchmaking is unrestricted and reputation portable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally, inventory and account management (ERP), CRMs, permission and access systems, and data management systems currently suffer from high platform risks (single points-off-failure vendors capriciously changing the system, pivoting or going bankrupt), architectures that only enable integrations as an afterthought, and closed source code which creates trust issues and limits the ability of customers to customize or build on top.<br>\nThese legacy collaboration tools can be disrupted through modularity &amp; composability, trustlessness, and easy automation, providing a great use case for blockchain-based dApps and protocols.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, unlocking autonomous agents within B2B tooling has unique advantages for planning, coordination, and resource efficiency. Pairing AI with blockchains as data layer and transaction layer enables trustlessness, automation, and advanced governance and permissioning to power the organizations of tomorrow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"improving-ops-and-governance-for-arbitrum-projects-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#improving-ops-and-governance-for-arbitrum-projects-7\"></a>Improving Ops and Governance for Arbitrum Projects</h3>\n<p>CollabTech is a key enabler for other projects. Early examples show how the existence of a quality multi-sig solution was key for increasing TVL in L1s and L2s as well as enabling projects to operate effectively.</p>\n<p>More recently, we cite the importance of protocols for decision-making, role attribution, grant tracking, creating quests, etc., as key for enabling ArbitrumDAO and Arbitrum-based projects to move fast, build strong communities, and achieve results.</p>\n<p>By leveraging tools for voting, proposal management, and consensus-building, collaboration technology empowers communities to steer projects with unprecedented transparency and democratic engagement. It enables collective decision-making and governance beyond the confines of traditional hierarchical systems. As the backbone of decentralized projects, collaboration technology not only streamlines governance processes but also enhances operational efficiency, making it indispensable for sustaining the growth and resilience of Web3 initiatives.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"positive-social-impact-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#positive-social-impact-8\"></a>Positive Social Impact</h3>\n<p>Thanks to web3 innovations, CollabTech is a key vertical to addressing the $8.8 trillion lost per year in employee disengagement, the incredibly low trust in Institutions, and the chronic opportunity cost attributable to poor coordination.</p>\n<p>It eradicates barriers to participation, ensuring that every stakeholder has a voice in shaping the future. Moreover, this technology fosters a culture of open collaboration and innovation, where ideas can be shared and refined collectively. CollabTech opens up new business opportunities, creates jobs, and promotes a more inclusive economic model where value is distributed more equitably among contributors leading to a more sustainable and resilient digital economy.</p>\n<p>The challenges of current DAO designs led many idealists to temper their excitement, but the opportunity to reinvent democracy, make governments transparent instead of corrupt, build the future of work, and improve the lives of billions is still there for the taking.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ideal-springboard-to-innovate-in-venture-building-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ideal-springboard-to-innovate-in-venture-building-9\"></a>Ideal Springboard to Innovate in Venture Building</h3>\n<p>There is a lack of supply of legitimate web3 companies opening new real markets. To solve this problem, we need to grow the industry’s capacity to develop new commercially viable projects. One of the ways in which we can address this is by leveraging venture builder models to create small clusters of complementary ventures, thereby creating a flywheel.</p>\n<p>Once you have several projects that define a category in a certain location, investors become acquainted with it and provide more funding. Once there is funding it becomes more attractive for entrepreneurs to choose to build towards it, compounding network effects.</p>\n<p>One can argue that CollabTech is not the most popular area in Arbitrum. However, if you want to push the boundaries to improve how we develop new commercially viable projects, CollabTech is possibly the best vertical to play with because of the natural deep expertise of the community there on how to collaborate.</p>\n<p>Even if you ignore all the potential benefits of improving Ops and Governance in the Arbitrum DAO and Arbiturm-based projects, and discount all the on-chain activity of the resulting ventures, the CollabTech community is still particularly well-positioned to reinvent venture building and generate models, tools, and methods to replicate the approach across verticals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"an-opportunity-for-vertical-specialization-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#an-opportunity-for-vertical-specialization-10\"></a>An Opportunity for Vertical Specialization</h3>\n<p>There was a time when you could know every major project in Ethereum. That time is long gone. The number of projects and innovations is expanding rapidly in verticals like DeFi, Gaming, DeSci, CollabTech, NFTs/creative, etc. Without specialisation, it’s impossible to keep up and this situation will only intensify over the next few years as the number of projects and verticals increases.</p>\n<p>Specialization enables the support system for ventures to keep up with new developments and add real value. Every vertical has a different technical palette, market configuration, and social network; with specialized support, we’re in the best position to select which projects to back and help them navigate challenges.</p>\n<p>CollabTech has especially suffered from neglect in specialization. Organization design, leadership, group psychology, behavioral economics, and political science are not new disciplines. Yet the DAO movement has often reinvented the wheel and repeated mistakes while being slow to test ideas coming from self-management, cybernetics, and similar bodies of value-aligned theories and practices.</p>\n<p>In Web2, we have seen how, in CollabTech, older and more experienced entrepreneurs have higher chances of success (in contrast to consumer verticals). This is due in large part to CollabTech being a B2B market where relationships carry a premium and a deep understanding of the complexities of organisations is key to developing commercially viable solutions. In CollabTech, the experience and networks that specialisation enables are particularly valuable.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-11\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Collaboration Technology stands as a blue ocean market, fertile ground for developing new use cases for Arbiturm products (especially Orbit Chains), and a bedrock upon which the Arbitrum ecosystem—and indeed, the broader Web3 landscape—can thrive. From enhancing operations and governance to optimizing resource allocation and task coordination, its role is pivotal. It not only fosters innovation and competitive advantage but also drives significant economic and social impacts. Finally, CollabTech is an ideal vertical to validate the Swarms approach (which can then be copied across verticals) and provide network effects for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>As such, prioritizing robust development and support for Collaboration Technology is not merely an option but a necessity for the sustained growth and resilience of the Web3 economy. By doing so, we ensure a future where digital collaboration is not just efficient but transformative, creating an inclusive, dynamic, and equitable ecosystem for all participants.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/is-collabtech-valuable-for-arbitrum/24703\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/is-collabtech-valuable-for-arbitrum/24703","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Jun 2024 14:57:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24703"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/is-collabtech-valuable-for-arbitrum/24703.rss","#text":"Is CollabTech valuable for Arbitrum?"},"filter":false},{"title":"Analysing impact and performance of previous ARB incentive programs (STIP, Backfund, LTIPP) - LTIPP Research bounty - PYOR","dc:creator":"PYOR","category":"LTIPP Bounties","description":"<p><strong>Our Proposal</strong><br>\nWe are proposing to analyse the impact of the three incentive programs run by the Arbitrum DAO and measure their impact on the eco-system and ROI. This will be achieved by analysing the pre and post-incentive performance of Grantees. Key areas that will be addressed are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Analysing growth in the user base and cross-usage of protocols amongst users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analysing changes in user behaviour and frequency: Avg no of transactions per user, fee per user</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analysing the cost of acquiring users through CAC and the payback period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Calculate the lifetime value (LTV) of users and LTV / CAC ratio.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analysing the quality of users through retention cohorts and repeat ratios.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build and analyse the behaviour of various Grantee segments (By scale, size and business category). Segments will be made by dividing Grantees into groups with similar characteristics or behaviours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Benchmarking of ARB eco-system metrics with comparable L2s across metrics and protocol activity.

Incentive spend constitutes a significant portion of the foundation’s spend and allocating it for the right projects is most important for the long-term growth of the ecosystem. Our work will answer the following questions amongst several others:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the ideal set of protocols for DAO to fund and support through Grants based on their Sector, Scale and traction? Understand if DAO should double down on established protocols or if DAO should make bets on newer projects. Or DAO should fund a DEX or a lending protocol etc.</li>\n<li>What is the optimal size of the grant to generate maximum impact?</li>\n<li>What is the ROI of various segments and who were the best-performing and worst-performing segments/grantees?</li>\n<li>For a sample set of sectors analyse why they underperformed or overperformed through analysis and discussions with Grantees/community members.</li>\n<li>Create a leaderboard of performers based on varied sets of metrics e.g. which segments created the most sticky users (best retention cohorts), which segments are driving Daily active user growth, and which segments drive maximum TVL.</li>\n<li>What sectors DAO should attract and fund more based upon the sector performance on Arbitrum vs sector performance on another ecosystem? Identifying market demand for certain protocols, mechanisms, and profit-driven actions</li>\n<li>What were the unique incentivization strategies implemented by the Protocols to attract new and recurring users? and what other protocols can be learned from it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Methodology</strong><br>\nWe will segment Grantees based on different parameters and will conduct Pre and Post analysis of those segments for all 3 programs(STIP/ Backfund STIP and LTIPP).</p>\n<p><strong>Segments for Grantees</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Based on sectors<br>\nProtocols will be aggregated based on the services they offer.<br>\nMajor categories will be</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Dexes</li>\n<li>Perps</li>\n<li>Lending / Borrowing</li>\n<li>Options</li>\n<li>CDPs</li>\n<li>Yield</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Based on the size of the Grant</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the predefined quantitative methodology, protocols will be divided into ‘High’, ‘Medium’ and ‘Low’ categories.</li>\n<li>The methodology for the categorization will be documented and presented separately.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Based on the protocol Size/scale/recency (when was the protocol launched)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the predefined quantitative methodology, protocols will be divided into ‘Large’, ‘Medium’ and ‘Small’ categories.</li>\n<li>The methodology for the categorization will be documented and presented separately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Metrics for performance analysis for protocols and segments</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cumulative users</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculate the total users who have used the protocol and ARB since inception</li>\n<li>Monthly breakdown of new vs existing users showing how many new users were acquired in each week</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Daily and monthly active users:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily Active Users (DAU)</li>\n<li>Monthly Active Users (MAU)</li>\n<li>Ratio of DAU / MAU</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Breakdown of DAU, MAU &amp; DAU/MAU by new vs existing users:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>New to the respective protocol</li>\n<li>New to Arbitrium</li>\n<li>Existing users of Arbitrium.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Breakdown of DAU, MAU &amp; DAU/MAU by new vs existing users:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Retention cohorts for each protocol and overall for the ARB ecosystem show retention at 1W, 2W, 4W, and 8W.</li>\n<li>Frequency: Analyse the Average number of transactions per week per user for Protocol and Arbitrium.</li>\n<li>Economics: Analyse trends in Average fee per transaction for protocol and overall Arbitrium.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Analyse trends in user behaviour and activity by segmenting users based on :</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Existing vs New wallets</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Age of Wallet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Based on the ARB balance in the wallet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Did they hold ARB before the program</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nature/business of dapps interacted with e.g. Dexes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nature of activity mercenary miners, institutional investors, traders etc</p>\n<p>(Segments for this section will be defined quantitatively and documented appropriately with the reasoning behind the decisions.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Analyse the overlap between the Protocols that received grants in STIP and LTIPP:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Segment users by how many protocols they interacted with e.g. 1, 2, 3 etc</li>\n<li>Analyse the difference in the business performance of wallets which interacted with different numbers of Protocols (Retention, behaviour, metrics).

It expands on existing discussions/designs of “DAO Owned Liquidations” for CDP protocols. Liquidations are always prevented by automatically pulling more collateral from the DAO treasury, increasing the collateral ratio of the loan.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pilot-phase-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pilot-phase-3\"></a>Pilot Phase</h3>\n<p>This pilot is designed to give the DAO sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding borrowing stablecoins against assets in the treasury, and the confidence to use our proposed solution safely.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum community is seeking ways to more efficiently and effectively use the capital in the treasury. The strategies for grant programs, Mergers and Acquisitions, long term investments, and treasury sustainability seek sustainable solutions that minimize required sell pressure on the ARB token.</p>\n<p>The treasury currently has about $3.8B USD worth of ARB tokens. Long term diversification of this is key, but the community also needs access to capital now for grants, treasury management, M&amp;A, and more. Developing an alternative strategy for accessing stablecoins gives Arbitrum DAO more options and power.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-terms-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-5\"></a>Key Terms</h1>\n<p>CDP - Collateralized Debt Position. A type of financial primitive used by protocol like Maker, Open Dollar, Reflexer, etc… Collateral backs stablecoins with required loan to value ratios.</p>\n<p>Liquidation - an event which happens when the value of collateral backing a loan is less than the value of the loan, or below a required threshold. This forces the collateral to be sold in order to pay back the debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<p>The DAO should have the option to borrow stablecoins against its ARB and other future assets. However, using traditionally structured lending protocols creates too much risk of liquidation. Our proposed solution is a Treasury Backed Vault that severely limits the liquidation risks and lets the community achieve its goals with open access to its capital.</p>\n<p>Liquidations are mitigated by a “savior module” connected to a CDP position. The savior module adds an additional step between a vault being marked for liquidation and becoming liquidated. The module automatically pulls more ARB tokens directly from the DAO treasury (or elsewhere), adds them to the collateral of the position until it is raised above the liquidation threshold, and completely prevents liquidations from occurring. Any time liquidation on the DAO’s position is called, the savior activates first. The module contract would be given an allowance of ARB tokens by the Treasury to spend, allowing the Arbitrum DAO to completely control and at any time update the bounds of how many tokens can be pulled from the treasury.</p>\n<p>Example usage of Treasury Backed Vaults:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO deposits 1,000,000 ARB, worth $1,500,000 in a CDP protocol like Open Dollar or others where Treasury Backed Vaults are enabled.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO gives a TBV savior module permission to spend an additional 1,000,000 ARB, which remains in the DAO treasury. The DAO sets parameters with the savior.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO borrows 1,000,000 stablecoins worth $1,000,000</li>\n<li>Due to market conditions, the price of ARB drops 33% suddenly, and the position is under the required collateralization ratio. It is now up for liquidation.</li>\n<li>Anyone calls the public function to liquidate the position. The vault is marked for liquidation.</li>\n<li>Before liquidation occurs, the savior module is automatically called. It has been set with specific parameters by the DAO to pull an additional 1,000,000 ARB from the treasury and deposit it in the vault.</li>\n<li>The position now has 2,000,000 ARB deposited in it, and is safely over the collateralization requirements. No liquidation happens and no additional votes were required to manage the position safely.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"steps-to-implement-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-7\"></a>Steps to Implement</h1>\n<p>The implementation is essentially split into 4 phases</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Research and Development</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A team of 3 solidity developers design, build, and document Treasury Backed Vaults with support for Arbitrum DAO specifically in mind.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Risk Analysis</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A team of 2 financial analysts complete a report on suggested parameters and the greater ecosystem impact of different borrowing scenarios for Arbitrum DAO. This will come with many helpful recommendations that future delegates can lean on to make proposals to use the vaults how they choose.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Audit</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A public audit contest will be conducted and managed by our team to review the security of the smart contracts of the TBV. This is important to complete at this stage because we want the DAO to be able to feel confident in the readiness of the system. A formal security report will be published and summarized in a post to the DAO. Audit reward recipients will be required to complete compliance and KYC before receiving funds.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Reporting</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the end of the pilot a report will be made to the DAO that includes results of the security audit, documentation on using TBVs, and results of the risk analysis. The report will include recommendations like how much ARB should be allowed to be pulled by a TBV to limit risk, how many stablecoins could safely be borrowed at a time if the DAO should choose to use the TBVs, how much sell pressure on ARB could be avoided in different scenarios, suggested collateralization settings, and other parameters for real usage.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-8\"></a>Timeline</h1>\n<p>Overall time to project completion: ~2.5 months</p>\n<p>Research and Development, done asynchronous with risk analysis reporting: 1.5 months</p>\n<p>Security audit and reporting: 2 weeks</p>\n<p>Complete report for the DAO and documentation on usage: 2 weeks</p>\n<h1><a name=\"team-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#team-9\"></a>Team</h1>\n<p>Research and development will be completed by a designated team made up on contributors to Open Dollar and led specifically by <a href=\"https://github.com/cupojoseph\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CupOjoseph</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/pi0neerpat\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pi0neerpat</a>.

We aim to empower our developer base and secure Arbitrum as a leading force in innovation and growth within the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Born out of the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-6-builder-pathways-towards-adoption/21510\">Betting on Builders</a> proposal from GovHack at ETHDenver 2024, we are presenting a collaborative accelerator program strategy, expected to run from Q3FY2024 through Q4FY2025. This strategy acts as a proof-of-concept for a pathway that any accelerator initiative can participate in. To begin, <a href=\"https://www.evmcapital.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EVM Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rndao.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RnDAO</a> and <a href=\"https://outlierventures.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Outlier Ventures</a> are partnering on this proposal to launch the initiative, collect data, and establish best practices.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this document is to detail our understanding of the current landscape, present a vision for advancement, propose a practical strategy, and provide specific outcomes and KPIs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thankarb-a-strategy-framework-platform-for-arbitrum-s-success/19130\">ThankARB</a>, which gathered data from 15,000 respondents within the ecosystem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We have more developers than most chains, but we don’t currently know how to best mobilize them for the benefit of the ecosystem.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We would like to try our hand at answering this question. Some opportunities for developer mobilization, which we intend to enhance with the “Infinite Launchpad” include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhancing Builder Onboarding and Support</strong>: Offering highly-tailored support at all stages (Idea through Series A) will prepare projects for commercial success or investment.</li>\n<li><strong>Creating Positive Feedback Loops</strong>: As Arbitrum’s technological stack evolves, builders can leverage the technology and benefit from their own contributions to its advancement, ensuring a symbiotic progression for both the platform and the projects it supports.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical support and product feedback</strong>: Providing technical guidance and iterative feedback is invaluable during the transition from alpha/beta stages to full project launches.</li>\n<li><strong>Enterprise contracts and funding</strong>: Providing subsequent funding opportunities for mature projects. While initial grants facilitate early-stage development, there is a void in support for scaling projects to a level where they can attract significant enterprise interest and investment, crucial for long-term sustainability and impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>To address these needs, we are asking the DAO to allot $10m in ARB from Q3FY2024 through Q4FY2025 for a program to enhance the Arbitrum developer and startup ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This initiative is designed to aid our ecosystem of developers, startups, and enterprises by providing a clear incubation track that propels innovations that include but are not limited to governance, process automation/ AI, financial infrastructure, and on-chain reputation through the help of direct collaborations with 100+ commercial partners.</p>\n<p>As teams go through the Programs, we can onboard them as Arbitrum customers, integrate them with the software stack, platforms or protocols, and support them as they become adopted in the ecosystem. If the product has significant traction, we can assess bringing them deeper into the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>How this fits into <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thankarb-a-strategy-framework-platform-for-arbitrum-s-success/19130\">Arbitrums strategic priorities</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Robust DevRel</strong>: Establishing a custom-tiered DevRel program with robust, accessible, and responsive tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance optimization</strong>: Identifying and iteratively improving key capabilities to increase DAO performance and accountability.</li>\n<li><strong>Future-proofing</strong>: Strengthening our capacity to scale Arbitrum software adoption.</li>\n<li><strong>Growing the community</strong>: Awareness, participation, efficient inquiry handling, and bias reduction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional key value opportunities for Arbitrum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Developer feedback</strong>: As the incubated projects build on Arbitrum, we can collect direct and honest feedback to be distributed to Offchain labs, Arbitrum Foundation, and other stakeholders to refine their roadmap and improve Arbitrum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Builder representation and visibility</strong>: Showcasing teams composed of individuals representing their given region, background and culture - building with Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mutual reputation building</strong>: Participating teams can enhance their credibility by claiming involvement in an Arbitrum-funded accelerator program, while also promoting the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaborative research and knowledge sharing</strong>: Research findings will be shared as insight reports, highlighting market opportunities and supporting ongoing learning and improvement for all DAO working groups (M&amp;A, Arbitrum Ventures Initiative, Foundation Grants program, Questbook programs, etc). This can be used as a public good to refine the ecosystem’s approach and de-risk capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alpha</strong>: The early development stage of a product, typically for internal testing and refinement.</li>\n<li><strong>Beta</strong>: When a more advanced version of a product is released to a broader audience for testing and feedback before the official launch.</li>\n<li><strong>Series A</strong>: When startups begin to raise capital to scale their business after the initial seed stage.</li>\n<li><strong>GTM</strong>: “Got-to-Market” strategy and execution plan for launching a startup’s product and acquiring customers.</li>\n<li><strong>MVP</strong>: “Minimum viable product” the simplest version of a product to gather feedback for future development.</li>\n<li><strong>PoC</strong>: “Proof of Concept” stage where startups validate the feasibility and viability of their product or technology.</li>\n<li><strong>EiR</strong>: Entrepreneur in Residence” an experienced entrepreneur who provides mentorship, strategic guidance, and assistance in establishing valuable business connections.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The “Betting on Builders” suite of programs work together to support projects at any stage of their journey, guiding them seamlessly from inception through Series A and beyond.

This post is aimed at sharing the technical details of this process. We share it after a technical deep dive pursued by ScopeLift, in collaboration with Tally and other Arbitrum stakeholders.</p>\n<p>No specific action is required by community members at this time. Instead, we share this post for transparency purposes, and welcome any feedback or questions the community might have.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"technical-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#technical-summary-1\"></a>Technical Summary</h3>\n<p>ScopeLift will upgrade the Arbitrum Core Governor and the Arbitrum Treasury Governor. The new Governors will have the same feature set as the current Governors with the following additional features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proposal Cancellation</strong>: During the proposal delay phase, before the voting period has started, the delegate who put the proposal onchain will have the right to cancel it. This means voting on the proposal will not proceed. This feature comes in handy in many scenarios, notably in the instance that a malformed proposal is submitted in error. In such a case, the situation can be rectified without a mass effort to notify delegates to vote against it.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible Voting</strong>: We will add ScopeLift’s <a href=\"https://flexiblevoting.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">extension</a> to the Governor which allows delegates to cast rolling, fractional votes. This is most useful when smart contract delegates are used to roll up the votes of many pooled token holders. Use cases this extension will enable include voting with tokens in DeFi, shielded voting, voting from Orbit chains, and more. Note that this extension has been <a href=\"https://blog.openzeppelin.com/scopelift-flexible-voting-audit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audited</a> and will soon be <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/5045\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">part of</a> the OZ standard Governor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ScopeLift will <strong>not</strong> upgrade the Governors using the proxy upgradeable contract pattern. The contracts will <strong>not</strong> be upgraded in place by pointing the proxies to a new implementation. Upgrades via proxy are less flexible, more time consuming, and more error prone. In the case of the Governors, a superior upgrade path is available, as described below.</p>\n<p>ScopeLift will first assemble and extensively test new Governor contracts. The contracts will be audited, then deployed on Arbitrum One. ScopeLift will then coordinate with <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Frisson</a> as the delegate who will submit proposals to each existing Governor which will transfer the proposer role on the Timelock contracts to the new Governors.</p>\n<p>If the proposals pass and execute, the new Governors will become the entry point for Arbitrum Governance moving forward. The old Governors will continue to exist onchain, but will be vestigial, with no ability to actually execute proposals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"faq-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#faq-2\"></a>FAQ</h3>\n<p>This approach might raise a number of questions. We will attempt to anticipate and answer them below.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: How will delegates know to propose and vote through the new Governors after the upgrade?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Upgrading Governors by transferring Timelock ownership is a common pattern, and Tally is set up to handle it. Immediately after the upgrade executes, Tally will be updated to use the new Governor contracts, while all historical vote data sourced from the old Governors will still be visible in the client.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Won’t upgrading the Governors require moving the treasury and assigning protocol permissions to the new contracts?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. The Timelock contracts hold the Treasury ETH and protocol permissions, because the Timelock is the contract that ultimately executes Governance proposals. This allows us to upgrade the Governors (where virtually all the logic related to governance lives) without needing to move funds or reassign protocol permissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: How will other Governance proposals be impacted by the upgrade?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Any proposal that executes before the upgrade proposal will not be impacted, even if voting on the upgrade proposal has already begun. Any proposal that is either queued or being voted on when the upgrade proposal executes could be left in limbo<sup>1</sup>. For this reason, we suggest the DAO plan to avoid non-critical proposals during the upgrade voting window.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will the new contracts be proxy upgradeable?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. Although using proxy upgradeability is not preferred in general, there are scenarios where it might be the right tool for the job. For example, adding a simple view method to the Governor might best be accomplished through a small proxy upgrade. Leaving this tool in the DAO’s toolbox is helpful. Thus, the new Governor contracts will be deployed as Transparent Proxies, using the same Proxy Admin as the existing contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will customizations made by Arbitrum to the Governor contracts be carried forward to the new Governors?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. Namely, the new Governor will have all the features provided by the extension from which it <a href=\"https://www.contractreader.io/contract/arbitrum/0x065620d99e1785ccf56fa95462d3012eb844fdc9#l2arbitrumgovernor-1-30-25\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">inherits</a>. It will also have the custom <code>onlyOwner</code> <a href=\"https://www.contractreader.io/contract/arbitrum/0x065620d99e1785ccf56fa95462d3012eb844fdc9#l2arbitrumgovernor-1-30-105\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">relay functionality</a>, and the fractional quorum which <a href=\"https://www.contractreader.io/contract/arbitrum/0x065620d99e1785ccf56fa95462d3012eb844fdc9#l2arbitrumgovernor-1-30-127\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">excludes specific tokens</a> from the quorum calculation.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is upgrading the Governors risky?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: If done carelessly, a botched upgrade could certainly cause problems. This is why ScopeLift will exercise great care in performing the upgrade.</p>\n<p>In particular, ScopeLift will assemble the new Governor using the latest version the OpenZeppelin contracts upgradeable library, along with ScopeLift’s fully audited Flexible Voting extension. We will then write a large suite of tests and simulations to ensure the upgrade will be successful, and that all DAO operations will be able to proceed normally after it is completed.</p>\n<p>Based on our previous experience with Gitcoin, PoolTogether, Radworks, and others, we expect this test suite will include hundreds of tests and thousands of lines of code.</p>\n<p>These tests simulate the upgrade to the new Governor, from deployment, proposal, Governance vote, and future votes by the DAO. The tests run on a “forked” state from Arbitrum One to simulate the closest possible production state. They exercise all scenarios before and after the upgrade, and ensure governance will still function properly after it is completed.</p>\n<p>We will also write scripts for deploying the new Governor and for submitting a proposal for the upgrade to the existing Governor. The scripts will be exercised by the tests.</p>\n<p>All tests and simulations are specific to Arbitrum. They exercise the actual code that is live on the network in a simulated environment. They will ensure the upgraded Governor can manage the DAO treasury and execute its role within the protocol.</p>\n<p>These tests will be written as fuzz tests and invariant tests, meaning they will take random arbitrary inputs rather than hardcoded parameters. We will execute millions of scenarios through these tests before proceeding.</p>\n<p>The entire codebase will be carefully audited by the OpenZeppelin team before being deployed. Finally, the tests will also be updated to run with the actual, deployed bytecode, and with the proposal calldata, once both are live onchain.</p>\n<p>ScopeLift has executed on this process for other DAOs. With these safeguards in place, we are confident the upgrade can be completed with minimal risk and without disruption to the DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"timeline-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-3\"></a>Timeline</h3>\n<p>ScopeLift has already begun preliminary work on this process, and will be accelerating on it in the weeks ahead. We are aiming to complete the work by the end of June, such that the contracts can be audited in early July. The DAO should expect a proposal for the upgrade to be submitted in mid-July at the earliest.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><sup>1</sup> It is, in fact, possible to graft old proposal state onto the new governor so that even mid-flight proposals stay valid. This approach would increase complexity and risk, and on balance, we don’t find it worthwhile vs. the alternative, i.e. a short window during which no new proposals should be created.</p>\n

Workshops to provide insights on best practices in order to help the Arbitrum DAO distribute grant funding for scalable, impactful growth.</p>\n<p>Our invite-only participants have demonstrated great interest in managing their own grant programs, in areas of their expertise, through our application process and our goal is to not only empower their mission, but to also help facilitate the intricacies within the grant funding process.</p>\n<p>For our introductory Planning Grants Workshop, we covered various topics to kick off our thought process behind planning grant programs:</p>\n<p>Planning Grant Workshop Overview section was to go over the high-level goals and details that come with it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rewarding participants for further refining their grant program proposals, claimable at end of ThankARB Season 10</li>\n<li>Attending our Workshops to assure alignment with ThankARB &amp; Arbitrum DAO</li>\n<li>Not guaranteed for future funding - ThankARB is selecting 10 to 15 programs to fund</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We went over our Timeline to give grant program managers an idea of how long we expect these programs to run.</p>\n<p></p><div

Our grants are funded in $ARB so we emphasize the need to plan accordingly</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For our last topic, we focused on scalability. It’s important for our grant program managers to demonstrate scalability with their program. If they received 10x the funding, would they be able to achieve 10x the results or more? We ask our grant program managers to think about the scalability of their programs and consider the potential impact they could make for the Arbitrum DAO as the ecosystem continues to grow.</p>\n<p>We are looking to make drastic improvements within the DAO ecosystem, and in order to do so we intend to focus on winners by scaling their programs as much as they can.</p>\n<p>All in all, we’re extremely grateful for the participation in these meetings as it helps us not only understand the thoughts behind these amazing grant program ideas but to also reflect on potential hurdles and avenues of improvement. The Arbitrum DAO has an endless pool of exceptional talent and we have full intention to harness that talent for the betterment of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We can’t wait to review the refined proposals, select our grantees, and roll out these grant programs to help fund &amp; scale our Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Onward &amp; upward.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/planning-grants-workshops-hosted-by-thank-arb/24535\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/planning-grants-workshops-hosted-by-thank-arb/24535","pubDate":"Thu, 30 May 2024 17:57:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24535"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/planning-grants-workshops-hosted-by-thank-arb/24535.rss","#text":"Planning Grants Workshops - Hosted by Thank ARB"},"filter":false},{"title":"Proposal: The Startup Collective - Ecosystem Growth in Arbitrum.","dc:creator":"scollen","category":"Proposals","description":"<p>This proposal is the work of the team behind <a href=\"https://elixircapital.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Elixir Capital</a> in collaboration with members of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

This proposal establishes the Arbitrum Startup Collective, a comprehensive program designed to accelerate and bring capital to promising early-stage startups building on or migrating to the Arbitrum protocol and its related product suite.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has successfully launched several initiatives to attract new users and liquidity to Arbitrum through initiatives like grant programs for idea-stage and pre-seed startups (e.g RnDAO, PL, etc), and incentive programs (STIP, Backfund, LTIPP) for later-stage players and established protocols.</p>\n<p>Building on this success, the Arbitrum ecosystem is now ready to explore other models (not grant-based) for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling startups beyond early stages: Supporting the growth of ventures that emerge from existing programs.</li>\n<li>Attracting top teams building on Arbitrum: Enticing high-caliber startups, particularly those in the Seed to Series A stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In collaboration with the Arbitrum DAO, the current founders’ community, and the wider stakeholders; our initiative will aim to support and invest in up to 150 high-potential startups at the Seed to Series A stage and across verticals in the Arbitrum ecosystem over a three year period.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivations-2\"></a>Motivations</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>New model for ecosystem development</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the current up-cycle in the industry, there is a tremendous opportunity for growth and innovation. New market cycles bring higher token prices, which historically attract new builders and new users. Data from <a href=\"https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=22411-monthly-active-open-source-developers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Electric capital’s developer report</a> shows that the number of developers grew 3x during the 2021 bull market and grew 10x in the 2017 bull market.</p>\n<p>Ethereum aside, Polygon and Solana are the top two ecosystems which have attracted more developers than any other ecosystem. Both have been amongst the most active in running venture-style ecosystem development programs such as the Polygon Accelerator, the Polygon Venture fund, the Polygon Village initiative, the Solana Ecosystem Fund, Solana Hackers House, and the Solana Super Team initiatives.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Why does Arbitrum need this initiative?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Arbitrum requires strategic investment initiatives to maintain its rapid growth and solidify its position as a leading ecosystem. While Arbitrum has achieved impressive success with a strong user base and Total Value Locked (TVL), competitors like Optimism and Polygon have deployed significantly more capital to fuel their ecosystem growth. Today, there are programs tackling both ends of the start-up growth spectrum in the Arbitrum ecosystem (refer diagram below) but it seems there is a clear gap at the Seed to Series A level.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hWV1uesBBQ3Gj0DEdWuBdbAHLmO.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_449x164.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hWV1uesBBQ3Gj0DEdWuBdbAHLmO\" width=\"449\" height=\"164\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_449x164.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_673x246.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_898x328.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D6E0E9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Building a successful venture ecosystem cannot rely solely on capital deployed; it is about enabling existing participants, providing structured value creation &amp; support to new participants, and creating hyper-connectivity - that ultimately reinforces a powerful ecosystem growth flywheel.</p>\n<p>Leading startup accelerators like Y Combinator and Techstars demonstrate the power of structured programs. These programs cultivate vibrant communities where startups collaborate, invest in each other, and attract top talent, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth (e.g Paypal “mafia” - the initial group of people who were with PayPal during its early days and that went on to establish influential companies like Tesla, SpaceX, LinkedIn, YouTube, Yelp, and many more).</p>\n<p>The proposed Arbitrum Startup Collective targets strategic investments in up to 150 Arbitrum-focused companies at Seed to Series A stage with a comprehensive support program. This approach stimulates network effects, attracting talent while providing startups with a compelling capital and value creation proposition.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective will activate existing builders and ecosystem participants to serve as mentors and experts, while our team will be responsible for program management, community building across several regions, and founders’ support initiatives. This proposal is a long-term investment that will create lasting value within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>By establishing this Arbitrum Startup Collective now, Arbitrum can continue to solidify its leadership position and propel the network to explosive growth.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What is the expected impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ecosystem funds have historically played a crucial role as growth catalysts for emerging protocols and ecosystems, especially for the growth of developers and decentralized applications (dApps). As a result, new wallets have emerged, contributing to the growth of total value locked (TVL) and ultimately driving growth of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We believe that the Arbitrum Startup Collective will help achieve the following objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funnel capital into the best start-ups building on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Drive adoption of Arbitrum among developers and dApps</li>\n<li>Provide high quality diligence and support to reputable (Web2 &amp; Web3) investors to deploy in Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Geographical diversification and stronger localization in key regions</li>\n<li>Increase the Arbitrum DAO treasury through investments returns</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"initiative-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#initiative-summary-3\"></a>Initiative Summary</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective aims to supercharge the ecosystem by fueling promising startups, attracting developers and dApps, driving more capital into the ecosystem, and ultimately maximizing returns for the Arbitrum DAO treasury.</p>\n<p>a- Growth stage:</p>\n<p>The initiative is designed to tackle three stages of growth to cover the startup lifecycle and provide optimal impact to the Arbitrum ecosystem through tracks of support and investing:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9cbe08baf60fd2f878c6408aa5db48aef94e4c1d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/mmBD9MCjVmTiet2DPrbmTCXNP8V.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9cbe08baf60fd2f878c6408aa5db48aef94e4c1d.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"mmBD9MCjVmTiet2DPrbmTCXNP8V\" width=\"624\" height=\"363\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"EBECE8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The program is envisioned as a three-year initiative. This timeframe acknowledges the maturity cycle of accelerator models and allows for cross-fertilization between different programs within the Startup Collective (e.g., scout program feeding into scale and follow-on programs).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Scout Program (Pre-Seed Focus): To identify the most promising founders in the ecosystem, we propose to leverage a Scout Network composed of experienced entrepreneurs and angel investors deeply familiar with the Arbitrum ecosystem. These scouts significantly extend the reach by leveraging their networks and industry knowledge to uncover innovative ideas before a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Scouts get access to promising startups through various channels, including inbound, referrals through their network, and industry events. This proactive approach allows us to spot ventures before traditional funding rounds, ensuring we capture the most disruptive and impactful ideas for the Arbitrum ecosystem and serve as a feeder to the Scale Program (described below).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scale Program (Seed to Series A stage): These companies already have a product with early users, or demonstrate early signs of success. Seed funding rounds are typically led by venture capitalists to complete product launches and refine growth models. Alongside a capital investment, the Arbitrum Startup Collective offers a structured program to provide additional support and value creation (details below). This program will go beyond just deploying capital and equip startups with the resources they need to thrive, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mentorship: Connect with experienced builders, advisors and mentors who will provide strategic guidance and industry insights.</li>\n<li>Network Access: Gain access to a network of investors, partners, and potential customers within the Arbitrum ecosystem and beyond.</li>\n<li>Technical Resources: Benefit from workshops, educational programs, and access to technical resources to accelerate product development.</li>\n<li>Community Building: Facilitate connections and collaboration between startups within the program and the broader Arbitrum community.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Follow-on (Series A+): For top performers from within the portfolio, the plan is to double down on winners to support them in later stages and maximize upside. Follow-on investments will be limited to companies coming from the Scout or Scale program described above who are proven to increase activity or adoption of Arbitrum</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>b- Geographical focus:</p>\n<p>The initial focus of this initiative will be on Europe, Middle East, and South Asia to allow us to leverage our existing expertise and connections within this region. Although the program is fully remote and there are no requirements for teams to be located at any specific place, there will be in person events organized during the program to drive more collaboration between the teams.</p>\n<p>c- Sector focus:</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective is not sector specific and would consider startups across various sectors as long as they build on or plan to integrate with Arbitrum technology. However, to avoid any overlap with the RnDAO or the GCP initiative, collaboration tools and gaming will be specifically excluded from the Arbitrum Startup Collective to avoid any overlap.</p>\n<p>Expected Outcome</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective is designed to achieve a lasting impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem by fostering a vibrant community of talented developers, entrepreneurs, and users. The key expected outcomes for this initiative include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Innovation: This initiative will act as a catalyst for the success of promising early-stage startups building on Arbitrum. We target up to 150 startups to join or grow in the Arbitrum ecosystem through this initiative. A high percentage of the portfolio companies will achieve significant milestones, generate user activity within the ecosystem, and potentially lead to the launch of groundbreaking startups.</li>\n<li>Network Growth: This initiative will contribute to the creation of a dynamic and engaged Arbitrum ecosystem and we expect the launch of over 10 Orbit chains, fostering a rich and diverse ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) built on Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Financial Returns: This initiative is designed to generate a strong return on investment for the Arbitrum DAO (structured as investments - not grants - with the Arbitrum DAO retaining upside). By strategically investing in high-growth companies and fostering a thriving ecosystem, we aim to deliver exceptional financial returns for the DAO upon the fund’s maturity.</li>\n<li>Attracting Capital: The success of this initiative in fostering innovation and attracting high-caliber startups is expected to generate significant interest from other investors. We anticipate securing co-investment and follow-on capital from these investors - further fueling the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By delivering on these ambitious yet attainable goals, the Arbitrum Startup Collective will propel Arbitrum to the forefront of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"program-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-details-4\"></a>Program Details</h1>\n<p>a- Scout Program</p>\n<p>Scouts are existing members of the Arbitrum DAO or community, experienced entrepreneurs with strong expertise in different domains, and likely already angel investors with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by early-stage founders inside and outside of Web3.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hOLJGGjmqT3gJCvnaxOKrvaDhlQ.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-31 at 18.43.41\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6_2_690x376.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-31 at 18.43.41\" data-base62-sha1=\"hOLJGGjmqT3gJCvnaxOKrvaDhlQ\" width=\"690\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6_2_690x376.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6_2_1035x564.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E3E5E2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Once elected, Scouts can invest capital into opportunities by following the process below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Submit an investment memo to the Arbitrum Startup Collective team</li>\n<li>The investment team will review if all investment criteria are met, including that capital is directed to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Arbitrum Startup Collective team will conduct expedited due diligence to ensure the capital is being appropriately allocated (e.g. sanctions, background checks, conflict of interest, etc) and other factors that maintain the reputation of the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>The Arbitrum Startup Collective team will review the legal documentation and ensure it is appropriate for such investment (priority will be given to simplicity and using market standard documentation when possible e.g predominantly SAFE, token warrants, and SAFTs as appropriate)</li>\n<li>Capital is deployed directly into the start-up by the Arbitrum Startup Collective investment vehicle</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: Please note that these are structured as investments, not grants. The investments are made through the Arbitrum Startup Collective investment vehicle which will have the Arbitrum DAO as its sole investor. The Arbitrum DAO will therefore retain exposure to the upside from these investments and will receive distributions upon exit.</p>\n<p>The Scouts will be incentivized and compensated for their contribution through an allocation of up to 10% of the upside generated from the investments attributed to them (i.e. if a scout refers a $50,000 investment that is subsequently exited with net proceeds of $500,000; that scout would receive $50,000 compensation).

This agreement will clearly define the scope of work, outlining Elixir Capital’s responsibilities in detail including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Startup identification, application process, and selection</li>\n<li>Cohort management and program delivery, including mentorship, workshops, and events</li>\n<li>Regular reporting and communication with the Arbitrum DAO Oversight Committee</li>\n<li>Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The service agreement will establish clear performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the service provider. Regular reviews will be conducted by the Arbitrum DAO (through the Oversight Committee) to assess performance against these metrics.</p>\n<p>The service provider’s compensation will be structured to incentivize strong performance and alignment with program goals. It is based on a fixed fee basis to cover core program management activities and is paid based on specific milestones.</p>\n<p>In the event of underperformance or non-compliance with the service agreement, the Arbitrum DAO will have the right to terminate the agreement with reasonable notice. A clear process for transitioning program management to a new service provider will be outlined within the agreement.</p>\n<p>Investment Agreement</p>\n<p>A separate investment agreement will govern the management of funds allocated to the Arbitrum Startup Collective. This agreement will establish a framework that ensures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investor Upside: The Arbitrum DAO, as the investor, retains upside generated from the program’s investments.</li>\n<li>Investment Management: Elixir Capital will be accountable for managing the deployed funds effectively, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio oversight, and exit strategies.</li>\n<li>Investor Liability Protection: The investment agreement will be structured to limit the liability of the Arbitrum DAO as the investor. It will function as a legal shield, protecting the DAO from potential liabilities arising from the fund’s activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the investment nature of the program, we will appoint a professional fund administrator (such as NAV Consulting, Formidium, etc) to manage the vehicle and ensure compliance with the investment agreement. This appointment offers several benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliance: The fund administrator ensures adherence to the investment agreement and relevant regulations.</li>\n<li>Transparency: They provide independent oversight and reporting on the investment portfolio.</li>\n<li>Risk Management: Fund administrators mitigate risks associated with fund operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The investment capital will be contributed to the investment vehicle following a capital call schedule which would likely be twice annually to fund program activities and investments. Upon successful exits, the generated returns and distributions will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO, the sole investor in the program. The investment agreement will include clawback provisions that allow the Arbitrum DAO to recoup investment funds if they are not invested within the investment period.</p>\n<p>The investment manager compensation will be structured to incentivize strong performance and alignment with program goals. It is based on a combination of a fixed management fee and a performance-based fee that incentivizes the investment manager to generate strong returns on the invested capital.</p>\n<p>Note: A formal contractual agreement ensures clarity, transparency, and accountability in the program’s execution and delivery.
