To date, RWAs represent a small percentage of Arbitrum’s builder activity, accounting for 1.1% of grants in 2023. It is critical for Arbitrum to take the lead and future-proof platform growth, especially when competitors like Polygon and Avalanche have made significant strides in tokenizing assets on their platforms.</p>\n<p>As promised, we are sharing the summary notes and resources from our session for those who were unable to attend or want to review! Additionally, we now have a dedicated TG channel for comms and questions on this keep topic (h/t Robin Nagpal).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To join the Arbitrum DAO RWA Group on Telegram, click <a href=\"https://t.me/+H0zCKfluNbliMDVh\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"i-key-highlights-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#i-key-highlights-2\"></a><strong>I. Key Highlights</strong></h2>\n<p>The session began with an introduction to the topic of RWAs and their relevance to Arbitrum,  followed by presentations from Devansh and PaperImperium of GFXLabs. After, we heard in-depth presentations from industry leaders Chainlink, Karpatkey, and Gauntlet. The 60-minute session concluded with an open-ended Q&amp;A period, allowing community members to engage directly on RWAs with these experts.

Check out this thread: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeepDAO_io/status/1790390075404038445\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/DeepDAO_io/status/1790390075404038445 </a></p>\n<p>Most of the top delegates – in the ecosystem at large – are getting delegators from Arbitrum and Optimism. A longer report is coming, and for now we looked at the top 5. A few insights are emerging:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Many of the top delegates are active in multiple DAOs. Clearly a good way to facilitate communication and partnerships, and also a potential source for conflict of interests.</li>\n<li>Looking at the top delegates is a good way to identify lesser known, up and coming DAOs, which draw their interest.

There are 6 protocols that were submitted late and will go through the snapshot voting process, 12 protocols that were challenged by delegates, and the rest were optimistically funded as there were no challenge snapshots posted for these protocols.</p>\n<p>Delegates can personalize the dashboard for themselves by creating a copy of the sheet, allowing them to update the status of voted proposals in the last column of the dashboard and see dynamic changes in cell background colours for the first four columns to track their own votes. (P.S. - Please note that while personal copies enable personalization, the sheet will not be updated for personal copies. The main public link remains active and is updated every 5 minutes for all community members.)</p>\n<p>I would love to receive feedback, suggestions, or any changes you would like to see in this

href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x66fd48c246080260275e60e327b4d14d3ca202c6d13aba17e970c55536b44664\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">snapshot vote</a>. We have been asked by the DAO to provide security considerations for voters when the proposal reaches its on-chain Tally vote. We have generally formed our review process from <a href=\"https://defisafety.com/documentation-09\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi Safety’s scoring process</a> to set expectations for Event Horizon’s security posture and make recommendations to mitigate risk.</p>\n<p>In the course of our review, we discussed many of our findings with the Event Horizon team and found their team to be responsive and helpful with our inquiries. We now share our findings and recommendations below to help the Event Horizon team improve their security stance and to better inform Arbitrum delegates on the potential risks that should be carefully considered before moving to an on-chain vote.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"review-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#review-summary-2\"></a>Review Summary</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"team-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#team-3\"></a>Team</h2>\n<p>The Event Horizon Team first began publishing work in July 2023. They have an active Discord and have been very responsive to user questions there and in other community forums. They have an active <a href=\"https://docs.eventhorizon.vote/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documentation site</a> which highlights their projects including DAO token staking. They have also written several blog articles about DAO governance on their blog.</p>\n<p>The Event Horizon team has been operating and participating in DAO voting for over a year. They have also recently received large-scale delegations from communities such as <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gitcoin</a>. It’s important to note that some of their <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/24#specification-6\">stated claims</a> of performance in other DAOs is based on voting activity, not total delegations. For example, they claim to be the “10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem” but they are only the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/delegates\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">108th largest delegate listed on Tally</a>. We point out this distinction to ensure that readers do not conflate active voter with total delegation rankings. The Event Horizon team also provided further clarification on the terminology used:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“voter” and “delegate” are clearly completely different terms. The clarification being a highlight that we don’t say “delegate” we say “voter” and voter is different than delegate. Many delegates have never voted. Aave as an example, the vast majority of the largest delegates are not <em>voters</em>. Again, given most large delegates haven’t voted or are “ghost delegates”, “voter” is the salient metric.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe encourage Arbitrum community members to be familiar with the team behind this proposal and fully understand the context and claims of their past performance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"code-documentation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#code-documentation-4\"></a>Code &amp; Documentation</h2>\n<p>The proposal’s voting system as described needs to aggregate votes and submit them on-chain by the described logic. All of this occurs today off-chain by code that is currently unavailable for scrutiny. The Event Horizon team did inform us that their architecture utilizes the <a href=\"https://docs.snapshot.org/tools/snapshot.js\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a> and <a href=\"https://apidocs.tally.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tally</a> SDK &amp; APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nOpenZeppelin believes strongly in the trust that comes from on-chain deployments and largely eschews projects where the code is not available. We encourage Event Horizon to deploy all of their voting logic on-chain and/or open up their architecture for public scrutiny before it goes live for usage on Arbitrum delegations. The Event Horizon stated their intent to address this recommendation with the following response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding documentation of off-chain systems, we’ll include it in our public documentation and make it easily visible from our web client.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is one component that is on mainnet: the required voter pass. It is an upgradeable contract and its source code is hosted <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/hvaxlaunch/blob/main/contracts/HVAXVoterCard.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. Relevant addresses are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Voter Pass Proxy Contract: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4E911626Fa378cC95fB1A26Cc272c070eF79e4b7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>0x4E911626Fa378cC95fB1A26Cc272c070eF79e4b7</code></a></li>\n<li>Voter Pass Implementation Contract: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x68fecd506273714b25b0293f26dc40e5fc041c28\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>0x68fECD506273714B25B0293F26dC40E5fc041c28</code></a></li>\n<li>Voter Pass Owner: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xFAD69Bd739c64cC8e3f1C3bb3B60fe4f160174Cc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>0xFAD69Bd739c64cC8e3f1C3bb3B60fe4f160174Cc</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposal requires the development of an Arbitrum-specific <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/franchiser\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">“franchiser”</a> contract which allows the DAO to control the delegated tokens. Event Horizon references an existing Uniswap version that was reportedly audited by Trail of Bits. That audit report has not been published but the results are reportedly available as GitHub issues <a href=\"https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%28TOB\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe recommend that the Franchiser contract be subjected to a security audit before being deployed (as is suggested by the Event Horizon proposal). This could be conducted through either the Arbitrum Foundation or with OpenZeppelin directly as a member of the ARDC. In any case, the audit should be completed and published before any delegations are assigned.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-access-control-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#security-access-control-5\"></a>Security &amp; Access Control</h2>\n<p>The currently deployed <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x4E911626Fa378cC95fB1A26Cc272c070eF79e4b7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Voter Pass contract</a> previously mentioned has a <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xFAD69Bd739c64cC8e3f1C3bb3B60fe4f160174Cc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">single EOA</a> as its owner and is upgradable without a timelock. If the Owner EOA were to be compromised, it could be used to manipulate delegated votes.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe recommend that Event Horizon use an M-of-N multi-sig for any ownership roles in the Voter Pass contract and any other contracts that impact Arbitrum delegations. We also recommend that the Event Horizon team consider implementing a timelock for upgradable contracts and/or make public commitments for how upgrades will be performed in a safe and transparent manner. Regarding the Multi-sig, the Event Horizon team stated their intent to address this recommendation with the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the VoterPass ownership - I think that’s a good recommendation. We will change to a Multi-Sig.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the tokens are to be delegated and not outright transferred, there should be no risk of losing custodial control of the 7M $ARB as long as the Franchiser contract is secure. The worst-case risk aside from Event Horizon’s accounts being compromised, is if Event Horizon acts as a bad-faith delegate and allocates the votes contrary to how they promised.</p>\n<p>In these cases, Event Horizon states that an <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523\">Oversight Committee</a> multi-sig made up of “5 existing, notable delegates” will have ownership control over the Franchiser contract where delegations are received which will enable them to veto votes. However, Event Horizon <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/9\">later stated</a> that this Oversight Committee will only be able to force Event Horizon delegations to abstain from a vote and nothing else.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to note that the Event Horizon team states that the Oversight Committee will only have 24 hours to veto decisions “between the closing of the Event Horizon proposal, and the underlying DAO’s proposal”. It could be challenging for a 3-of-5 multisig to identify a vote that should be vetoed and sign a transaction within this 24 hour period, although the Oversight Committee could still enact a veto anytime prior to the the closing of the Event Horizon proposal if a problem was detected early-on.</p>\n<p>The current setup in the <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/franchiser/blob/f91fff5face262a2306576a9e0b49c257d131f4a/src/Franchiser.sol#L195\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Franchiser contract</a> allows the Owner role to recall delegations, which may be desirable if the Event Horizon system is ever compromised or the voter pools begin acting in bad-faith. When discussing this mechanic with the Event Horizon team, they stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While the proposal doesn’t explicitly state that the DAO can undelegate, we think it’s a useful function to allow the DAO to undelegate through the OC (Oversight Committee) should they wish. The OC would operate through the DAO for this. To clarify: the OC cannot remove delegation per the constraints of the proposal. even though they technically can. a kosher removal of delegation would first have to be approved by the DAO on tally and then can be carried out by the OC</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>\nWe recommend that Arbitrum delegates carefully think through the responsibility and powers of the Oversight Committee to manage the delegations to Event Horizon. We recommend a greater time window than 24 hours for the Oversight Committee to make vetos and that the powers to recall delegations also be retained in the Franchiser contract for emergency scenarios. We encourage a careful selection process for delegates to serve on the Oversight Committee to ensure they can actively monitor and manage the delegations assigned to Event Horizon and respond to potential issues.</p>\n<p>Overall, it’s important to emphasize that the Oversight Committee serves a critical function of managing the ARB delegations to Event Horizon and would be the DAO’s primary responder to any security or governance issues that might arise. All other access control permissions maintained by the Event Horizon team in other contracts should be protected and restricted to minimize their potential impact over the ARB delegations.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-6\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>We’ve provided several important security recommendations here that we encourage the Event Horizon team to implement in their system to enhance the system’s transparency and security stance before deploying any contracts to be used for ARB delegations. We have also highlighted several risks and concerns that Arbitrum delegators should consider in their decisions regarding the Event Horizon proposal as well as the selection for the Oversight Committee. We are happy to engage in further discussion and questions in the forum.</p>\n<p>For more information on OpenZeppelin’s role as Security Member of ARDC, please visit our <a

issue was a lack of coverage.</p>\n<p>The review for this change was a small, short, solo review, instead of what we have come to call a Security Contest, in which tens if not hundreds of professional whitehats all compete to find the most unique bugs.</p>\n<p>Not enough eyes went through this change before it was enacted.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While the Exploit looked very complex from the outside, it

what it was able to produce.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was from these two incidents that I decided to do something about this</p>\n<p>Initially, I wrote my own code generation tool for foundry, which would set

name=\"context-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#context-1\"></a>Context:</h1>\n<p>This proposal picks up from the conversations we had in Denver and 6 weeks of running the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI) Working Group, including weekly workshops, async conversations, and multiple 1-1s with delegates.</p>\n<p>We’ve confirmed existing pain points within the community, formulated an overall vision for the Arbitrum Venture Initiative, developed a high-level strategy for deployment, and started aligning with interested parties.</p>\n<p>We are planning to submit a pilot phase proposal for a Snapshot vote this week based on all the feedback received so far, with a focus on developing a concrete strategy (thesis) for funds deployment and test case with allocators (VCs and other programs) while advancing stakeholder alignment. This will enable the initiative to launch successfully once the appropriate legal setup is ready and avoid delays leading to significant opportunity costs for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We want to make sure to highlight our commitment to integrate the work that we are doing into any larger construct/umbrella that the DAO decides on if this should materialize and not create any conflicting workstreams. As well as to make all the learnings and insights produced available to the DAO or Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p>Further context in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-proposal-non-constitutional-establishment-of-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-avi/23222\">original AVI proposal</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/announcing-the-arbitrum-ventures-initiative-working-group/23012\">AVI workgroup thread</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>Our team’s mission is to enable the Arbitrum DAO to boost the development and financial sustainability by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>defining an effective approach for ArbitrumDAO to setup an Ecosystem Fund that would fund ventures aligned with the ecosystem through venture programs (e.g. VCs, venture builders, accelerators, etc.) and direct investing;</li>\n<li>and then executing on the said approach.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal is focused on a ‘pilot sprint’, where we’ll:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Facilitate an IRL thesis development event and series of online workshops leading up to it, together with experts and the key stakeholders to develop the thesis and strategy in agreed-upon target areas for venture programs;</li>\n<li>In parallel do a market consultation with at least 30 founders and 15 funds, to test how the market sees the opportunity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The learnings and resulting thesis will be documented in a report to equip the delegates and group working on the thesis with the relevant insights.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"why-conduct-a-pilot-sprint-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#why-conduct-a-pilot-sprint-3\"></a>Why conduct a pilot sprint?</h1>\n<p>Operating AVI represents a bold and pioneering initiative for blockchain ecosystems and as such it is also a complex undertaking that involves high capital needs. It also is one of several such in the Arbitrum DAO that require complex stakeholder alignment around setting up legal and governance structures. Thus, it is not appropriate to rush it before the relevant structures have been put in place.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there is a significant opportunity cost in not progressing with good velocity on at least the components that can already clearly be acted on. A lean and pragmatic pilot phase to analyze key themes thoroughly and develop the necessary clarity will provide us with a solid foundation to build on.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"pilot-sprint-approach-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pilot-sprint-approach-4\"></a>Pilot sprint approach</h1>\n<p>The pilot sprint outputs intend to provide the DAO delegates and stakeholders with sufficient information to decide on advancing the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI), or parts of it into the next phase of development, including its operationalisation and funding requirements. The sprint is designed to fund the operational team for 8-weeks long and is the natural progression of our existing Working Group efforts. As well as hosting the IRL thesis development event and online workshops.</p>\n<p>The sprint will kick off in-depth research and workshops to identify opportunity areas (thesis development).</p>\n<p>The pilot sprint will provide concrete data and analysis from various ecosystem participants and stakeholders. Armed with this information, we will have the strategic perspective (thesis development) ready for AVI’s operation.</p>\n<br>\n<h1><a name=\"key-output-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-output-5\"></a>Key Output</h1>\n<p>An in-depth report detailing a shared, well-researched understanding in the Arbitrum community of where the opportunities related to investment lie.</p>\n<br>\nExpected Outcomes\n<ol>\n<li>Equip the DAO delegates and community participants with a deeper shared understanding about a strategy and approach to a coordinated and optimized horizontal strategy for Ecosystem funding and venture development.</li>\n<li>Align the DAO on strategic targets by providing strategic analysis and coordinating key stakeholders and delegates.</li>\n<li>Provide a platform for open discussion as well as active collaboration as we advance towards the next phase of the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI).</li>\n<li>Engage a broad range of builders, capital allocators and talent around new ventures and value creation related to Arbitrum, while embedding their needs and ideas with deep empathy in future design.</li>\n<li>Produce general exposure and community engagement.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\nDeliverables\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>3 market opportunity mapping workshops (online) *A.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1 ‘hackathon’ event where key experts related to the thesis will be invited (1-day event in London / 20-40 ppl). *B</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1 public evening event (on the same day as the hackathon), during which key insights and talks will be presented including a bigger community (80 - 120 ppl). *C</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>30 interviews with builders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>15 interviews with General Partners and other fund managers from various ecosystems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Synthesis Market Consultation Report summarizing key challenges and opportunity areas that the VC funding should address. *D</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<p>A* Examples of thesis exploration ideas that would be discussed during the online workshops and honed down on during the IRL event. DeSci and DePIN are two important current trends. DeSci is interesting from an Arbitrum perspective, among other reasons, because it naturally requires handling a lot of data and transactions on chains. DePIN solutions are relevant in that regard, however as things stand at present it is likely that a lot of these applications might get scattered across different L2s. In that case this would make them computationally inefficient, as they would have to work via the L1. But if a well considered cluster of such applications get attracted to Arbitrum this can create a particularly powerful network effect, making the natural place for such a well defined category. This is an example of a type of scenario that can benefit from being studied in depth to inform a thoughtful ecosystem investment strategy. While this is not necessarily the particular focus being proposed, it illustrates the sort of areas of exploration that might require the attraction of a diverse group of experts. Some of whom might not yet be natively in the Arbitrum ecosystem or in Web3 altogether.**</p>\n<p>B* Location: The Farstar team favors doing the above work in London, because it represents the biggest knowledge economy in the world and is the most diverse city. It is not <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> in anything, but is <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span> to 5 in almost everything, providing an incredibly broad community to pull experts from. And our team has access to a variety of excellent locations that we can make use of. That being said our team is keen to maintain flexibility to run on another location if more accessible for key Arbitrum stakeholders as well as leverage EthCC in the build up to the event.</p>\n<p>C* At the end of the hackathon we would like to make this said central location open for the broader interested community and allow some of the ideas coming from it to spread creating visibility and excitement for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Photo from a recent Web3 unconference our team ran in a venue we might use:<br>\n</p><div class=\"large-image-placeholder\"><a href=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3sWT28U2R9hgG-ZFa-eMaMKV4ADjDLcXXV_xCv6ZXxk3l0N17pSzIUtLbedSeTxtRg_jtBd_-F-N2KjO_8zTS4E3cDi0rYejxcL0e6pZfzF2XeHC2Muy68363_L_bfIr5ko8gS0oxTfebDmNV0sHvXk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"url\">https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3sWT28U2R9hgG-ZFa-eMaMKV4ADjDLcXXV_xCv6ZXxk3l0N17pSzIUtLbedSeTxtRg_jtBd_-F-N2KjO_8zTS4E3cDi0rYejxcL0e6pZfzF2XeHC2Muy68363_L_bfIr5ko8gS0oxTfebDmNV0sHvXk</span><span class=\"help\">(image larger than 4 MB)</span></a></div><p></p>\n<p>D* Here is an example report that was produced by Konstantina recently: <a href=\"https://www.fmfib.bg/media/20240314_Doklad_za_pazaren_test_FIP_i_FTT_clean_EN.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.fmfib.bg/media/20240314_Doklad_za_pazaren_test_FIP_i_FTT_clean_EN.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Our team appreciates that a different format of the deliverable might be more appropriate in the context and will consult delegates and the community to adjust accordingly.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"team-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#team-6\"></a>Team</h2>\n<p>We bring deep expertise in investing (web3 and VC), working with early-stage builders and in ecosystem building (Development VC) around frontier topics and emerging technologies.

Applicant Performance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5.Past experience if any for performing each of the roles and responsibilities described in the appendix (Divide your answer into three sections corresponding to the 3 parts in the appendix).</strong></p>\n<p>The Avantgarde team has relevant previous experience as full time capital allocators to third party fund managers within traditional finance, including building &amp; overseeing institutional grade investment and operational due diligence processes for selecting and monitoring external investment vehicles.</p>\n<p><strong>Cashflow and Accrual Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>The team have previous experience with monitoring cash flows of external mutual fund structures within traditional portfolios, including the monitoring of 9 figure dollar allocations into US Dollar prime and government money market funds for large family offices. This included working with fund managers, fund administrators, and custodians in reconciling fund positions and dividend payments from underlying fund allocations.</p>\n<p>Because of our background with Enzyme and having worked with other DAOs in the space we have accumulated a wealth of experience when it comes to DeFi reporting, cashflow tracking and reporting. We have the ability to automate processes where necessary and can very confidently tackle any on-chain challenges. Some examples of our on-chain work include working with oracles and on-chain NAV calculations, token valuation, reconciliation of accounts (or asset management performance), management &amp; performance fee calculations and automation of processes (eg. reporting for on-chain funds and DAOs).</p>\n<p><strong>Underlying Asset Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>Previously as institutional allocators to third party fund managers within traditional finance, members of the team have over a decade of experience managing segregated accounts of external asset managers for large institutional clients, including day to day monitoring at both the asset class and fund level. Within this experience, members of our team have also built institutional grade quantitative portfolio monitoring tools for breaking down risk exposures from portfolio holdings and returns data across multiple asset classes and fund universes.</p>\n<p>The Avantgarde team also has a strong background in on-chain asset monitoring within DeFi. This includes monitoring of positions within our on-chain funds, monitoring assets for 3rd party protocols for factors which may lead to mispricing (eg., depegs, market depth, etc) and portfolio weights (rebalancing needs).</p>\n<p><strong>Operations and Counterparty Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>The team have experience conducting operational due diligence both with centralised entities, including across fund manager service providers such as administrators, custodians, lawyers, risk management services. We’re also able to identify risk factors to monitor and set up internal processes to track and react.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde have conducted operational due diligence on smart contracts as part of integration work for Enzyme, an on-chain asset management protocol that has been running since 2018 without being exposed to any significant exploits. Operational work on Enzyme integrations includes rigorous testing, including on fund flows and redemptions from vaults, and encompasses working with external smart contract auditors. Additionally, we have conducted operational due diligence and monitoring within the Ethereum node operator space, including service level agreements around slashing and forgone staking rewards for example.</p>\n<p>On the interaction of smart contracts, legal fund structures, and fund management service providers, Avantgarde has a unique perspective in operating fund vehicles run on blockchain rails and the nuances in integrating smart contracts with legal contracts across the fund management stack.</p>\n<p><strong>6.Describe any conflicts of interest your entity, its investors or key personnel may have with any potential service providers selected under the program</strong></p>\n<p>We have a broad client base with both TradFi and DeFi players. We currently don’t see any conflicts of interest but we are happy to disclose any that may come up publicly as and when they do.</p>\n<p>It is also worth highlighting the importance of an independent risk and monitoring function, which is often separate from investment teams who select allocations. Since Avantgarde was not part of the screening committee for the service providers, we feel we are in a good position to act in an unbiased way in monitoring the providers selected, and can provide an additional independent level of oversight beyond the opinions provided at the screening stage.</p>\n<p><strong>7.Under what situations would you make a recommendation for Arbitrum to withdraw its assets from a selected service provider to fulfil each aspect of the outlined scope in the appendix?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a wide variety of reasons for redeeming from a provider, and whilst significant material issues are often evident in net performance figures, in our experience more subtle issues from a risk perspective often require a mosaic of quantitative and qualitative factors to pick up before the fact. In our view, this is also likely to be the case in monitoring for the STEP program - whilst we have no visibility into the final service providers which will be selected, within the money market fund fund categories (which is where the underlying strategies of many of the applicants belong) there is little performance dispersion because of the tight constraints of money market fund regulation on eligible securities, weighted average life, weighted average maturity, and liquidity.</p>\n<p>As program manager we would look to develop a holistic forward looking view based on other factors that could impact the repeatability of past performance, including: deviations in portfolio exposures, turnover in key personnel, irregularities at the smart contract level, data inconsistencies between centralised sources, relevant changes for the provider at the firm &amp; regulatory levels, amongst others. A key point is that no single indicator is a silver bullet, and we believe a significant part of effective monitoring is in being able to identify the causes for material changes - crucially, effective monitoring requires the ability to differentiate between 1) the inherent noise that is present in all aspects of external portfolio surveillance, and 2) genuine signals that arise when incremental uncertainty becomes significant enough to warrant action.</p>\n<p>There may also be other exogenous factors to consider for withdrawing from a project, such as diversification considerations at the overall level or where a project’s alignment with the Arbitrum ecosystem evolves in a way that is not consistent with the longer term goals of the STEP program.</p>\n<p><strong>8.Please list any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organisational structures</strong></p>\n<p>Avantgarde has worked with leading protocols including Uniswap, Apecoin, The Graph, Arbitrum, Nexus Mutual, Paraswap, Enzyme and others. DAOs leverage Avantgarde’s combined expertise in protocol development and asset management for developing strategies to improve treasury sustainability. Avantgarde has been involved with Arbitrum’s Treasury &amp; Sustainability Working Group since the early stages, including the production of a study focusing on how traditional asset classes, accessed via real world assets, can reduce risk within DAO treasuries which played a role in the evolution of the STEP program to where it is today - <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-research-risk-reduction-in-dao-treasuries/20662/2\">link</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>9.What is the value of assets monitored by your entity?</strong></p>\n<p>Provided by email</p>\n<p><strong>10.Can you explain how risk management (investment and operational) is being done for assets under monitoring?</strong></p>\n<p>Avantgarde currently performs risk management from a number of perspectives. On it’s asset management strategies, the investment thesis for each holding is reassessed on a continuous basis to ensure the quantitative and qualitative factors for inclusion have not materially changed. This includes monitoring flags on key on-chain and off-chain risk metrics. A few of the metrics which are deemed time critical have pre-trade approval when they hit certain thresholds, enabling action to be taken on the position when triggered. Other metrics flag major changes that require further investigation, in conjunction with other data analysis or by speaking to related project teams. The team will also monitor related social channels such as twitter and discord for related announcements and changes to protocols. Where applicable, periodic reviews with underlying project teams are performed, including refreshing qualitative or proprietary information that is not available on-chain to ensure documentation is up to date.</p>\n<p><strong>11.Describe the content, format and preparation process of performance reports. This should include details of interest earned and status of total assets. Provide a sample if available.</strong></p>\n<p>Reports should be tailored based on the portfolio/product. The content of the report will be dependent on the specific product. Typical performance reports for money market related products will include: yield over multiple horizons (1 day, 7 days, 30 days), fund and firm level assets under management, portfolio breakdown by major asset types (such as overnight repo and treasury bills), breakdown by maturity buckets, weighted average life, weighted average maturity, daily and weekly maturing assets as % of the fund, and token prices by major price sources. The reports and corresponding updates to the Arbitrum governance forums should also be customised to include requested information from the foundation and DAO community, such as total interest earned.</p>\n<p><strong>IV.

There’s approximately 3 million ARB of funding available, which will be distributed across 5-10 programs. We encouraged applicants to consider scalability in their proposals, focusing on achieving a “one dollar in, two dollars out” impact. Applications closed at the end of April, and decisions will be made by a decentralized group of reviewers in mid-May. We have finalized the rubrics for both.

The protocol’s liquidity is driven by a hybrid model that combines a unified central limit order book with an integrated automated market maker. This liquidity is further enhanced by pairwise market making vaults powered by <a href=\"https://www.elixir.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Elixir</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overview-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overview-4\"></a>Overview</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"vertex-liquidity-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-liquidity-5\"></a>Vertex Liquidity</h3>\n<p><strong>Orderbook:</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex’s orderbook, called <a href=\"https://edge.vertexprotocol.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Edge</a>, operates as an off-chain node layered on top of the smart contracts and contained within the Arbitrum protocol layer.  Edge creates a central hub of liquidity which can be consumed by instances on different chains concurrently.  As a result, Edge is capable of matching inbound orders from one chain with the combined orderbook liquidity of all of the base layers plugged into the Vertex sequencer.</p>\n<p>Both sides of the trade are filled out, and the sequencer (Edge) takes the opposite side of the inbound trades — automatically hedging and rebalancing liquidity on the back-end between chains.</p>\n<p>Notably, the sequencer only mirrors resting liquidity (e.g., maker orders) across the sharded states of the Vertex Edge instances on different base layers. Taker orders remain unchanged, and are submitted directly from an independent Vertex Edge instance, such as Vertex Arbitrum, to the sequencer’s unified liquidity layer.</p>\n<p>Vertex charges a flat fee for interactions with the Vertex Sequencer, denominated in USDC, to compensate for the gas paid to the underlying blockchain while allowing for a faster trading experience via lightning-fast order matching.</p>\n<p>Edge is significant because it eliminates user costs for placing market orders that consume liquidity during the STIP program’s duration. Fees for withdrawal, liquidation, and minting/burning of LP tokens will still apply. Being off-chain, Edge also constitutes an external dependency for both the Vertex smart contracts and the Arbitrum ecosystem. Should Edge experience downtime, Vertex will rely solely on the AMM for spot liquidity, and the perpetual market liquidity will cease.</p>\n<p><strong>AMM:</strong></p>\n<p>The pooled liquidity of the AMM is integrated with the bids and asks on the Vertex spot order book. This AMM liquidity is combined with liquidity from automated traders facilitated by the sequencer, creating a unified source of liquidity against which users can trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex Universal Cross Margin</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex user’s margin is shared across all spot, perpetual and money market positions.  The improved capital efficiency of this differentiates Vertex from other single product exchanges.</p>\n<p>This is apparent in the ease that arbitrageurs can monetize Vertex funding rates completely within the protocol, accessing leverage from the money market and offsetting positions from the spot DEX.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex External Interactions</strong></p>\n<p>The Vertex Protocol is mostly self-contained, being primarily focused on perpetual futures trading.  The two major external touch points are with the <a href=\"https://www.elixir.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Elixir Network</a> as the liquidity strategies powering Vertex liquidity vaults, and <a href=\"https://docs.vertexprotocol.com/getting-started/vertex-edge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vertex Edge</a> as the cross-chain liquidity engine running as an off-chain component.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"use-of-incentives-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#use-of-incentives-6\"></a>Use of Incentives</h1>\n<p>Vertex deployed all ARB incentives to boost trading volumes across its spot and perpetual markets. As the platform primarily concentrates on trading activity, it is reasonable that the perpetual markets will attract the bulk of this activity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"trading-rewards-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trading-rewards-7\"></a><strong>Trading Rewards</strong>:</h2>\n<p>Rewards on trading fees are capped at up to 75% of the taker fee paid. However, this percentage may be lower if the fees paid exceed 133% of the dollar amount of allocated weekly incentives (approximately $200k initially). In such cases, incentives are distributed proportionally to the fees paid. Conversely, if the fees paid are less than 133% of the dollar amount of allocated weekly incentives, then the full allocated amount is not utilized. The unused portion is then carried over to the following week.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"incentivize-community-based-market-making-elixir-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentivize-community-based-market-making-elixir-8\"></a><strong>Incentivize Community-Based Market-Making (Elixir)</strong>:</h2>\n<p>Vertex launched Elixir’s Fusion Pools on its platform at the beginning of the STIP, setting a baseline annual percentage rate (APR) from ARB incentives at 15%. If the total value locked (TVL) in these pools does not reach the maximum capacity at any time, the remaining incentives will be carried over to the following week.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"other-uses-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#other-uses-9\"></a><strong>Other Uses</strong></h2>\n<p>Vertex also removed sequencer fees for takers interacting with Vertex Edge for the duration of the program.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"pace-of-spending-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pace-of-spending-10\"></a><strong>Pace of Spending</strong></h2>\n<p>In early January, the Arbitrum DAO voted to extend the deadline for spending incentives from January 31 to February 29.

This detailed, bottom-up analysis scrutinizes individual components of the STIP, which are unique to Vertex.  This allows a clear prescription of how this results of the program were obtained and how this could be applied to other protocols.</p>\n<p>Despite the STIP program’s short-term nature, this report assesses its prolonged benefits by analyzing protocol usage data following the program’s conclusion.  The intention is to identify persistent activity changes, and what drove them.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of Vertex’s incentives is thoroughly examined across various dimensions, initiating with a comprehensive analysis of trader reactions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Were the incentives appealing to new traders?</li>\n<li>How effectively were traders retained?</li>\n<li>What impact did the incentives have on traders’ average trading volumes, and how does this vary across different trader categories?</li>\n<li>How these individual trader changes drove overall trading volumes?</li>\n<li>How were traders’ demands for exposure affected?</li>\n<li>What was the effect on overall TVL, segmented by token category?</li>\n<li>How did this activity influence other Arbitrum uses, such as blockspace demand?</li>\n<li>Did this stimulate additional trading activity on Arbitrum, or did it cannibalize existing activity?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, the impact of liquidity incentives intended to bootstrap Fusion pools is evaluated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How swiftly did liquidity reach the pools’ cap?</li>\n<li>Was this liquidity sticky after the incentives ended?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The distribution of the incentives is also analyzed to gain insight into the structural efficiency of this program.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"trader-reactions-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trader-reactions-12\"></a>Trader Reactions</h2>\n<p>Throughout this section a trader is defined as a unique subaccount on Vertex.  This will likely differ from the number of human traders, but serves as a useful proxy.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"new-trader-acquisition-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-trader-acquisition-13\"></a><strong>New Trader Acquisition</strong></h3>\n<p>Throughout the STIP, 5,764 new traders executed at least one taker order on Vertex, only marginally more than the 5,208 new traders in the prior four months. At first glance, it appears that the Vertex STIP’s fee rebate structure did not greatly influence new trader acquisition. However, several other factors must be considered.</p>\n<p>The period before the STIP likely saw sybil activity aiming to benefit from the VRTX TGE in November 2023. This probably inflated the count of actual human traders far more than during the STIP when sybil activity had no advantage.</p>\n<p>The incentives from competing trading platforms also play a crucial role. Two other exchanges received significantly larger STIP grants than Vertex, potentially making trader acquisition harder during this time.</p>\n<p>The rise in new traders after the program ended suggests that acquiring new traders did not decelerate post-program.</p>\n<p>We conclude that Vertex’s fee rebates moderately impacted trader acquisition. Due to the challenges in accounting for competing protocol incentives and prior airdrop farming, the exact impact remains uncertain and warrants further investigation, considering the competitive ecosystem.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d0a876361a311dec7fb01bb320a2c4c9c615cf27.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/tLSeYo3r2CjDme1ec6vbiLGPfMz.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Vertex Monthly Active Traders\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d0a876361a311dec7fb01bb320a2c4c9c615cf27_2_684x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Vertex Monthly Active Traders\" data-base62-sha1=\"tLSeYo3r2CjDme1ec6vbiLGPfMz\" width=\"684\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d0a876361a311dec7fb01bb320a2c4c9c615cf27_2_684x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d0a876361a311dec7fb01bb320a2c4c9c615cf27_2_1026x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d0a876361a311dec7fb01bb320a2c4c9c615cf27_2_1368x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1E272A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"trader-retention-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#trader-retention-14\"></a>Trader Retention</h3>\n<p>The monthly retention rate at Vertex is defined as the percentage of traders who engaged in at least one trade in the previous month and continued to trade in the current month.</p>\n<p>Vertex has experienced a steady improvement in its monthly retention rate throughout its operational history, contributing to signs of compounding user growth over time.</p>\n<p>The noticeable decline in December is primarily attributed to the large number of new traders joining Vertex during the initial month of the STIP, and is regarded as a temporary anomaly. Subsequently, the monthly retention rate has resumed its upward trend.</p>\n<p>Our analysis concludes that traders involved in Vertex during the STIP have shown reasonable retention levels.

The median trader gradually increased their trade size over the duration of the STIP, followed by a significant reduction, with early signs of recovery in April. This segment shows limited elasticity to incentives, with no noticeable increase at the program’s outset or sustained drop at its conclusion.</p>\n<p>The 75th percentile trader saw rapid increases in trading volume until the incentives were reduced in January. This segment appears most responsive to fee rebates, with trading volumes reverting to initial levels immediately after the STIP concluded, and no significant increase in April.</p>\n<p>Small to mid-sized trading firms showed trends similar to the power retail segment but were less sensitive to changes in incentives. Their trading volumes did not decline immediately after the incentive reduction in January. Post-program, their volumes decreased but remained significantly above pre-program levels.</p>\n<p>The highest volume traders consistently increased their trading volumes during the first three months of the STIP, then decreased in February. Their volumes have since rebounded, suggesting that the STIP had a highly positive impact on their activity. The rebate incentives appear to be effectively targeted at these traders, facilitating the expansion of their operations and integration of their infrastructure.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e6068adfcab3a9f7b401585b7acf76d371d4be5b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wOTPNgjrfQznrUQ4PeZUGS7siw3.png?dl=1\" title=\"Median Monthly Volume\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e6068adfcab3a9f7b401585b7acf76d371d4be5b.png\" alt=\"Median Monthly Volume\" data-base62-sha1=\"wOTPNgjrfQznrUQ4PeZUGS7siw3\" width=\"690\" height=\"493\" data-dominant-color=\"191E22\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/42c254f8db0096b896d2949737d0659e105aa33e.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/9wzRLNoy56xX9eGq5MpNbuxdJdY.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"75th Percentile Monthly Volume\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/42c254f8db0096b896d2949737d0659e105aa33e_2_690x406.jpeg\" alt=\"75th Percentile Monthly Volume\" data-base62-sha1=\"9wzRLNoy56xX9eGq5MpNbuxdJdY\" width=\"690\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/42c254f8db0096b896d2949737d0659e105aa33e_2_690x406.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/42c254f8db0096b896d2949737d0659e105aa33e.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/42c254f8db0096b896d2949737d0659e105aa33e.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1A1F22\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/07882ab38bf09bf8247aa20de5783c871b6be3c4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/14D4R49XXwpqYYrNfOdbbGluwg4.png?dl=1\" title=\"95th Percentile Monthly Volume\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/07882ab38bf09bf8247aa20de5783c871b6be3c4.png\" alt=\"95th Percentile Monthly Volume\" data-base62-sha1=\"14D4R49XXwpqYYrNfOdbbGluwg4\" width=\"690\" height=\"450\" data-dominant-color=\"1A1E22\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/abf4fb97a50d3e9737f551b9c7ef8f9219ddc480.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/oxcwhkBptxg3KIIynUzZMWg61mo.png?dl=1\" title=\"99th Percentile Monthly Volume\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/abf4fb97a50d3e9737f551b9c7ef8f9219ddc480.png\" alt=\"99th Percentile Monthly Volume\" data-base62-sha1=\"oxcwhkBptxg3KIIynUzZMWg61mo\" width=\"690\" height=\"450\" data-dominant-color=\"1A1F22\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"overall-activity-growth-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overall-activity-growth-16\"></a>Overall Activity Growth</h3>\n<p>Weekly trading volumes on Vertex result from the combination of the number of traders and their average activity.

Only 30% of Vertex trading margin is held in stablecoins meaning variance in token prices will affect this metric.  Before the STIP most trading margin TVL comprised of USDC, however this began changing almost immediately after the STIP launched.</p>\n<p>Estimating this impact over the period of the STIP, the change in trading margin TVL is broken down into the change due to price changes and the change due to net new TVL $\\Delta TVL = \\Delta TVL_{price} + \\Delta TVL_{new}$.  Here the change in TVL due to price changes is defined as $\\Delta TVL_{price} = \\sum{TVL^i_0 \\times (P^i_T - P^i_0)}$, and the change in TVL  due to incremental activity as $\\Delta TVL_{new} = \\sum{P^i_T \\times (TVL^i_T - TVL_0^i)}$.</p>\n<p>$P^i_0$ represents the price at time 0 of token i, and similarly</p>\n<p>$TVL^i_T$ represents the TVL at time T of token i</p>\n<p>Time 0 corresponds with the beginning of the STIP program and T with the end.</p>\n<p>The results show that despite the price increases over the program, the vast majority of the increase in TVL can be attributed to net new flows into the clearinghouse.

While TVL across Arbitrum increased by approximately $250 million, Vertex contributed about 20% to this growth. Notably, Vertex’s TVL expanded ten times faster than the average for other Arbitrum exchanges in percentage terms. Given the consistent direction of growth and its modest share of the total increase, it is evident that Vertex’s growth is predominantly organic and represents new TVL.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Vertex’s TVL performance is impressive relative to the broader ecosystem. Despite a general decrease in interest for leveraged trading and the end of incentives, Vertex’s TVL has remained near its highs, whereas the industry generally has fallen by 20%. This resilience suggests that Vertex’s focus on incentivizing organic activity through rebates is creating sustainable outcomes.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e0f1b2ee6a9e52a8403c62bbdc26d6afe96107cf.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/w5WN2zWmPV4tp9wsq4UGmeIWewD.png?dl=1\" title=\"Vertex's TVL performance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e0f1b2ee6a9e52a8403c62bbdc26d6afe96107cf_2_690x118.png\" alt=\"Vertex's TVL performance\" data-base62-sha1=\"w5WN2zWmPV4tp9wsq4UGmeIWewD\" width=\"690\" height=\"118\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e0f1b2ee6a9e52a8403c62bbdc26d6afe96107cf_2_690x118.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e0f1b2ee6a9e52a8403c62bbdc26d6afe96107cf_2_1035x177.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e0f1b2ee6a9e52a8403c62bbdc26d6afe96107cf_2_1380x236.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"202428\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/61ca0847bba2eee0c81a25db9facac029ab0ae6a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/dX5alHoKkTO9mft2RLrdfhNeF8m.png?dl=1\" title=\"Arbitrum Perpetual Futures TVL\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/61ca0847bba2eee0c81a25db9facac029ab0ae6a_2_664x500.png\" alt=\"Arbitrum Perpetual Futures TVL\" data-base62-sha1=\"dX5alHoKkTO9mft2RLrdfhNeF8m\" width=\"664\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/61ca0847bba2eee0c81a25db9facac029ab0ae6a_2_664x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/61ca0847bba2eee0c81a25db9facac029ab0ae6a_2_996x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/61ca0847bba2eee0c81a25db9facac029ab0ae6a.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1B1F22\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"vertex-liquidity-reaction-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-liquidity-reaction-20\"></a>Vertex Liquidity Reaction</h2>\n<p>The initial $3m cap for Vertex Fusion Vaults powered by Elixir was hit on the first day.

While it is common for trading volumes on venues to be highly concentrated among the most active traders, this level of concentration is unusually high.</p>\n<p>To obtain an objective metric for the concentration of incentives distributed, we use the Herfindahl-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hirschman Index (HHI)</a>.  The HHI is a common measure of market concentration, typically applied to firms in an industry.  It applies well to the distribution of incentives as Vertex can be seen as a marketplace with individual traders transaction on it.  The resulting index is generally interpreted as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An HHI of less than 1,500 is considered a competitive marketplace</li>\n<li>An HHI of 1,500 to 2,500 is moderately concentrated</li>\n<li>An HHI of 2,500 or greater is highly concentrated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for the Vertex incentives stands at 1475, which is considered competitive. Beyond the two largest claimants, there exists a long, substantial tail of rewards recipients, suggesting a healthy and well-distributed rewards program. Excluding the two largest claimants, the HHI falls to 334, indicating an extremely competitive environment.</p>\n<p>However, the efficiency of Vertex’s incentive distribution could have been improved if the two largest claimants had not received over half of the rewards. This concentration may have diluted the overall benefits of the program.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1a5e5662a24ea6770fa30fee77ef7094d4010af0.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3LgwWcyiPRg6fflLDnUUioCOVA4.png?dl=1\" title=\"Vertex Share of Arbitrum Gas\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a5e5662a24ea6770fa30fee77ef7094d4010af0_2_690x442.png\" alt=\"Vertex Share of Arbitrum Gas\" data-base62-sha1=\"3LgwWcyiPRg6fflLDnUUioCOVA4\" width=\"690\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a5e5662a24ea6770fa30fee77ef7094d4010af0_2_690x442.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a5e5662a24ea6770fa30fee77ef7094d4010af0_2_1035x663.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a5e5662a24ea6770fa30fee77ef7094d4010af0_2_1380x884.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"2E282E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"incentive-risk-analysis-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentive-risk-analysis-22\"></a>Incentive Risk Analysis</h1>\n<p>The incentive risk analysis uses the above deep bottom-up analysis of the Vertex Protocol informing the specific potential manifestations of these risks in a protocol specific context.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex Risk Factors Under Investigation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vertex incentives create excessive speculation:</strong> This could destabilize aspects of the protocol, cause excessive user losses, or potentially affect ecosystem partners.</li>\n<li><strong>Vertex incentives skew the natural growth of trading activity and liquidity:</strong> This could cause risks such as bad debts from liquidation slippage, poor user experience, or markets depegging from their underlying index prices.</li>\n<li><strong>Vertex incentives distort the growth of Arbitrum perpetual trading:</strong> Vertex growth could come at the expense of competing DEXs, rather than onboarding net new activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Vertex incentives do not grow liquidity over the long term:</strong> Liquidity leaves once STIP incentives end.</li>\n<li><strong>Incentives do not lead to sustained trading activity:</strong> Trading activity leaves once STIP incentives end.</li>\n<li><strong>Incentives counteract the wind down of bridged USDC.e on Arbitrum:</strong> Futures collateral on Vertex is USDC.e meaning growth in TVL would increase the demand for USDC.e on Arbitrum.</li>\n<li><strong>Vertex incentives cause protocol infrastructure malfunction:</strong> The increase in activity could cause external elements such as the Vertex Edge liquidity connection, or the Elixir liquidity connection to fail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these risks are individually covered in detail below.</p>\n<p><strong>Vertex incentives create excessive speculation</strong></p>\n<p>To evaluate the risk of excessive speculation, we use the volume of weekly liquidations as an indicator.

Vertex has handled the extra load of incentivized trading without issue.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-takeaways-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-takeaways-23\"></a>Key Takeaways</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"vertex-incentive-positives-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-incentive-positives-24\"></a>Vertex Incentive Positives</h2>\n<p><strong>Using Incentives to Amplify New Protocol Upgrades and Announcements</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex launched its Elixir market making vaults at the same time the program commenced creating additional hype.  Three weeks after launch its native token VRTX launched drawing further attention to the protocol and its incentive program.</p>\n<p>Linking the STIP incentives to bootstrapping the both liquidity in the Elixir vaults, and trading activity played an important role in the sustained yields in these vaults over the long term as activity growth provided a native yield source for the liquidity.</p>\n<p>Together these appear to have played a key role in making the program discoverable, and drawing in users in a competitive space.</p>\n<p><strong>Keeping the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex incentives were extremely easy to understand, and optimize for.  Traders would receive up to 75% of their trading fees back, and LPs would earn 15% APY on their capital.  This told traders exactly what they needed to do to earn rewards, and set clear expectations around the degree of incentivization.</p>\n<p><strong>Focusing on the Demand Side of the Market</strong></p>\n<p>Vertex incentives were heavily weighted towards incentivizing trading activity with 85% of incentives going to trading fee rebates.  This brought fee-paying activity which then transitioned into a sustainable yield source for liquidity providers.</p>\n<p>Getting the balance between supply and demand right is a complex challenge and in hindsight Vertex has managed this extremely well.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigating Wash Trading by Ensuring Users Incur a Small Cost</strong></p>\n<p>Maintaining a positive cost to trade is essential in avoiding wash trading and mercenary rewards farming.  Vertex STIP rewards were intentionally designed to only rebate 75% of taker fees, making it unprofitable to trade solely to farm rewards.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"vertex-incentive-potential-improvements-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-incentive-potential-improvements-25\"></a>Vertex Incentive Potential Improvements</h2>\n<p><strong>Less Concentration Amongst Two Large Accounts</strong></p>\n<p>Healthy trading venues thrive on diverse trading activity, which enables liquidity providers to offset risk and ensures the market functions optimally. However, a high concentration of rewards, with 53% allocated to just two accounts, diminishes the distribution of rewards to other participants, potentially undermining the intended effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Power-Retail Traders Did Not Sustain their Activity</strong></p>\n<p>Power-retail traders which we identify as the 75th percentile highest monthly volume trades, dropped in average monthly volume to their original level.  An allocation of incentives specifically targeted at this segment such as trading competitions could have retained their engagement better.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"vertex-stip-useful-resources-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vertex-stip-useful-resources-26\"></a>Vertex STIP Useful Resources</h1>\n<p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-final-stip-round-1/17435\">STIP Application</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Pv5X_zbn-wXUk8-SFnTxZOJrvg9PNvKRge69CZUbv4/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Slide Presentation</a></p>\n<p><strong>Bi-weekly updates:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-stip-program-update/19608\">Update 1</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-stip-program-update-nov-30-2023/19838\">Update 2</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-bi-weekly-update-december-15-2023/20081\">Update 3</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-bi-weekly-update-december-29-2023/20320\">Update 4</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-jan-12-2024/20600\">Update 5</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-jan-26-2024/20879\">Update 6</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-feb-9-2024/21171\">Update 7</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-feb-23-2024/21431\">Update 8</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-march-8-2024/22335\">Update 9</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/vertex-protocol-bi-weekly-update-march-22-2024/22813\">Update 10</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"disclaimer-27\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#disclaimer-27\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>The reports, and other information and materials (“<strong>Materials</strong>”) made available by Chaos Labs, Inc.

Misconduct by Synapse</a></h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum Research &amp; Development Committee (ARDC) has raised concerns about Synapse’s use of ARB incentives from STIP Round 2. After receiving 2M ARB, 750K ARB was transferred to three wallets, which still hold the ARB and have delegated it to a Synapse co-founder. These actions may violate STIP rules requiring unused ARB to be returned to the DAO and prohibiting its use in governance. An explanation from Synapse is requested.</p>\n<p>You can read the full forum post <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/concerns-regarding-possible-misconduct-by-synapse-with-respect-to-the-usage-of-arb-incentives-allocated-through-the-stip/23775\">here.</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"delegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changeshttpsforumarbitrumfoundationtdelegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changes23784-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#delegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changeshttpsforumarbitrumfoundationtdelegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changes23784-9\"></a><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegates-incentive-program-upcoming-changes/23784\">Delegates Incentive Program Upcoming Changes</a></h3>\n<p>The Delegates Incentive Program has reached its second month, and some areas for improvement have been identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stop Comments on Technical Proposals</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Update Participation Rate</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Lower Token Threshold</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A public call will be held on Friday, May 17th at 12:00 UTC to discuss these changes.

To do this we are both researching how other ecosystems are tackling this(if they are), what social media outlets we currently have as an ecosystem and how can we create a strategy that actually helps Arbitrum DAO!</p>\n<p>My goal as the Gandalf is to enable a collaborative medium in which all the contributors can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>co-work on identifying the current social media needs</li>\n<li>co-design a strategy that we can use to fill in any communications gaps and hopefully increase the reach of the current outlets the Arbitrum ecosystem and the DAO has.</li>\n<li>Decentralize decision making over time</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The final goals is to create a comprehensive, step by step strategy in which we can create, grow and expand the reach of Arbitrum DAOs social media outlets in a measurable, reviewable and value adding way.</p>\n<p>Some possible outcomes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a strategy that “makes” sense for the current phase of the DAO</li>\n<li>Expand Arbitrums reach on new “native web3” socials: Lens, Farcaster, Linkedin, etc and on web2 socials: Instagram, Facebook, etc. There are numerous Arbitrum language specific groups on web2 socials that have a LOT of members.</li>\n<li>Allow the DAO and community members to step in and contribute</li>\n<li>Creating a decentralized bounty board in which community members can propose valuable ideas and also work on them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What would medium-long term success look like:</p>\n<ol start=\"0\">\n<li>Allow the DAO to submit requests to the group and overtime decentralize the \"management’ or at least “content” creation</li>\n<li>Enable anyone to launch a local chapter for Arbitrum DAO and be able to clearly measure their success by creating a funding round using QF. This way we can enable the best social media managers, content creators to step in. The Arbitrum community will decide who are the best ones and how much they should be funded!</li>\n<li>Exponentially increase the reach of Arbitrum DAOs social media presence, education and digital events</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are scheduled to meet at least 5 times over the course of 2 months to propose formal objectives for the group. At the end of the 2 months, we are expected to draft a proposal or disband the group.

Most relevant to the STEP program, Steakhouse pioneered MakerDAO’s RWA program (which now totals over $2.5bn in asset value) and is responsible for monitoring and tracking the performance and cashflows of those assets.</p>\n<p>Each month, Steakhouse provides a high level monthly report on Maker’s RWA portfolio, the most recent of which can be found <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-asset-report-2024-03/24159\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to this summary report, Steakhouse performs in-depth reporting and analysis on each RWA deal, creating publicly available dashboards with complete cashflows wherever possible. Please reference the below examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HJDfe9hLA0_vTmdtyIqBoaHik68Imp6a-LzMtVDnH0/edit#gid=517022340\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Huntingdon Valley Bank</a> - A partnership with a Pennsylvania community bank to finance commercial and consumer loans, facilitated by a Delaware statutory trust.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/steakhouse/makerdao-clydesdale\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Clydesdale Dune Dashboard</a> - A transaction designated for the purchase of 0-6 month treasury bills, arranged by Monetalis and facilitated by a British Virgin Islands SPV.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Steakhouse creates a monthly economic report for the overall protocol, tracking the balance sheet, income, and other key metrics. The latest protocol economics report can be found <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/protocol-economics-report-2024-03/24229\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Underlying Asset Monitoring</em></p>\n<p>Similar to the cashflow and economics reporting mentioned above, Steakhouse also conducts monthly covenant and portfolio reviews to ensure that the RWA transactions in question are meeting the necessary portfolio concentrations and collateral quality requirements.</p>\n<p>Each deal requires a synthesis of off-chain and on-chain data and an active working relationship with the RWA issuer. For examples of this covenant monitoring, please see the monthly RWA report for MakerDAO, linked again for convenience <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-asset-report-2024-03/24159\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.

In New Silver’s case, the underlying portfolio is confidential, but summary characteristics are provided in the monthly report to show compliance with the stated covenants.</p>\n<p><em>Operations and Counterparty Monitoring</em></p>\n<p>Steakhouse has performed a series of in-depth reviews of RWA issuers and service providers. Some of these reviews have been performed in conjunction with MakerDAO transactions and some as public goods.</p>\n<p>Please see the below examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-002-new-silver-restructuring-risk-and-legal-assessment/21417\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">New Silver Restructuring Risk and Legal Assessment</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JZG6sPetgbKoT-9ETeqb692n7lcXLYUI/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Overview of Blackrock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RP8MU45vx86hZpjdVO6MxVmmDdaHrxhV/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mountain Protocol (USDM) Economic and Legal Review</a></p>\n<p>In each case, Steakhouse performed thorough due-diligence to understand each point in the operational chain of the product and identify key risks and points of failure. Steakhouse continues to advise multiple real-world asset issuers on a daily basis, which further broadens Steakhouse’s expertise and exposure in the space.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"describe-any-conflicts-of-interest-your-entity-its-investors-or-key-personnel-may-have-with-any-potential-service-providers-selected-under-the-program-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#describe-any-conflicts-of-interest-your-entity-its-investors-or-key-personnel-may-have-with-any-potential-service-providers-selected-under-the-program-19\"></a>Describe any conflicts of interest your entity, its investors or key personnel may have with any potential service providers selected under the program</h4>\n<p>Steakhouse has a diverse client base and strong relationships in the RWA and DeFi space. As a result, there is some overlap between the STEP applicants and organizations with which we have an active engagement or economic interest. If selected as manager, Steakhouse is happy to publicly disclose any potential conflicts of interest in this regard.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"under-what-situations-would-you-make-a-recommendation-for-arbitrum-to-withdraw-its-assets-from-a-selected-service-provider-to-fulfill-each-aspect-of-the-outlined-scope-in-the-appendix-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#under-what-situations-would-you-make-a-recommendation-for-arbitrum-to-withdraw-its-assets-from-a-selected-service-provider-to-fulfill-each-aspect-of-the-outlined-scope-in-the-appendix-20\"></a>Under what situations would you make a recommendation for Arbitrum to withdraw its assets from a selected service provider to fulfill each aspect of the outlined scope in the appendix?</h4>\n<p>The scope specifically calls for assets that are stable, liquid, and provide a yield uncorrelated with crypto markets that is at least commensurate with US Treasuries. With this framework in mind, Steakhouse would monitor the following essential investment characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Capital Preservation: Minimizing credit risk to safeguard investment principal.</li>\n<li>Legal Risk: Assessing risks related to bankruptcy and regulatory changes to avoid legal entanglements.</li>\n<li>Liquidity and Salability: Ensuring that assets can be readily converted into cash without a significant loss in value.</li>\n<li>Yield and Relative Value: Striving for returns that are competitive with similar risk investments, particularly when benchmarked against U.S. Treasuries.</li>\n<li>Operational Processes: Valuing transparency and resilience in operational practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steakhouse proposes that a material and adverse change in any of these categories—should such changes prove irreparable in a timely manner—constitutes sufficient grounds to recommend the withdrawal or reduction of the investment allocation. Ultimately, many of these factors are subjective and require a deep understanding of traditional markets, institutional processes, and the broader crypto markets. Steakhouse is uniquely equipped to undertake this analysis, backed by our team’s extensive and diverse experience in these areas.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"please-list-any-experience-your-firm-has-in-working-with-decentralized-organizational-structures-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#please-list-any-experience-your-firm-has-in-working-with-decentralized-organizational-structures-21\"></a>Please list any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organizational structures</h4>\n<p>Please see the “past experience\" section above.

Similar to existing institutional processes, Steakhouse typically performs reviews annually, monthly, or more frequently as necessary, to assess changes to the asset characteristics or operational processes of each investment. A typical review cycle would be as follows:</p>\n<p><em>Daily</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor broad market events and changes, as well as disruptions to liquidity or general systemic function</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Monthly</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct a thorough review of underlying portfolio assets to assess market trends, price movements, and changes in credit risks.</li>\n<li>Certify covenant compliance to ensure all investment conditions are met, safeguarding against contractual breaches.</li>\n<li>Assess performance relative to any key benchmarks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Annually (or more frequently as necessary)</em></p>\n<p>Perform standard due diligence on each issuer through detailed questionnaires and direct calls to assess key changes, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ownership and organizational structure changes</li>\n<li>Shifts in executive or senior management</li>\n<li>Updates in accounting, technology, and custodial or other service providers</li>\n<li>Status of permits and licensing</li>\n<li>Material litigation or legal proceedings</li>\n<li>Any regulatory enforcement actions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These comprehensive checks and reviews are designed to capture a holistic view of each asset, ensuring all potential risks are managed proactively.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"describe-the-content-format-and-preparation-process-of-performance-reports-this-should-include-details-of-interest-earned-and-status-of-total-assets-provide-a-sample-if-available-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#describe-the-content-format-and-preparation-process-of-performance-reports-this-should-include-details-of-interest-earned-and-status-of-total-assets-provide-a-sample-if-available-24\"></a>Describe the content, format and preparation process of performance reports.

Currently, there is no plan to run any adjacent marketing campaigns at an ecosystem level to help drive awareness or discoverability. By failing to amplify these programs, Arbitrum DAO faces the risk of considerable spending without effective outcomes.</p>\n<p>In response to the need for marketing coordination and support at an ecosystem level for the upcoming incentive programs, we are seeking funding of 238,500 ARB from the DAO to create various short-term marketing initiatives.</p>\n<p>The key proposed initiatives include developing a <strong>discoverability page, creating a unified brand identity and messaging for the programs, and executing a comprehensive content strategy</strong>. These efforts will address immediate marketing gaps and set a foundation for long-term strategic improvements. The proposal also outlines roles and responsibilities for the campaign, including coordination by 404 DAO, execution by Rogue House, and oversight by an Advisory Council.</p>\n<p>We are seeking feedback, questions, and suggestions for improvements to refine this plan and ensure the successful rollout of the incentive programs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>A few weeks ago the 404 DAO team posted a <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-enhancing-incentive-program-discoverability/23295\">RFC</a> exploring the idea of a discoverability page for the upcoming LTIPP and STIP.B incentive programs. We presented delegates with a few initial ideas on how Arbitrum DAO could create a central base for users to discover the participating projects and opportunities. Overall, the RFC was well-received by delegates and a community call on April 19th helped sparked a period of further market research.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"insights-from-market-research-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#insights-from-market-research-3\"></a>Insights from Market Research</h3>\n<p>In total, our team conducted 16 interviews with relevant stakeholders, including the Arbitrum Foundation, Offchain Labs (OCL), STIP participants, LTIPP applicants, delegates, and marketing leaders within the Arbitrum ecosystem. From these discussions, we were able to validate marketing needs in the short term and also uncovered some additional key insights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better coordination amongst stakeholders:</strong> A top concern from delegates, Arbitrum marketing leaders, and incentive program participants was the need for better coordination between OCL, the Foundation, and the DAO in developing marketing campaigns.</li>\n<li><strong>Program Awareness:</strong> While the majority of protocols and users within Arbitrum are up to date on the DAO’s grant programs, those in other ecosystems barely know they are happening. The average user in other ecosystems is especially unaware of the upcoming incentive programs and the opportunities that will be present across Arbitrum this summer.</li>\n<li><strong>Program Branding:</strong> The current method of grant program naming and subsequent branding is not competitive with other ecosystems. Ex. Base’s Onchain Summer specifically appeals to users.</li>\n<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Arbitrum as a whole needs to build out new distribution channels to reach users. Ex. Increasing Farcaster presence</li>\n<li><strong>Retention:</strong> A lot of money is being spent on attracting users, but we should also focus on how we keep these users on Arbitrum once incentives run out.</li>\n<li><strong>Ecosystem Support:</strong> For smaller teams, extensive marketing is likely an afterthought or something they don’t have the resources for yet. Ideas explored included:\n<ul>\n<li>Discounted rates for service providers</li>\n<li>A marketing liaison between the DAO and projects to help with messaging/copy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>DAO Branding:</strong> Arbitrum DAO itself has a brand problem and it can improve its image by highlighting its success stories. Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>At an ecosystem level, generate more content (blogs, research, threads, videos, etc) on the emerging projects that are bringing new innovation.</li>\n<li>The DAO has a ton of data and reports from its grant programs that are being underutilized as it’s hidden in the forums. The ARDC is already working on creating these types of <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-research-deliverables/23438\">reports</a> which can then be marketed to a wider audience to help share success stories.</li>\n<li>DAO managed social channels to help with social media amplification</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"constraints-considered-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#constraints-considered-4\"></a>Constraints Considered</h3>\n<p>Several of these insights and problems will have to be addressed over the long term but are important for the DAO to begin thinking about. When considering what we can accomplish in the short term for the upcoming incentive programs we considered the following constraints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scope\n<ul>\n<li>What is the minimum we can accomplish in the short term to ensure the programs are successful?</li>\n<li>While there is a need and interest from stakeholders for a more comprehensive top-down marketing strategy for DAO grant programs, a campaign needs to be narrowly focused and truly short-term.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Time\n<ul>\n<li>Incentives will begin rolling out in the next couple of weeks. What actions can we reasonably accomplish in a condensed time frame to ensure we achieve the desired results?</li>\n<li>How can we design a program that can move quickly but also has proper oversight from the DAO?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Funding\n<ul>\n<li>How can we secure sufficient funding to produce a high quality campaign?</li>\n<li>Given the time restraints, several contributors or service providers would have to be paid retroactively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"proposed-initiatives-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-initiatives-5\"></a>Proposed Initiatives</h3>\n<p>From our conversations with the key stakeholders (applicants, Foundation, OCL, delegates) and input from Rogue, we have determined that the following initiatives are feasible despite a tight timeline, each of which will be explained in greater detail further below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discoverability page\n<ul>\n<li>Tags on the Arbitrum Portal</li>\n<li>Layer3 Ecosystem Map</li>\n<li>Notion Hub</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A program facelift and unified brand kit for participants</li>\n<li>Internal Content Strategy - Ex.

However, when weighing all of the above constraints, our team decided the best approach was to bring this request directly to the DAO in order to have the necessary resources to produce a high-quality campaign.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-7\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Over the next 3 months, Arbitrum DAO will spend upwards of 60m ARB across the LTIPP and STIP Bridge incentives programs. Compared to other ecosystem campaigns like Base’s <a href=\"https://base.mirror.xyz/HoH9cZVi8CMdvxVUNjvOzceUPVQcVZvvkf8ZbCOVOco\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Onchain Summer II</a>, <a href=\"https://journey.mantle.xyz/en/nft\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Citizens of Mantle</a>, and even the Foundation’s <a href=\"https://portal.arbitrum.io/arcade\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum Arcade</a>, the DAO’s incentive programs are an order of magnitude larger in terms of funds being deployed, but there is currently no plan to rollout adjacent marketing support at an ecosystem level for either program. This proposal aims to address the current marketing/branding gap for the upcoming programs and help ensure that they achieve their intended purpose - to drive users, capital, attention and activity to Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>From the various stakeholder interviews conducted, the main concerns for short-term marketing revolved around driving initial awareness for the programs, ensuring attention lasted the entirety of the program, and exhausting all possible avenues for maximized distribution. The following proposed marketing plan attempts to address each of the 3 core pain points: Awareness, Discoverability and Distribution. More specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Attention at the ecosystem level. Do users know what is happening on Arbitrum? Are they familiar with the current programs and offerings orchestrated by the DAO?</li>\n<li><strong>Discoverability:</strong> Can users find the protocols offering incentives? Learn about the projects, what they do and how they can partake in their incentive campaigns.</li>\n<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Are we reaching new users, communities and ecosystems? Are we maximizing the potential of our incentive programs? Are we reaching the right users?</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-8\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<p>With this proposal, our first priority is to address the shortcomings of the incentive programs. While there are many initiatives we can undertake to improve the DAO’s marketing efforts, we see this program as a first step which provides the data and learnings necessary to make a more informed conversation on what a more robust long-term strategy is for the DAO.</p>\n<p>Our plan is to roll out a summer campaign with a targeted start date in mid June. While incentives for the LTIPP program are now expected to begin on June 3rd, we believe that this is a more realistic launch date for a coordinated campaign among participants and it is an acceptable tradeoff to have incentives begin a few weeks prior in return for a more complete campaign. Additionally, if this proposal is received positively on a Snapshot vote, some of the necessary planning work will begin. Below are the various initiatives that will be undertaken:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"discoverability-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#discoverability-9\"></a>Discoverability</h3>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum Portal</strong></p>\n<p>The official <a href=\"https://portal.arbitrum.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Abritrum Portal</a> is the current official ecosystem hub for Arbitrum. It serves as the discoverability page for all projects, Orbit chains, and specific campaigns like Arbitrum Arcade. We believe it is prudent to leverage this existing resource as much as possible, and our early conversations with OCL and the Foundation have been largely positive. In the short-term, we have confirmed with OCL that a tagging system will be in place for the duration of the incentive programs to help identify projects participating and allow for users to more easily find opportunities.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3e7618f4efa51a1d2dcd2e50f3e52022e6951943.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8UyCNPNQGHxA27cc9I3CcEwdr59.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3e7618f4efa51a1d2dcd2e50f3e52022e6951943_2_624x313.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"8UyCNPNQGHxA27cc9I3CcEwdr59\" width=\"624\" height=\"313\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3e7618f4efa51a1d2dcd2e50f3e52022e6951943_2_624x313.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3e7618f4efa51a1d2dcd2e50f3e52022e6951943_2_936x469.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3e7618f4efa51a1d2dcd2e50f3e52022e6951943_2_1248x626.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"19191B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>However, we do not expect a dedicated Incentive Program section due to the previously mentioned constraints and other limitations. We hope to see the Portal being used in future coordinated marketing efforts between the DAO, the Foundation, and OCL but this will be a long-term effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Layer3 Ecosystem Map</strong></p>\n<p>While we have seen some great ecosystem hubs built by contributors for the DAO, there is still room for something to be built with the end user as the sole target audience. Building a DAO owned ecosystem hub for this purpose is not feasible in the short term, so to increase discoverability and overall program awareness, we propose utilizing Layer3, who has built ecosystem maps &amp; programs in the <a href=\"https://app.layer3.xyz/linea-park\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">past</a>.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/919e5e42dc94c69a14b5cb73bb4876e728da8313.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kMcxcB3SRDfRDxf01VgmRlPDGwj.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/919e5e42dc94c69a14b5cb73bb4876e728da8313_2_582x292.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"kMcxcB3SRDfRDxf01VgmRlPDGwj\" width=\"582\" height=\"292\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/919e5e42dc94c69a14b5cb73bb4876e728da8313_2_582x292.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/919e5e42dc94c69a14b5cb73bb4876e728da8313_2_873x438.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/919e5e42dc94c69a14b5cb73bb4876e728da8313_2_1164x584.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"373A44\"></a></div><br>\n*Linea Park Exploration Map<p></p>\n<p>After multiple discussions with Layer3’s team they have the ability to design and build an Arbitrum ecosystem map specifically for the LTIPP &amp; STIP.b programs free of charge. This initiative would be 100% opt-in by the participants as some protocols have baked in a questing component within their applications and thus maintaining their freedom of choice (whether participation entirely or utilizing another questing provider) is important. The only additional information required from incentive program participants is the action they want highlighted as a quest. Layer3 will manage campaign design, marketing, and execution end-to-end free of charge.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that selecting a specific questing provider upfront is not an ideal practice, the shortened time frame limits our ability to court offers from different providers. We are confident in Layer3’s wide reach and ability to execute and believe the value added from having a questing hub for the incentives hubs is substantial. Additionally, with no additional cost to the DAO and the expedited lift time this will enhance the effectiveness of the incentive programs while allowing protocols the optionality to be involved or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Notion Hub</strong></p>\n<p>When considering what is a minimally viable discoverability page that the DAO can create before incentives go live, a dedicated Notion Dashboard appears the most feasible. The dashboard can provide complete and thorough information of the projects and their respective incentive campaigns all within a central hub. Additionally, this option allows for the most flexibility in content while also catering to all projects across STIP and LTIPP.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8d7cff0a9500315867d6229cafa5ffd31760098d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kbF7Qyn8N7MWyMHjsdeKLls5r5P.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d7cff0a9500315867d6229cafa5ffd31760098d_2_624x308.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"kbF7Qyn8N7MWyMHjsdeKLls5r5P\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d7cff0a9500315867d6229cafa5ffd31760098d_2_624x308.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d7cff0a9500315867d6229cafa5ffd31760098d_2_936x462.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d7cff0a9500315867d6229cafa5ffd31760098d_2_1248x616.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0EEED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sample mock-up, design not final</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The obvious drawbacks are the limited visibility and professional look that comes with a notion page. However, given that the DAO currently only has a complete list of participants in the form of a spreadsheet, this dashboard is better than nothing.</p>\n<p>The 404 DAO team has experience with creating dashboard type pages in Notion and will be owning the creation of this hub. Our team will be responsible for collecting the necessary information from participants and preparing a version to be presented to the DAO before incentives go live.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"program-visual-identity-messaging-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-visual-identity-messaging-10\"></a>Program Visual Identity &amp; Messaging</h3>\n<p>Over the last year Arbitrum DAO has fallen into the habit of creating very literal program names ex. Short Term Marketing Program. While this is great for internal DAO programs and communications, this is far from the ideal messaging we should be presenting to the end user. In several of our interviews, individuals shared that the incentive programs lacked a unified “look and feel”, and we believe naming is one of the main contributing factors to these concerns.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we propose bringing the programs together under one name for a summer marketing campaign. Brand assets would be created by Rogue House with assistance from the Foundation and Marketing Council. Projects would have templates and graphics to use in social content and announcements. This will especially be beneficial for smaller teams who may lack a complete marketing team to properly communicate their incentive offerings. Additionally, we anticipate a unified brand to help raise more attention and awareness across social media channels.</p>\n<p>Rogue House will assist in creating the following brand assets:</p>\n<p><strong>Program Visual Identity</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program wordmark design\n<ul>\n<li>Ideally its own identity, but has connections to the overall Arbitrum brand)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Color exploration &amp; guidelines (cmyk &amp; rgb)</li>\n<li>Typography Exploration &amp; Guidelines</li>\n<li>Brand kit for delivery in form of pdf &amp; working files\n<ul>\n<li>Social templates for X</li>\n<li>Final program wordmark</li>\n<li>Final colorway and typography</li>\n<li>Placement and use guidelines</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Program Messaging</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>External program messaging playbook including:\n<ul>\n<li>Program naming</li>\n<li>Program positioning and key messaging pillars</li>\n<li>Cohesive Program announcement and roll out messaging for Arbitrum projects\n<ul>\n<li>Including Internal &amp; external messaging for the Arbitrum community and broader web3 ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A unified name and brand kit will specifically addresses the following problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program fragmentation</li>\n<li>Branding cohesion</li>\n<li>Alleviates some marketing/design burden for protocols</li>\n<li>Allows for more digestible and appealing content for average users</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"awareness-content-campaign-strategies-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#awareness-content-campaign-strategies-11\"></a>Awareness: Content Campaign &amp; Strategies</h3>\n<p>In order to bring consistent awareness to projects throughout the entire duration of the incentive programs there needs to be a full-fledged content strategy. The creation of this strategy will be led by Rogue House, and while exact details of campaign still need to be crafted, the following is a breakdown of expected responsibilities and potential deliverables:</p>\n<p><strong>Program Launch Strategy &amp; Campaign Activation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cohesive communication &amp; distribution strategy across selected social channels announcing the start of the incentive program.\n<ul>\n<li>Roll out with new program name &amp; branding</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Creation &amp; coordination of the launch moment with every project participating in the incentives program, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Providing every project with announcement assets for social</li>\n<li>Creating a unified front across projects with clear call to action aiding in program discoverability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ongoing Content Strategy &amp; Marketing Maintenance:</strong></p>\n<p>Program Content Calendar, Including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program Content Pillars</li>\n<li>Posting cadence for content pillars</li>\n<li>Design templates for specific channels (Farcaster, X, Discord, TG)</li>\n<li>Suggested copy per channel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Potential Creative Campaign Direction &amp; Development</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ex. Project led spotlight series\n<ul>\n<li>This could look like X Spaces 3 times a week where we can have 5-6 projects speak each time so that we can get through 100+ in a month</li>\n<li>Short &amp; Long Form Spotlights (Daily or weekly): blogs, threads</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ex. KOL led activation\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the Programs aligned parties and individuals willing to support the initiative and build an organic distribution channel for amplification first</li>\n<li>Explore paid KOLs as a secondary form of communication</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ex. Community driven content challenge (bounties)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"what-does-success-look-like-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-does-success-look-like-12\"></a>What does success look like</h3>\n<p>This is the first DAO led marketing campaign to be proposed to date for the incentives program. We are starting from ground zero. In order to be able to do this on a broader scale for the DAO as a whole, we need to take a first step forward. What we will learn from this initial program experiment will provide foundational data in support of building long term campaigns we can actually benchmark against.</p>\n<p>It’s important to remember that while there are many things we could and can do in the future to support the incentives program, our north star goal for this initial proposal is focused on presenting a united ecosystem front for the launch and ongoing communication.</p>\n<p>This will look like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Re-naming of the program to something that can resonate with the broader community</li>\n<li>MVP brand toolkit specific for the rollout of the incentives program</li>\n<li>Clear call-to-action for all participating projects to distribute across social channels using Program branded assets during the initial launch moment</li>\n<li>Consistent messaging across 1-2 key social channels for the entirety of the program</li>\n<li>Singular location community members can go to explore and discover projects participating in the Arbitrum Incentives Program</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we can achieve the above and get participating Arbitrum projects brought into the vision for this program specifically, what is possible by bringing the entire DAO together becomes easier to imagine. While only one program, this is an opportunity to begin to reshape and mold our brand towards who we want to be and where we want to go.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"roles-and-responsibilities-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#roles-and-responsibilities-13\"></a>Roles and Responsibilities</h1>\n<p>To build out this program we have divided responsibilities into 4 roles: Advisory Council, Marketing Agency, Project Manager, and the Multisig Signers. Normally, we would consider it best practice to fill the agency and council roles with a more complete RFP or election process.</p>\n<p>However, when considering the narrow mandate of this program and the previously mentioned time constraints, our team believes this initiative is not possible if pushed through these processes. Therefore to provide additional accountability, the following Advisory Council members and Rogue House will not be automatically grandfathered into any longer term programs without either a more complete RFP process or DAO approval.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"advisory-council-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#advisory-council-14\"></a>Advisory Council</h2>\n<p>We recognize that creating a public campaign on behalf of the DAO while also using the Arbitrum brand is a large responsibility. In order to provide oversight and insights as materials are being crafted, we will form a Marketing Advisory Council composed of key stakeholders and marketing leaders within Arbitrum. These members each have extensive marketing experience and several are long standing Arbitrum community members:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blue - Trader Joe</li>\n<li>Sam I Am - Gains Network</li>\n<li>Alex Lumley - Savvy DeFi</li>\n<li>Shreddy - JonesDAO &amp; Radiant DAO</li>\n<li>George Heath - WOOFi</li>\n<li>Kseniia Baziian - Founder of Narrative Web3 Growth Lab &amp; Former CMO of Premia Finance</li>\n<li>Justin Vogel - Co-Founder of Safary Club</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Their role is to provide insight and oversight to Rogue as they work through asset and content creation, strategy, and execution. They are in place to ensure the DAOs best interest are kept a priority during the entirety of the marketing rollout.</p>\n<p>We are in the process of potentially confirming 2 additional members for the Advisory Council. If interested please reach out to <a href=\"mailto:governance@404dao.io\">governance@404dao.io</a> with a short paragraph outlining qualifications.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"marketing-agency-rogue-house-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#marketing-agency-rogue-house-15\"></a>Marketing Agency - Rogue House</h2>\n<p>Rogue will be responsible for leading the program facelift and overall marketing strategy and execution.

Describe any conflicts of interest your entity, its investors or key personnel may have with any potential service providers selected under the program</strong></em></p>\n<p>As part of our due diligence process and commitment to uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency, we have conducted a thorough review of potential conflicts of interest concerning our entity, its investors, and our key personnel in relation to any service providers considered under the program.</p>\n<p>Our investigation includes examining the personal and financial relationships that our staff, management and major investors might have with potential service providers. To date, our internal audits and declarations collected from relevant parties have not identified any conflicts of interest. All our team members and investors have confirmed that they do not hold any direct or indirect financial stakes, employment relationships or contractual engagements with the prospective service providers. We maintain rigorous policies to avoid any conflicts of interest, including routine disclosures and a strict ethical code that mandates reporting of any potential conflicts.</p>\n<p>We are prepared to provide affidavits and further documentary evidence to certify the absence of conflicts, ensuring full compliance and transparency in our engagement with selected service providers.</p>\n<p><em><strong>7. Under what situations would you make a recommendation for Arbitrum to withdraw its assets from a selected service provider to fulfill each aspect of the outlined scope in the appendix?</strong></em></p>\n<p>To ensure a robust and tailored recommendation for potentially withdrawing Arbitrum’s assets from a service provider, it is imperative to conduct a thorough and balanced analysis of the DAO’s investment objectives and requirements. This process involves developing a customized risk-return profile for the DAO, which will serve as a foundational element in setting customized red flag indicators and thresholds across the relevant areas outlined in the appendix.</p>\n<p>Drawing on industry standards and leveraging our Digital Asset Risk Rating Framework, we propose the following key considerations for decision-making:</p>\n<p><em><strong>1. Cashflow &amp; Accrual Monitoring</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Recommendation for Withdrawal:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Initial Capital Contribution and Redemption Tracking:</strong></em> Initiate an inquiry if discrepancies or delays exceed 7 business days and recommend withdrawal if no satisfactory resolution is reached within an additional 7 days, considering the impact on cash flow and operational needs.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Interest Accrual or Payment Tracking:</strong></em> Trigger an alert if deviations from expected payments exceed 3% and initiate a formal review at 5% deviations, considering both the frequency of these occurrences and their financial implications on the DAO’s treasury.</p>\n<p><strong>Interest Payment Frequencies:</strong> Recommend reassessment of the service provider if mismatches between actual and documented payment frequencies occur more than once in a fiscal quarter, taking into account the provider’s explanations and the consistency of their communication.</p>\n<p><em><strong>2. Underlying Asset Monitoring</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Recommendation for Withdrawal:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Asset Allocation Compliance:</strong></em> Alert if non standard assets exceed 5% of total portfolio and recommend withdrawal if the issue is not rectified within one month, considering the risk exposure and potential impact on the DAO’s investment strategy.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Portfolio Reporting:</strong></em> Implement quarterly reviews if reports are inaccurate or delayed by more than 10 days; recommend withdrawal if inaccuracies persist in subsequent reports or if the provider fails to meet the corrective actions agreed upon.</p>\n<p><em><strong>AuM Reporting:</strong></em> Conduct a review if the percentage of the product’s AUM pertaining to Arbitrum’s investment is inaccurately reported by more than 3% and recommend withdrawal if such inaccuracies occur twice within a year.</p>\n<p><em><strong>3. Operations &amp; Counterparty Monitoring</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Recommendation for Withdrawal:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Audit and Financial Reporting:</strong></em> Recommend withdrawal if financial and audit reports are not submitted within 15 days of the due date or if two consecutive reports fail to meet transparency standards, considering the operational risk and potential financial implications.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Service Provider Changes:</strong></em> Recommend an operational review if there are significant changes in key operational roles or management more than once in six months and consider withdrawal if these changes lead to a decrease in service quality or increased operational risk.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Material Changes in Terms:</strong></em> Recommend a strategic review if material changes are not communicated at least 30 days in advance or sooner if negative impacts on the DAO’s operations are anticipated.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Redemption Tests (Fire Drills):</strong></em> Recommend withdrawal if more than one test in a 12-month period fails to meet the agreed-upon timelines, especially if these delays could significantly impact liquidity.</p>\n<p><em><strong>4. Strategic Communication and Documentation Oversight</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Recommendation for Withdrawal:</em></p>\n<p>Governance Forum Communication: Recommend procedural adjustments if responses to significant inquiries take longer than 48 hours without adequate justification, considering the quality and effectiveness of communication in maintaining trust with stakeholders.</p>\n<p><em><strong>5. Additional Considerations for Potential Withdrawal:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Beyond the areas outlined in the appendix, it is crucial to consider further dimensions in any decision-making process concerning the potential withdrawal of allocated capital. The following areas are based on our practical experience, particularly important to evaluate, for which we as program managers can also provide additional quantified materiality thresholds in future collaboration.</p>\n<p><em>a) Regulatory Compliance:</em></p>\n<p>Continuously monitor the regulatory compliance status of the issuer in their home country, target markets and concerning investments by the DAO. Include an assessment of any emerging requirements such as new licenses or permits that may impact the viability of the investment.</p>\n<p><em>b) Market Presence and Reputation of the Service Provider:</em></p>\n<p>Assess the market presence, reputation and strategic orientation of the service provider. Consider the risks of reputational damage through detailed reviews of stakeholder engagement, transparency and the background of the corporate structure and its related entities.</p>\n<p><em>c) Risk Management and Internal Controls of the Service Provider:</em></p>\n<p>Review the robustness of the issuer’s existing risk management processes and the effectiveness of their internal controls. This should include an evaluation of how these processes integrate with the DAO’s risk management framework.</p>\n<p><em>d) Operational Resilience, Governance, and Security:</em></p>\n<p>Analyze the operational resilience, governance structures and security measures of service providers, especially regarding disaster recovery, business continuity plans and ongoing security protocols.</p>\n<p><em>e) Custody Solutions and Competitive Analysis:</em></p>\n<p>Evaluate existing custody solutions with a focus on license compliance, insurance coverage, asset segregation and technical security. Perform a competitive analysis to ensure these solutions meet the highest industry standards.</p>\n<p><em>f) Third-Party Interactions and Pricing Mechanisms:</em></p>\n<p>Scrutinize interactions with third parties, such as the use of external data (Oracle) for token pricing mechanisms and the implications of functionalities like rebasing on pricing stability. This should include comparisons with established public pricing resources.</p>\n<p><em>g) Code Integrity and Functionality:</em></p>\n<p>Assess code integrity risks, especially in terms of the roles assigned to internal and third-party functions within the token’s operational framework.</p>\n<p><em>h) Liquidity and Trading Patterns:</em></p>\n<p>Monitor liquidity and trading patterns for signs of bottlenecks or manipulated volumes, such as unexplained spikes or declines in trading activities, which can indicate underlying issues.</p>\n<p><em>i) Investor Structure and Concentration Risks:</em></p>\n<p>Analyze the distribution of token holders and wallet concentrations to identify clumping risks that could affect liquidity and market stability.</p>\n<p><em>j) Legal Liabilities and Challenges:</em></p>\n<p>Evaluate the exposure to potential legal liabilities that could arise from multinational legal interpretations or limitations within the service provider’s terms and conditions. This includes a review of jurisdictional risks and the legal structure of contracts.</p>\n<p><em>k) Ownership and Valuation of Assets:</em></p>\n<p>Verify ownership rights associated with tokens, particularly how they relate to underlying assets and their valuation. Perform correlation analyses to ensure the token’s value accurately reflects the underlying asset’s fair value.</p>\n<p><em>l) Performance Benchmarking:</em></p>\n<p>Develop and maintain an index for active benchmarking of service providers to identify performance deficiencies and guide strategic portfolio rebalancing.</p>\n<p><em><strong>8. Please list any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organizational structures</strong></em></p>\n<p>To date, there is no project-related experience in working with decentralized organizational structures.</p>\n<p><em><strong>9. What is the value of assets monitored by your entity?</strong></em></p>\n<p>As of 14 May 2024, our entity is responsible for monitoring tokens across more than 20 asset classes, with a total market capitalization of USD 7.7 billion.</p>\n<p><em><strong>10. Can you explain how risk management (investment and operational) is being done for assets under monitoring?</strong></em></p>\n<p>Our risk management process is designed to safeguard the integrity and enhance the value of assets under our monitoring, incorporating both automated systems and manual oversight to ensure comprehensive coverage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Automated Monitoring and Alerts:</strong></em></p>\n<p>We utilize sophisticated software systems to continuously monitor a wide range of on- and off-chain metrics across the assets and the service providers we are monitoring. Our sources include both public and private data - ranging from websites and third-party data providers to tracking transaction volumes, asset allocations and smart contract activities. Monitoring occurs event-based or in real-time. Automated alerts can be configured to notify management teams if certain predefined thresholds are breached. We also enforce predefined risk limits and controls, such as maximum exposure limits for specific asset classes or individual investments, to prevent excessive concentration risk. This automation enables the DAO to respond quickly to potential issues, reducing the latency between detection and action.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Manual Assessments and Reviews:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Alongside our automated systems, our risk management process relies on manual assessments conducted by our experienced analysts. These assessments include detailed reviews of financial and audit reports to verify accuracy and compliance with transparency standards. Scenario analysis and stress testing are also conducted to evaluate potential investments under various market conditions. Manual oversight extends to evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls at the issuer or service provider level, ensuring they align with our stringent requirements.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Compliance and Regulatory Monitoring:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Our risk management includes a strong focus on compliance and regulatory adherence. We regularly review the regulatory compliance status of all issuers and service providers in relation to their home countries and target markets. This process involves assessing any new licenses, permits or regulatory changes that might impact the viability of the investment or its operational framework. Our compliance efforts are strengthened by continuous monitoring of legal changes in 30+ countries, ensuring our information remains current with the latest regulatory developments.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Information Security:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Our information security, based on SOC 2 and ISO 27001 principles, emphasizes the implementation of comprehensive controls and policies to safeguard data and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. We’ve implemented access controls, encryption and regular monitoring, to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Strategic Reviews and Counterparty Analysis:</strong></em></p>\n<p>We conduct strategic reviews that encompass market presence, reputation, operational resilience, governance and security assessments of service providers. These reviews help us evaluate potential risks from changes in key operational roles or management within service providers that might affect service quality or increase operational risk.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Operational risk management also involves detailed planning and testing of disaster recovery and business continuity strategies. This process includes analyzing data from ‘fire drills’ conducted by the service provider to evaluate the efficacy of these plans. Such testing ensures robust data recovery capabilities and operational resilience under adverse conditions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Integration with Internal Controls and Adjustments:</strong></em></p>\n<p>The insights gained from both automated and manual monitoring are integrated with our internal control systems. This integration allows us to make informed decisions and adjust our risk management strategies dynamically. Regular internal audits are conducted to evaluate and enhance these processes, ensuring that our thresholds and triggers in our automated systems are appropriately set based on the requirements of the DAO, evolving risk landscapes and internal audit feedback.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Reporting and Documentation:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Detailed documentation is maintained for all risk management activities. This includes documenting the rationale behind each decision made in response to alerts, discrepancies or any other issues identified during monitoring. Regular reports are generated and disseminated to relevant stakeholders, providing transparency and facilitating ongoing evaluation of our risk management effectiveness.</p>\n<p>We refer to section 11 for further information on the preparation of reports.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Stakeholder Engagement and Communication:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Maintaining open channels of communication with all stakeholders, including timely responses to inquiries and concerns, is pivotal. This ensures that all parties are aligned and informed about the governance and risk management measures in place. The frequency and channels of communication can be individualized based on needs and requirements of the DAO. In addition Particula has implemented appropriate deputization rules for key personnel.</p>\n<p><em>A comprehensive flow chart for our risk management process can be found here:</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jdqF_uHc5bo9AbGuEoBVkLTegmB5b0Qv/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Proposal - Risk Management Process Flow<br>\n</a></p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the content, format and preparation process of performance reports. This should include details of interest earned and status of total assets. Provide a sample if available.</strong></p>\n<p>Performance reports are designed to provide comprehensive insights into the performance of investments, detailing interest earned and the status of total assets. The aim is to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are well-informed, enabling effective decision-making and ongoing management of the DAO’s investment portfolio. In this regard the reports can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the DAO, offering flexibility in both format and delivery method:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Content:</strong></em> Each report can include detailed breakdowns of interest earned over the reporting period and a current assessment of the total assets under management. This ensures stakeholders have a clear view of returns and asset growth or depreciation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Format:</strong></em> Reports can be provided in various formats to suit different stakeholder preferences, including interactive web applications, direct API feeds for real-time data integration or traditional PDF documents delivered via email.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Preparation Process:</strong></em> Data for these reports is meticulously gathered and verified through our established analytical processes. It is compiled from reliable on- and off-chain sources and calculated using both proprietary and industry-standard methods to ensure accuracy. To enhance the data integrity, we provide access to our partner portal for all service providers. This enables the direct supply and verification of data points from independent third-party sources as well as from the service providers themselves. Prior to dissemination, each report undergoes a rigorous review by our analytics team to confirm its integrity and relevance.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Delivery Frequency:</strong></em> Depending on the DAO’s needs, reports can be scheduled for delivery on a monthly, weekly or daily basis. This frequency can be adjusted as required to keep pace with the dynamic nature of the portfolio and the DAO’s operational tempo.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Customization:</strong></em> The scope and detail of reporting are customizable, allowing stakeholders to receive information that aligns closely with their investment objectives and requirements. For example, a Risk Rating Report from Ondo $OUSG, which we have attached as a reference, provides a model of such tailored financial reporting.</p>\n<p>Sample Report: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17wXvBUFxs-ZL9i9DPBpgYxBosTsmfhbx/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ondo - Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries ($OUSG)</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6f3c855bfbfffe85f8f4a7f5e4ce8bd1b6d8019a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fS2FdcvjgCqyar49i569xQQoNWa.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6f3c855bfbfffe85f8f4a7f5e4ce8bd1b6d8019a_2_446x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"fS2FdcvjgCqyar49i569xQQoNWa\" width=\"446\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6f3c855bfbfffe85f8f4a7f5e4ce8bd1b6d8019a_2_446x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6f3c855bfbfffe85f8f4a7f5e4ce8bd1b6d8019a.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6f3c855bfbfffe85f8f4a7f5e4ce8bd1b6d8019a.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"A3B3B7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>IV.

We built a new way that will allow users to earn ARB tokens on a regular basis by completing quests and collecting points. However, the feature development took longer than expected and was later impacted by the Hedgey hack. We are working hard to re-enable the feature so that users participating in Tide campaigns can receive ARB tokens on a daily or weekly basis.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The previous STIP round revealed some valuable lessons. Initially, our strategy for distributing rewards was cumbersome and slow to implement. We found that contacting projects and coordinating quest campaigns on Tide, with Tide rewarding users with ARB tokens, involved extensive back-and-forth communication before each campaign launch. However, as the program progressed, we refined our approach. We introduced a series of campaigns called “Tsunami”, organized entirely by Tide on behalf of partner projects. Each campaign would require on-chain actions on Arbitrum. This streamlined process proved to be highly successful, with over 11 thousand unique participants in just one week. We collaborated with 10 major projects in the ecosystem, distributing a total of 44k ARB tokens (<a href=\"https://www.tideprotocol.xyz/users/spaces/1881\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Join this Space on Tide</a>).</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>100K ARB</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal? [Y/N]</li>\n</ol>\n<p>N</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are going to use the incentive in a similar way as highlighted in section 3. We will organize a series of campaigns where multiple projects will have one campaign organized by Tide on our platform. An example of this is the Tide Tsunami campaign series. (<a href=\"https://www.tideprotocol.xyz/users/spaces/1881\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Join this Space on Tide</a>) . We would like to launch more series like the Tide Tsunami (two of 50k ARB distributed) with more protocols involved.</p>\n<p>We are planning to distribute the remaining tokens from the previous STIP (around 15k) together with this new STIP Addendum for completing the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>launch 2 series of Tsunami campaigns of around 40/50K ARB each with old and new partners that are building on Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The remaining ARB will be utilized to incentivize Tide community engagement via Tide’s innovative new feature, Cycles. Cycles enable projects to periodically distribute tokens based on users’ accumulated points. This engagement tool holds significant potential benefits for projects. Benefits include better and longer engagement as users are rewarded on a daily or weekly basis. Users are therefore incentivized to use protocols more often because the only way to be eligible to earn rewards is by completing quests every day/week to collect points. Points are then translated into ERC20 rewards.</p>\n<p>Moreover, projects that use Cycles distribute the rewards more efficiently and effectively during the campaign period. This allows projects to constantly improve their campaign strategy.</p>\n<p>Tide is also working on building sybil resistant campaigns using allow lists, the integration of Gitcoin Passport and the Humanode discord role verification task. Therefore, projects on Arbitrum will benefit from our sybil resistant solutions linked to Cycles</p>\n<p>So far the quest model is not flexible (do X get Y), Tide is making it more sophisticated combining actions with continuous rewards.</p>\n<p>Our sybil protection mechanisms also prevent bots and low quality users.</p>\n<p>Tide will utilize all remaining ARBs to reward users through Cycles. The STIP represents an opportunity for Tide to introduce a novel distribution method. Users will be able to claim daily or weekly ARB rewards from their favorite projects. Only users gaining points through quests completion and campaigns are eligible.</p>\n<p>Tide allows projects to launch campaigns and simple quests that ask users to complete social (Twitter and Discord) and on-chain tasks such as verifying swaps, liquidity providing, NFT holding, minimum balance, minimum number of transactions and more. Every task completion rewards users with points that add up on a leaderboard. Tide’s leaderboard, therefore, is now not only a gamification and competition tool but also a way to reward users that participate in campaigns and quests. All of this is possible with Cycles and this STIP addendum plays a fundamental role in allowing the testing of this feature with ARB rewards.</p>\n<p>Example of Cycle campaign tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily swap with project X on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Hold TVL on Arbitrum for n days</li>\n<li>Bridge to Arbitrum every day</li>\n<li>Deposit on a landing protocol on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Mint NFTs on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Hold Gitcoin passpord/Humanode credential</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Grant Breakdown: Using the funds to launch acquisition and retention campaigns on Tide</p>\n<p>Funding Address: arb1:0xe199d0CA24306cFA5BAee371b821fE5B1edF3456</p>\n<p>From the funding address we would send part of the funds to projects that would then distribute the funds as rewards to users.

experience?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pain point: there is the Arbitrum forum, however the communication is often not clear. We’d like to have some reference people that are responsible for keeping contact with companies that received the STIP and are available in case of doubts or questions.</p>\n<p>Incentive programs for web3 marketing platforms like Tide are very useful as they promote activity on projects working on Arbitrum while rewarding many participating users with small rewards. For example, the series of the Tide Tsunami campaigns was able to reward more than 11k users with chunks of 100ARB each. This was done in one week, however if the campaign would have lasted longer we believe numbers would also be higher. This spreads the ARB tokens to many users instead of just a few.</p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 8 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tide-protocol-stip-addendum/23804\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tide-protocol-stip-addendum/23804","pubDate":"Tue, 14 May 2024 15:03:41 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23804"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tide-protocol-stip-addendum/23804.rss","#text":"Tide Protocol STIP Addendum"},"filter":false}]}}}
