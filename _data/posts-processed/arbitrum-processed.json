Bridge assets on the Arbitrum deployment are currently only USDC.e and WETH.  This design ring-fences the risk of each pool, allowing a wider range of assets to be onboarded than more common single pool protocols.  Any markets with willing-lenders, such as Curve LP tokens and Pendle PT tokens, can be created.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"base-and-bridge-assets-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#base-and-bridge-assets-5\"></a>Base and Bridge Assets</h3>\n<p>Silo categorizes assets as either bridge or base assets. Bridge assets are defined assets per deployment useable as collateral in any silo, while base assets are any asset other than bridge assets.</p>\n<p>Bridge assets refer to predefined assets that may be used as collateral or deposited into any silo in a deployment.</p>\n<p>Bridge Asset deposits are only exposed to the silo they are deposited into. For example, if $USDC is deposited into the $ARB silo, its exposure is limited to $ARB (the base asset) and $ETH (the secondary bridge asset) only. An exploit in the $PENDLE silo will not affect $USDC deposits in the $ARB silo since they are standalone markets.</p>\n<p>Bridge Asset deposit rates are derived from the IRM configuration for that specific silo. More aggressive models may be applied to riskier silos (e.g., low on-chain liquidity), allowing counterparty lenders to receive more interest to reflect risk exposure.</p>\n<p>Base assets refer to any non-bridge asset that has a lending market on Silo. Base assets can theoretically be any token, including standard and esoteric tokens.</p>\n<p>Base assets can only be used as collateral in their own market.

Occasionally, there is demand to borrow base assets for purposes like shorting, hedging, or yield arbitrage, which generates yield for lenders. GMX, PENDLE, RDNT, LUSD, and weETH were generally the base tokens that generated the most yield.</p>\n<p>Users depositing tokens as collateral usually deposit base tokens and borrow either USDC.e to leverage their exposure to the base token price or borrow WETH to leverage their exposure to the token’s yield.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"impact-on-total-bridged-asset-lending-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#impact-on-total-bridged-asset-lending-16\"></a>Impact on Total Bridged Asset Lending</h3>\n<p>The launch of STIP rewards was transformative for Silo Finance in attractive lending capital.  USDC.e deposits received most of the incentives, but over time, as Pendle PT markets and LRT markets launched, WETH deposits overtook them in total value supplied.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the STIP program, total bridged assets supplied increased 332% from $13m to $56m.  The total dollar amount of this growth was relatively evenly split between USDC.e and WETH; however, when measured in percentage terms, the growth of WETH is much higher at 581% vs 229% for USDC.e.</p>\n<p>Since the end of the STIP program, USDC.e deposits have fallen 46% from $30m to $16m.  This highlights how sensitive USDC.e suppliers are to incremental yield.  The conclusion of the STIP program also coincided with a general spike in stablecoin yields across DeFi which could have cannibalized some of Silo’s yield-earning suppliers.</p>\n<p>WETH deposits, however, have continued to grow, increasing a further 36% since the program ended.  The favorable environment of yield and airdrop farming of LRTs via looped lending on Silo directly and through Pendle PT tokens has supported this growth.  The successful bootstrapping of these markets on Silo over the STIP has worked out favorably for Silo and Arbitrum DeFi generally, as leverage seekers have a deep, liquid venue for their strategies.</p>\n<p>Currently USDC.e supplies are up 76% since the start of the STIP program, and WETH supplies up 825%.  This leaves bridged asset supplies up 3x, a similar level to the end of the program.  <strong>This clearly demonstrates a significant, lasting impact from the use of incentives in growing bridged asset lending.</strong></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/p3a3N7Ifdpvg8Tb8qbJ00L5rdaC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Silo Arbitrum Bridged Asset Deposits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e_2_574x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Silo Arbitrum Bridged Asset Deposits\" data-base62-sha1=\"p3a3N7Ifdpvg8Tb8qbJ00L5rdaC\" width=\"574\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e_2_574x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e_2_861x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/af91dc2ff916bac8c4b40b24d6e9d730fb15c35e.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"272D2E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/n25CiGkzy9PHXikSZh0LaaocNRD.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Share of Bridge Assets Supplied on Silo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1_2_574x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Share of Bridge Assets Supplied on Silo\" data-base62-sha1=\"n25CiGkzy9PHXikSZh0LaaocNRD\" width=\"574\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1_2_574x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1_2_861x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a16e7ffbcf68a08b9b5aac700a216867ad9ad5a1.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"374E5A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"bridged-asset-borrower-reactions-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#bridged-asset-borrower-reactions-17\"></a>Bridged Asset Borrower Reactions</h2>\n<p>As the supply of bridged assets flowed to Silo at the start of the STIP, it was immediately lent out.

This effort paid off as early markets such as the WBTC market, with a large potential size and good elasticity with respect to incentives, grew rapidly, growing supplies and borrowing on the protocol.</p>\n<p>Another important trend Silo leant into was the rise of levereged restaking using Pendle and LRTs.  This accounted for a significant portion of growth, and directing incentives to these markets aggressively helped significantly.</p>\n<p><strong>Grew External Integrations</strong></p>\n<p>Silo announced many external integrations over the course of the STIP, broadening their funnel of value into the protocol.  The most successful of these, with Pendle, now makes up the two largest markets.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple Incentive Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>Incentives subsidized borrowing and lending where the Silo team determined they would be most impactful.  This resulted in easy to understand and optimize for incentive criteria, allowing a wide range of users to see benefits and onboard to Silo.</p>\n<p><strong>Horizontal Expansion by Launching New Markets</strong></p>\n<p>New markets drove significant growth on Silo, which continued after the STIP ended.  Twelve new markets were launched over the STIP, with 6 now in the top ten markets on the protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintaining Momentum with a Native Token Incentive Program</strong></p>\n<p>After the completion of the STIP, Silo launched a native incentive program to continue their momentum.

Between January-March 2024, the DAO was spending an average of 13.8M ARB per month, or roughly $15M, with 90%+ of the spend going towards attracting users through protocol incentives programs. The risks associated with the DAO’s current treasury structure are widely acknowledged (negative feedback loop where excessive ARB spend leads to price depreciation and therefore treasury devaluation), with many teams currently working on proposals for treasury management strategies.</p>\n<p>However, there has been less conversation and research put into the topic of DAO revenue, which today is primarily driven through sequencer margin. Sequencer margin is the result of the difference between the fee charged to end users and the costs for data availability and settlement on Ethereum. The motivation behind this post can best be explained through two charts: Image 1 (H/t <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/r3gen_finance\">@r3gen_Finance</a>) shows the DAO’s ETH net fee flow between March 2023-March 2024, whereas Image 2 shows the same data set extended through May 2024.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a5107d02ec4e22b284299a11ba5732a72ff63b07.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nye6JQ5xbqiIixTc59V1MtEgaNx.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"r3gen Arb ETH Treasury Flow\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a5107d02ec4e22b284299a11ba5732a72ff63b07_2_690x315.jpeg\" alt=\"r3gen Arb ETH Treasury Flow\" data-base62-sha1=\"nye6JQ5xbqiIixTc59V1MtEgaNx\" width=\"690\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a5107d02ec4e22b284299a11ba5732a72ff63b07_2_690x315.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a5107d02ec4e22b284299a11ba5732a72ff63b07_2_1035x472.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a5107d02ec4e22b284299a11ba5732a72ff63b07.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E1EBF1\"></a></div><br>\n<a href=\"https://dune.com/David_C/arb-one-profits-and-ecosystem-stats\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6501b284fa09f31eeee5f907e868c4ac363c5a9d.jpeg\" alt=\"Arb ETH Treasury Flow Post Atlas\" data-base62-sha1=\"epxRnT0I6DX0sawkSiAYQtvVEuN\" width=\"690\" height=\"335\"></a><p></p>\n<p>As one can easily point out, the amount of ETH flowing into the DAO’s treasury has essentially gone flat since the end of April 2024. The root cause of this was two protocol changes that came with the <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbos-20-atlas-da106378326b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbOS Atlas upgrade</a> on March 18, shortly after the implementation of EIP-4844 on Ethereum. The L1 surplus fee per compressed byte was lowered from 2 gwei to 0 gwei, essentially removing the L1 surplus fee altogether, and the minimum L2 base fee was reduced from 0.10 gwei to 0.01 gwei. While this has been a benefit to users, developers, and protocols, it has come at the expense of the Arbitrum DAO’s primary revenue stream. We believe the reason for the mismatch in timing between the fall off in DAO revenue and the aforementioned upgrades was simply a delay in funds being officially transferred from the fee inbox to the <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xbfc1feca8b09a5c5d3effe7429ebe24b9c09ef58#internaltx\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DAO’s treasury timelock</a>.</p>\n<p>The following chart breaks down Arbitrum’s fee revenue at a more granular level, which shows the significant decrease in daily revenue around the middle of March. The L2 base fee had historically served as the DAO’s main revenue driver, but has been overtaken by L2 surplus fees since the ArbOS Atlas and EIP-4844 upgrades went live.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2914457/4843759?Select+Date+Granularity_e15077=week&amp;Select+Timeframe_e15077=90\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/071036cbaed615ecab806e2ec93df3607804b83c.jpeg\" alt=\"Base / Surplus Breakdown\" data-base62-sha1=\"10u50j6rmADmBWGmw4IWMC1vsD2\" width=\"690\" height=\"295\"></a></p>\n<p>For the 71 days between January 5 (2024) to March 17, the DAO generated ~2,125 ETH of profit. For the 71 days between March 18 and May 27, the DAO generated ~938 ETH of profit, with nearly half of that coming from a two day period in April where L2 Surplus Fees were abnormally high due to congestion fees kicking in. So even though a statistical outlier heavily skews the post-upgrade profit numbers to the upside, the DAO’s ETH revenue was still down greater than 55% with higher day-to-day variance in DAO profit than the pre-upgrade era.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Base and Optimism have begun to regularly surpass Arbitrum in weekly profit generation despite Arbitrum consistently seeing a higher level of onchain activity. It is worth noting that if changes were to be made to Arbitrum’s gas pricing mechanism, it could put downward pressure on overall activity due to the increase in costs. However, another important factor to consider is the hefty amount of ARB incentives available across dozens of applications on Arbitrum, whereas Base (the most profitable Ethereum L2) does not have the luxury of a token. This begs the question – should the DAO charge slightly more for gas while incentives are plentiful in order to recoup some of the spend? Or is this approach missing the forest for the trees by focusing too heavily on short term profits over attracting and retaining users for the long-term in an effort to reach economies of scale?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2914457/4843759?Select+Date+Granularity_e15077=week&amp;Select+Timeframe_e15077=90\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6cd4f3e69d080e9e494cef9b7752d4783bbbbc20.jpeg\" alt=\"Rollup Sector Chain Profit\" data-base62-sha1=\"fwLOAusFesrswXY50FqoI285RG8\" width=\"690\" height=\"332\"></a></p>\n<p>Popular transaction types, such as a Uniswap swap, already <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/1064888/1829300\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">cost</a> 2-5x less on Arbitrum than OP Stack chains on most days.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4e33eeac77ebb3a90488e5648a1cd3cae77c9a77.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/b9OvrAafhYqNnbHenluFbET81ZZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"Uniswap Swap Fee 7D MA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4e33eeac77ebb3a90488e5648a1cd3cae77c9a77_2_690x402.png\" alt=\"Uniswap Swap Fee 7D MA\" data-base62-sha1=\"b9OvrAafhYqNnbHenluFbET81ZZ\" width=\"690\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4e33eeac77ebb3a90488e5648a1cd3cae77c9a77_2_690x402.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4e33eeac77ebb3a90488e5648a1cd3cae77c9a77_2_1035x603.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4e33eeac77ebb3a90488e5648a1cd3cae77c9a77_2_1380x804.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"091121\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The following table taken from the Paradigm team’s recent <a href=\"https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/04/reth-perf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">research</a> on Reth outlines target gas parameters across leading EVMs.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8d819624b5c2a9ea548791ac6fb527d3a0779c2a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kbOXAyMluuK3SqBBuPbdVmShxjQ.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Gas Targets\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d819624b5c2a9ea548791ac6fb527d3a0779c2a_2_690x482.jpeg\" alt=\"Gas Targets\" data-base62-sha1=\"kbOXAyMluuK3SqBBuPbdVmShxjQ\" width=\"690\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d819624b5c2a9ea548791ac6fb527d3a0779c2a_2_690x482.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d819624b5c2a9ea548791ac6fb527d3a0779c2a_2_1035x723.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8d819624b5c2a9ea548791ac6fb527d3a0779c2a_2_1380x964.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The target gas per block is in practice where congestion pricing kicks in. The lower the target gas, the more quickly L2 surplus fees begin to scale. Interestingly enough, Base contributors <a href=\"https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1795572376555712551\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">recently</a> increased its target gas per block in order to scale up to 6.25 mg/s, and is aiming to increase it again soon to achieve 7.5 mg/s. So it appears the Base team favors the “lower fees, reach economies of scale” approach mentioned above. OP Stack chains do not apply a hard-coded minimum L2 base fee as Arbitrum does, but instead have a maximum base fee increase or decrease per block (2% and 0.4% respectively as default) that adjusts based upon how far above or below a given block is from the predefined gas target (5M target gas per block by default). Arbitrum leverages something similar to OP Stack chains, as both mechanisms mimic EIP-1559 in many ways, called a “backlog” that monitors gas usage against a “speed limit” in an effort to ensure long-term sustainability by avoiding excessive gas usage. The base fee increases exponentially if the backlog grows, but decreases as the backlog shrinks. <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/inside-arbitrum-nitro#the-speed-limit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Quoting the documentation</a>, “F = exp(-a(B-b)), where a and b are suitably chosen constants: a controls how rapidly the price escalates with backlog, and b allows a small backlog before the base fee escalation begins”.</p>\n<p>Another key difference between OP Stack chains and Arbitrum is that Optimism orders transactions based on priority fees, whereas Arbitrum operates its sequencer using the FIFO model. According to this <a href=\"https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-bedrock-priority-fee-monitoring\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">query</a>, Optimism saw 25% of transactions over the past 30 days use a priority fee greater than 0.10 gwei, which ironically is where the Arbitrum minimum L2 base fee was set prior to Atlas. To provide a more detailed explanation of the impact of priority fees, we can look at the following spike on Base for “fast” priority fees at 15:31 UTC on May 29.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dune.com/payton/base-l2-gas-price-tracker\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a7670ee1eefe4fa82b4ff0ee4a1afc239156318d.jpeg\" alt=\"Priority Fees\" data-base62-sha1=\"nSUxonF5y2KWtgHFOO8XifA6nZX\" width=\"690\" height=\"315\"></a><br>\nThis is what blocks typically look like on Base:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://basescan.org/blocks\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e8ffe05f692a5ee913e97fffacca22159f0b35eb.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"xfcZ7SWmwlcvMyWpVJLHwtCR9Kb\" width=\"605\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\"></a></p>\n<p>However, at the time of 15:31 UTC on May 29, blocks were consuming far more gas, and priority fees escalated as a result (for those curious, the cause looks to be related to a gas intensive, ERC-4337 related operation coinciding with a public NFT mint):</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8097adaf27db2f54ae4e8beea20d72de1bd5bd8d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ilA5jQ1UqsDYcLFtJybGhMLnWK9.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8097adaf27db2f54ae4e8beea20d72de1bd5bd8d_2_601x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ilA5jQ1UqsDYcLFtJybGhMLnWK9\" width=\"601\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8097adaf27db2f54ae4e8beea20d72de1bd5bd8d_2_601x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8097adaf27db2f54ae4e8beea20d72de1bd5bd8d_2_901x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8097adaf27db2f54ae4e8beea20d72de1bd5bd8d.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F9FB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This priority fee auction appears to be a large driver of OP Stack chains’ sequencer revenue, and could potentially be explored for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>More research needs to be conducted on the exact inner-workings of Arbitrum’s gas pricing mechanism in order to make any concrete recommendations. It appears to Entropy Advisors that there are 3 paths to effectively increasing fees:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increase the L2 minimum base fee from 0.01 gwei to something agreed upon by the DAO. In our opinion, this is the simplest option and is the least likely to have negative effects on various ecosystem participants.</li>\n<li>Decrease the target gas per block, effectively kicking in congestion fees earlier.</li>\n<li>Adjust the “a” in the exponential backlog formula ( F = exp(-a(B-b)) ) to increase the rate of change to the base fee during times of congestion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Adjusting constant “a” has the benefit of letting the market decide the gas price, but it could have significant consequences if implemented irrationally. On the other hand, simply raising the minimum base fee would have more predictable effects, but some folks prefer the free market to price resources. Adjusting the target gas per block would likely have similar advantages and drawbacks as adjusting constant “a” in the aforementioned exponential function of the backlog. Again, significantly more research and backtesting is required before we attempt an executable proposal, but we wanted to get the conversation started considering the disparity in ETH sequencer earnings between Arbitrum and other leading Ethereum L2s.

It’s a small enough change that data could be collected and analyzed with more drastic changes being implemented later. It is also a relatively fast measure to implement barring the DAO voting process, so we could quickly begin accruing more ETH to the DAO treasury in the midst of heightened activity, and thus extending the DAOs runway and helping protect it against ARB price fluctuations.

This is more than we spend on entertainment, connecting with friends and family, or gaming. CollabTech is what we call those tools that we use to work together - efficiently, at scale, and with more freedom.</p>\n<p>The traditional corporate world calls these tools “B2B SaaS”, which is a key business vertical with a market valued at <a href=\"https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/b2b-saas-market/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">USD 327.74 Billion (2023)</a>. It is projected to reach USD 1088.15 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 18.7% (using data from B2B SaaS). CollabTech can be thought of as the next generation of B2B SaaS, built on decentralized blockchain technology (or Web3).

It is a very early example, but also a cautionary one. Web3 CollabTech remains largely underdeveloped despite its long history. On top of the challenging volatility of the space, important setbacks have included large-scale hacks (e.g. The DAO), ill-conceived forms of governance that led to the quick rise and downfall of DAOs as a meme, lack of sustainable business models in NFT communities, and an adverse regulatory environment in the USA. These early and frequent setbacks have reduced interest in the category and led to it being frequently misunderstood - placing it in the canonical Trough of Disillusionment. </p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1e7968b7e1bd1da47355d94622b9983072b44ea.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/n6h2Y4pUht62ClBAKtSauBOnH86.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1e7968b7e1bd1da47355d94622b9983072b44ea_2_666x500.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"n6h2Y4pUht62ClBAKtSauBOnH86\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1e7968b7e1bd1da47355d94622b9983072b44ea_2_666x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1e7968b7e1bd1da47355d94622b9983072b44ea.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/a1e7968b7e1bd1da47355d94622b9983072b44ea.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F3F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<aside class=\"onebox wikipedia\" data-onebox-src=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">en.wikipedia.org</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    \n\n<h3><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gartner hype cycle</a></h3>\n\n<p>The Gartner hype cycle is a graphical presentation developed, used and branded by the American research, advisory and information technology firm Gartner to represent the maturity, adoption, and social application of specific technologies.

Namely:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s a large market with low competition and high potential for blockchain utilisation</li>\n<li>Web2 CollabTech is ripe for disruption and Web3 can address key failure points</li>\n<li>CollabTech provides new use cases for Orbit chains and other Arbitrum infrastructure</li>\n<li>Collabtech already has traction in Arbitrum and leads generation of sequencer fees</li>\n<li>It enables positive social impact and positive narratives</li>\n<li>And it serves as an ideal stepping stone to innovate in venture building</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"large-market-low-competition-and-high-value-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#large-market-low-competition-and-high-value-3\"></a>Large Market, Low Competition, and High Value</h3>\n<p>CollabTech is a market valued at USD 327.74 Billion (2023), projected to reach USD 1088.15 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 18.7% (using data only from B2B SaaS).</p>\n<p>Currently, the CollabTech vertical lacks a clear leader amongst L2s/L1s. Polygon has set a dedicated initiative to target Web2 customers with Web3 B2B tools, Optimism is attracting some key projects (funding DAO Spring amongst others), and Q blockchain is making some progress, but no one has yet managed to become the go-to place for CollabTech builders.</p>\n<p>Typical applications without the need for intensive resources, like CRM systems, are now budgeting 10% of their revenues just for cloud services. Resource-intensive businesses (e.g. bigdata-as-a-service) tend to allocate up 20% to 40% of their revenues to pay for cloud services. On top of this, there is about 147 zettabytes of data expected to be generated by the end of 2024. Bridging even 10% of this to web3 would create massive growth for L1 and L2s, not only in the number of transactions but also in overall data processed on-chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"a-market-ready-for-disruption-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#a-market-ready-for-disruption-4\"></a>A market ready for disruption</h3>\n<p>The Web2 CollabTech stack is heavily fragmented, with financial assets, governance, accounting, and other systems all living in silos. Blockchains offer a solution to this issue, and can lead to all organisations (whether decentralized or not) eventually moving on-chain.</p>\n<p>Web3 can improve the current tooling because B2B SaaS all get built on key concepts that Web3 is uniquely suited for (Identity and Permissions of people and objects, Attestation and Verification, Agreements and Commitments, Communication and Data Management, etc). There’s a massive opportunity for B2B SaaS tools to evolve and become truly collaborative and unlock new ways of connecting, automating, and working together.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"arbitrum-traction-generation-of-sequencer-fees-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#arbitrum-traction-generation-of-sequencer-fees-5\"></a>Arbitrum Traction &amp; Generation of Sequencer Fees</h3>\n<p>CollabTech is already the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> sequencer fees generator in Arbitrum thanks to <a href=\"https://x.com/Flynnjamm/status/1750526681289568402\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Quest Protocol </a>(RabbitHole), and with the right strategy, the success of Quest Protocol could be emulated by a host of projects and position Arbitrum as the leading ecosystem for innovators in this soon to be $1,000bn+ market.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"orbit-chains-unlock-privacy-and-new-use-cases-for-arbitrum-infra-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#orbit-chains-unlock-privacy-and-new-use-cases-for-arbitrum-infra-6\"></a>Orbit chains unlock privacy and new use cases for Arbitrum infra</h3>\n<p>As Web3 matures out of Wild West casino culture, the below applications offer valuable niches for commercially sustainable projects and long-term value creation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The UX of blockchain applications with gas fees, bridging, and data transparency has made it tricky to build many applications, especially for B2B tech which often requires data privacy and where paying customers and users are often different people.<br>\nBut now, chains with customisable privacy like Orbit chains that can settle to a universal trust layer offer a powerful unlock, especially when we consider AI-powered products and features with onchain computing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The evolution of the gig economy also serves as a driving force for CollabTech applications onchain. Protocols to connect recruitment markets and contracting for small tasks and fluid teams benefit from eliminating web2 walled gardens, so that matchmaking is unrestricted and reputation portable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally, inventory and account management (ERP), CRMs, permission and access systems, and data management systems currently suffer from high platform risks (single points-off-failure vendors capriciously changing the system, pivoting or going bankrupt), architectures that only enable integrations as an afterthought, and closed source code which creates trust issues and limits the ability of customers to customize or build on top.<br>\nThese legacy collaboration tools can be disrupted through modularity &amp; composability, trustlessness, and easy automation, providing a great use case for blockchain-based dApps and protocols.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, unlocking autonomous agents within B2B tooling has unique advantages for planning, coordination, and resource efficiency. Pairing AI with blockchains as data layer and transaction layer enables trustlessness, automation, and advanced governance and permissioning to power the organizations of tomorrow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"improving-ops-and-governance-for-arbitrum-projects-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#improving-ops-and-governance-for-arbitrum-projects-7\"></a>Improving Ops and Governance for Arbitrum Projects</h3>\n<p>CollabTech is a key enabler for other projects. Early examples show how the existence of a quality multi-sig solution was key for increasing TVL in L1s and L2s as well as enabling projects to operate effectively.</p>\n<p>More recently, we cite the importance of protocols for decision-making, role attribution, grant tracking, creating quests, etc., as key for enabling ArbitrumDAO and Arbitrum-based projects to move fast, build strong communities, and achieve results.</p>\n<p>By leveraging tools for voting, proposal management, and consensus-building, collaboration technology empowers communities to steer projects with unprecedented transparency and democratic engagement. It enables collective decision-making and governance beyond the confines of traditional hierarchical systems. As the backbone of decentralized projects, collaboration technology not only streamlines governance processes but also enhances operational efficiency, making it indispensable for sustaining the growth and resilience of Web3 initiatives.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"positive-social-impact-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#positive-social-impact-8\"></a>Positive Social Impact</h3>\n<p>Thanks to web3 innovations, CollabTech is a key vertical to addressing the $8.8 trillion lost per year in employee disengagement, the incredibly low trust in Institutions, and the chronic opportunity cost attributable to poor coordination.</p>\n<p>It eradicates barriers to participation, ensuring that every stakeholder has a voice in shaping the future. Moreover, this technology fosters a culture of open collaboration and innovation, where ideas can be shared and refined collectively. CollabTech opens up new business opportunities, creates jobs, and promotes a more inclusive economic model where value is distributed more equitably among contributors leading to a more sustainable and resilient digital economy.</p>\n<p>The challenges of current DAO designs led many idealists to temper their excitement, but the opportunity to reinvent democracy, make governments transparent instead of corrupt, build the future of work, and improve the lives of billions is still there for the taking.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ideal-springboard-to-innovate-in-venture-building-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#ideal-springboard-to-innovate-in-venture-building-9\"></a>Ideal Springboard to Innovate in Venture Building</h3>\n<p>There is a lack of supply of legitimate web3 companies opening new real markets. To solve this problem, we need to grow the industry’s capacity to develop new commercially viable projects. One of the ways in which we can address this is by leveraging venture builder models to create small clusters of complementary ventures, thereby creating a flywheel.</p>\n<p>Once you have several projects that define a category in a certain location, investors become acquainted with it and provide more funding. Once there is funding it becomes more attractive for entrepreneurs to choose to build towards it, compounding network effects.</p>\n<p>One can argue that CollabTech is not the most popular area in Arbitrum. However, if you want to push the boundaries to improve how we develop new commercially viable projects, CollabTech is possibly the best vertical to play with because of the natural deep expertise of the community there on how to collaborate.</p>\n<p>Even if you ignore all the potential benefits of improving Ops and Governance in the Arbitrum DAO and Arbiturm-based projects, and discount all the on-chain activity of the resulting ventures, the CollabTech community is still particularly well-positioned to reinvent venture building and generate models, tools, and methods to replicate the approach across verticals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"an-opportunity-for-vertical-specialization-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#an-opportunity-for-vertical-specialization-10\"></a>An Opportunity for Vertical Specialization</h3>\n<p>There was a time when you could know every major project in Ethereum. That time is long gone. The number of projects and innovations is expanding rapidly in verticals like DeFi, Gaming, DeSci, CollabTech, NFTs/creative, etc. Without specialisation, it’s impossible to keep up and this situation will only intensify over the next few years as the number of projects and verticals increases.</p>\n<p>Specialization enables the support system for ventures to keep up with new developments and add real value. Every vertical has a different technical palette, market configuration, and social network; with specialized support, we’re in the best position to select which projects to back and help them navigate challenges.</p>\n<p>CollabTech has especially suffered from neglect in specialization. Organization design, leadership, group psychology, behavioral economics, and political science are not new disciplines. Yet the DAO movement has often reinvented the wheel and repeated mistakes while being slow to test ideas coming from self-management, cybernetics, and similar bodies of value-aligned theories and practices.</p>\n<p>In Web2, we have seen how, in CollabTech, older and more experienced entrepreneurs have higher chances of success (in contrast to consumer verticals). This is due in large part to CollabTech being a B2B market where relationships carry a premium and a deep understanding of the complexities of organisations is key to developing commercially viable solutions. In CollabTech, the experience and networks that specialisation enables are particularly valuable.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-11\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Collaboration Technology stands as a blue ocean market, fertile ground for developing new use cases for Arbiturm products (especially Orbit Chains), and a bedrock upon which the Arbitrum ecosystem—and indeed, the broader Web3 landscape—can thrive. From enhancing operations and governance to optimizing resource allocation and task coordination, its role is pivotal. It not only fosters innovation and competitive advantage but also drives significant economic and social impacts. Finally, CollabTech is an ideal vertical to validate the Swarms approach (which can then be copied across verticals) and provide network effects for Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>As such, prioritizing robust development and support for Collaboration Technology is not merely an option but a necessity for the sustained growth and resilience of the Web3 economy. By doing so, we ensure a future where digital collaboration is not just efficient but transformative, creating an inclusive, dynamic, and equitable ecosystem for all participants.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/is-collabtech-valuable-for-arbitrum/24703\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/is-collabtech-valuable-for-arbitrum/24703","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Jun 2024 14:57:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24703"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/is-collabtech-valuable-for-arbitrum/24703.rss","#text":"Is CollabTech valuable for Arbitrum?"},"filter":false},{"title":"Analysing impact and performance of previous ARB incentive programs (STIP, Backfund, LTIPP) - LTIPP Research bounty - PYOR","dc:creator":"PYOR","category":"LTIPP Bounties","description":"<p><strong>Our Proposal</strong><br>\nWe are proposing to analyse the impact of the three incentive programs run by the Arbitrum DAO and measure their impact on the eco-system and ROI. This will be achieved by analysing the pre and post-incentive performance of Grantees. Key areas that will be addressed are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Analysing growth in the user base and cross-usage of protocols amongst users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analysing changes in user behaviour and frequency: Avg no of transactions per user, fee per user</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analysing the cost of acquiring users through CAC and the payback period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Calculate the lifetime value (LTV) of users and LTV / CAC ratio.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analysing the quality of users through retention cohorts and repeat ratios.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build and analyse the behaviour of various Grantee segments (By scale, size and business category). Segments will be made by dividing Grantees into groups with similar characteristics or behaviours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Benchmarking of ARB eco-system metrics with comparable L2s across metrics and protocol activity.

Incentive spend constitutes a significant portion of the foundation’s spend and allocating it for the right projects is most important for the long-term growth of the ecosystem. Our work will answer the following questions amongst several others:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the ideal set of protocols for DAO to fund and support through Grants based on their Sector, Scale and traction? Understand if DAO should double down on established protocols or if DAO should make bets on newer projects. Or DAO should fund a DEX or a lending protocol etc.</li>\n<li>What is the optimal size of the grant to generate maximum impact?</li>\n<li>What is the ROI of various segments and who were the best-performing and worst-performing segments/grantees?</li>\n<li>For a sample set of sectors analyse why they underperformed or overperformed through analysis and discussions with Grantees/community members.</li>\n<li>Create a leaderboard of performers based on varied sets of metrics e.g. which segments created the most sticky users (best retention cohorts), which segments are driving Daily active user growth, and which segments drive maximum TVL.</li>\n<li>What sectors DAO should attract and fund more based upon the sector performance on Arbitrum vs sector performance on another ecosystem? Identifying market demand for certain protocols, mechanisms, and profit-driven actions</li>\n<li>What were the unique incentivization strategies implemented by the Protocols to attract new and recurring users? and what other protocols can be learned from it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Methodology</strong><br>\nWe will segment Grantees based on different parameters and will conduct Pre and Post analysis of those segments for all 3 programs(STIP/ Backfund STIP and LTIPP).</p>\n<p><strong>Segments for Grantees</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Based on sectors<br>\nProtocols will be aggregated based on the services they offer.<br>\nMajor categories will be</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Dexes</li>\n<li>Perps</li>\n<li>Lending / Borrowing</li>\n<li>Options</li>\n<li>CDPs</li>\n<li>Yield</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Based on the size of the Grant</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the predefined quantitative methodology, protocols will be divided into ‘High’, ‘Medium’ and ‘Low’ categories.</li>\n<li>The methodology for the categorization will be documented and presented separately.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Based on the protocol Size/scale/recency (when was the protocol launched)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the predefined quantitative methodology, protocols will be divided into ‘Large’, ‘Medium’ and ‘Small’ categories.</li>\n<li>The methodology for the categorization will be documented and presented separately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Metrics for performance analysis for protocols and segments</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cumulative users</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculate the total users who have used the protocol and ARB since inception</li>\n<li>Monthly breakdown of new vs existing users showing how many new users were acquired in each week</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Daily and monthly active users:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily Active Users (DAU)</li>\n<li>Monthly Active Users (MAU)</li>\n<li>Ratio of DAU / MAU</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Breakdown of DAU, MAU &amp; DAU/MAU by new vs existing users:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>New to the respective protocol</li>\n<li>New to Arbitrium</li>\n<li>Existing users of Arbitrium.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Breakdown of DAU, MAU &amp; DAU/MAU by new vs existing users:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Retention cohorts for each protocol and overall for the ARB ecosystem show retention at 1W, 2W, 4W, and 8W.</li>\n<li>Frequency: Analyse the Average number of transactions per week per user for Protocol and Arbitrium.</li>\n<li>Economics: Analyse trends in Average fee per transaction for protocol and overall Arbitrium.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Analyse trends in user behaviour and activity by segmenting users based on :</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Existing vs New wallets</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Age of Wallet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Based on the ARB balance in the wallet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Did they hold ARB before the program</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nature/business of dapps interacted with e.g. Dexes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nature of activity mercenary miners, institutional investors, traders etc</p>\n<p>(Segments for this section will be defined quantitatively and documented appropriately with the reasoning behind the decisions.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Analyse the overlap between the Protocols that received grants in STIP and LTIPP:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Segment users by how many protocols they interacted with e.g. 1, 2, 3 etc</li>\n<li>Analyse the difference in the business performance of wallets which interacted with different numbers of Protocols (Retention, behaviour, metrics).

It expands on existing discussions/designs of “DAO Owned Liquidations” for CDP protocols. Liquidations are always prevented by automatically pulling more collateral from the DAO treasury, increasing the collateral ratio of the loan.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pilot-phase-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pilot-phase-3\"></a>Pilot Phase</h3>\n<p>This pilot is designed to give the DAO sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding borrowing stablecoins against assets in the treasury, and the confidence to use our proposed solution safely.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum community is seeking ways to more efficiently and effectively use the capital in the treasury. The strategies for grant programs, Mergers and Acquisitions, long term investments, and treasury sustainability seek sustainable solutions that minimize required sell pressure on the ARB token.</p>\n<p>The treasury currently has about $3.8B USD worth of ARB tokens. Long term diversification of this is key, but the community also needs access to capital now for grants, treasury management, M&amp;A, and more. Developing an alternative strategy for accessing stablecoins gives Arbitrum DAO more options and power.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-terms-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-5\"></a>Key Terms</h1>\n<p>CDP - Collateralized Debt Position. A type of financial primitive used by protocol like Maker, Open Dollar, Reflexer, etc… Collateral backs stablecoins with required loan to value ratios.</p>\n<p>Liquidation - an event which happens when the value of collateral backing a loan is less than the value of the loan, or below a required threshold. This forces the collateral to be sold in order to pay back the debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<p>The DAO should have the option to borrow stablecoins against its ARB and other future assets. However, using traditionally structured lending protocols creates too much risk of liquidation. Our proposed solution is a Treasury Backed Vault that severely limits the liquidation risks and lets the community achieve its goals with open access to its capital.</p>\n<p>Liquidations are mitigated by a “savior module” connected to a CDP position. The savior module adds an additional step between a vault being marked for liquidation and becoming liquidated. The module automatically pulls more ARB tokens directly from the DAO treasury (or elsewhere), adds them to the collateral of the position until it is raised above the liquidation threshold, and completely prevents liquidations from occurring. Any time liquidation on the DAO’s position is called, the savior activates first. The module contract would be given an allowance of ARB tokens by the Treasury to spend, allowing the Arbitrum DAO to completely control and at any time update the bounds of how many tokens can be pulled from the treasury.</p>\n<p>Example usage of Treasury Backed Vaults:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO deposits 1,000,000 ARB, worth $1,500,000 in a CDP protocol like Open Dollar or others where Treasury Backed Vaults are enabled.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO gives a TBV savior module permission to spend an additional 1,000,000 ARB, which remains in the DAO treasury. The DAO sets parameters with the savior.</li>\n<li>Arbitrum DAO borrows 1,000,000 stablecoins worth $1,000,000</li>\n<li>Due to market conditions, the price of ARB drops 33% suddenly, and the position is under the required collateralization ratio. It is now up for liquidation.</li>\n<li>Anyone calls the public function to liquidate the position. The vault is marked for liquidation.</li>\n<li>Before liquidation occurs, the savior module is automatically called. It has been set with specific parameters by the DAO to pull an additional 1,000,000 ARB from the treasury and deposit it in the vault.</li>\n<li>The position now has 2,000,000 ARB deposited in it, and is safely over the collateralization requirements. No liquidation happens and no additional votes were required to manage the position safely.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"steps-to-implement-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-7\"></a>Steps to Implement</h1>\n<p>The implementation is essentially split into 4 phases</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Research and Development</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A team of 3 solidity developers design, build, and document Treasury Backed Vaults with support for Arbitrum DAO specifically in mind.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Risk Analysis</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A team of 2 financial analysts complete a report on suggested parameters and the greater ecosystem impact of different borrowing scenarios for Arbitrum DAO. This will come with many helpful recommendations that future delegates can lean on to make proposals to use the vaults how they choose.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Audit</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A public audit contest will be conducted and managed by our team to review the security of the smart contracts of the TBV. This is important to complete at this stage because we want the DAO to be able to feel confident in the readiness of the system. A formal security report will be published and summarized in a post to the DAO. Audit reward recipients will be required to complete compliance and KYC before receiving funds.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Reporting</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the end of the pilot a report will be made to the DAO that includes results of the security audit, documentation on using TBVs, and results of the risk analysis. The report will include recommendations like how much ARB should be allowed to be pulled by a TBV to limit risk, how many stablecoins could safely be borrowed at a time if the DAO should choose to use the TBVs, how much sell pressure on ARB could be avoided in different scenarios, suggested collateralization settings, and other parameters for real usage.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-8\"></a>Timeline</h1>\n<p>Overall time to project completion: ~2.5 months</p>\n<p>Research and Development, done asynchronous with risk analysis reporting: 1.5 months</p>\n<p>Security audit and reporting: 2 weeks</p>\n<p>Complete report for the DAO and documentation on usage: 2 weeks</p>\n<h1><a name=\"team-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#team-9\"></a>Team</h1>\n<p>Research and development will be completed by a designated team made up on contributors to Open Dollar and led specifically by <a href=\"https://github.com/cupojoseph\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CupOjoseph</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/pi0neerpat\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pi0neerpat</a>.

How can the devs advertise their shitcoin to normies if they must complete dozens of steps just to purchase it? Well, they can pay ~$25,000 and enable card payments for the shitcoin.</p>\n<p>Or… they can use Toob.Finance for free! With the lowest fee on the market (3.8% versus 5-10% + $25k listing), no listing fee - all Arbitrum tokens are “listed” by default. Just drop the contract address and buy with a card.</p>\n<p>What is Toob Finance?<br>\nA product brought to the Arbitrum Ecosystem by Toob Dog - a memecoin on Arbitrum. We felt the need to allow card purchases as we did some advertising for normies on IG. Some joined the TG and asked how to buy Toob. Now, explain to someone with 0 experience with crypto how to DeFi, Metamask, Uniswap, Contract Address, ETH, Gas Fees, Networks.

We aim to empower our developer base and secure Arbitrum as a leading force in innovation and growth within the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Born out of the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-6-builder-pathways-towards-adoption/21510\">Betting on Builders</a> proposal from GovHack at ETHDenver 2024, we are presenting a collaborative accelerator program strategy, expected to run from Q3FY2024 through Q4FY2025. This strategy acts as a proof-of-concept for a pathway that any accelerator initiative can participate in. To begin, <a href=\"https://www.evmcapital.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EVM Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rndao.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RnDAO</a> and <a href=\"https://outlierventures.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Outlier Ventures</a> are partnering on this proposal to launch the initiative, collect data, and establish best practices.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this document is to detail our understanding of the current landscape, present a vision for advancement, propose a practical strategy, and provide specific outcomes and KPIs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thankarb-a-strategy-framework-platform-for-arbitrum-s-success/19130\">ThankARB</a>, which gathered data from 15,000 respondents within the ecosystem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We have more developers than most chains, but we don’t currently know how to best mobilize them for the benefit of the ecosystem.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We would like to try our hand at answering this question. Some opportunities for developer mobilization, which we intend to enhance with the “Infinite Launchpad” include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhancing Builder Onboarding and Support</strong>: Offering highly-tailored support at all stages (Idea through Series A) will prepare projects for commercial success or investment.</li>\n<li><strong>Creating Positive Feedback Loops</strong>: As Arbitrum’s technological stack evolves, builders can leverage the technology and benefit from their own contributions to its advancement, ensuring a symbiotic progression for both the platform and the projects it supports.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical support and product feedback</strong>: Providing technical guidance and iterative feedback is invaluable during the transition from alpha/beta stages to full project launches.</li>\n<li><strong>Enterprise contracts and funding</strong>: Providing subsequent funding opportunities for mature projects. While initial grants facilitate early-stage development, there is a void in support for scaling projects to a level where they can attract significant enterprise interest and investment, crucial for long-term sustainability and impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>To address these needs, we are asking the DAO to allot $10m in ARB from Q3FY2024 through Q4FY2025 for a program to enhance the Arbitrum developer and startup ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This initiative is designed to aid our ecosystem of developers, startups, and enterprises by providing a clear incubation track that propels innovations that include but are not limited to governance, process automation/ AI, financial infrastructure, and on-chain reputation through the help of direct collaborations with 100+ commercial partners.</p>\n<p>As teams go through the Programs, we can onboard them as Arbitrum customers, integrate them with the software stack, platforms or protocols, and support them as they become adopted in the ecosystem. If the product has significant traction, we can assess bringing them deeper into the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>How this fits into <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/thankarb-a-strategy-framework-platform-for-arbitrum-s-success/19130\">Arbitrums strategic priorities</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Robust DevRel</strong>: Establishing a custom-tiered DevRel program with robust, accessible, and responsive tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance optimization</strong>: Identifying and iteratively improving key capabilities to increase DAO performance and accountability.</li>\n<li><strong>Future-proofing</strong>: Strengthening our capacity to scale Arbitrum software adoption.</li>\n<li><strong>Growing the community</strong>: Awareness, participation, efficient inquiry handling, and bias reduction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional key value opportunities for Arbitrum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Developer feedback</strong>: As the incubated projects build on Arbitrum, we can collect direct and honest feedback to be distributed to Offchain labs, Arbitrum Foundation, and other stakeholders to refine their roadmap and improve Arbitrum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Builder representation and visibility</strong>: Showcasing teams composed of individuals representing their given region, background and culture - building with Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mutual reputation building</strong>: Participating teams can enhance their credibility by claiming involvement in an Arbitrum-funded accelerator program, while also promoting the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaborative research and knowledge sharing</strong>: Research findings will be shared as insight reports, highlighting market opportunities and supporting ongoing learning and improvement for all DAO working groups (M&amp;A, Arbitrum Ventures Initiative, Foundation Grants program, Questbook programs, etc). This can be used as a public good to refine the ecosystem’s approach and de-risk capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alpha</strong>: The early development stage of a product, typically for internal testing and refinement.</li>\n<li><strong>Beta</strong>: When a more advanced version of a product is released to a broader audience for testing and feedback before the official launch.</li>\n<li><strong>Series A</strong>: When startups begin to raise capital to scale their business after the initial seed stage.</li>\n<li><strong>GTM</strong>: “Got-to-Market” strategy and execution plan for launching a startup’s product and acquiring customers.</li>\n<li><strong>MVP</strong>: “Minimum viable product” the simplest version of a product to gather feedback for future development.</li>\n<li><strong>PoC</strong>: “Proof of Concept” stage where startups validate the feasibility and viability of their product or technology.</li>\n<li><strong>EiR</strong>: Entrepreneur in Residence” an experienced entrepreneur who provides mentorship, strategic guidance, and assistance in establishing valuable business connections.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The “Betting on Builders” suite of programs work together to support projects at any stage of their journey, guiding them seamlessly from inception through Series A and beyond.

This post is aimed at sharing the technical details of this process. We share it after a technical deep dive pursued by ScopeLift, in collaboration with Tally and other Arbitrum stakeholders.</p>\n<p>No specific action is required by community members at this time. Instead, we share this post for transparency purposes, and welcome any feedback or questions the community might have.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"technical-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#technical-summary-1\"></a>Technical Summary</h3>\n<p>ScopeLift will upgrade the Arbitrum Core Governor and the Arbitrum Treasury Governor. The new Governors will have the same feature set as the current Governors with the following additional features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proposal Cancellation</strong>: During the proposal delay phase, before the voting period has started, the delegate who put the proposal onchain will have the right to cancel it. This means voting on the proposal will not proceed. This feature comes in handy in many scenarios, notably in the instance that a malformed proposal is submitted in error. In such a case, the situation can be rectified without a mass effort to notify delegates to vote against it.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible Voting</strong>: We will add ScopeLift’s <a href=\"https://flexiblevoting.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">extension</a> to the Governor which allows delegates to cast rolling, fractional votes. This is most useful when smart contract delegates are used to roll up the votes of many pooled token holders. Use cases this extension will enable include voting with tokens in DeFi, shielded voting, voting from Orbit chains, and more. Note that this extension has been <a href=\"https://blog.openzeppelin.com/scopelift-flexible-voting-audit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audited</a> and will soon be <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/5045\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">part of</a> the OZ standard Governor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ScopeLift will <strong>not</strong> upgrade the Governors using the proxy upgradeable contract pattern. The contracts will <strong>not</strong> be upgraded in place by pointing the proxies to a new implementation. Upgrades via proxy are less flexible, more time consuming, and more error prone. In the case of the Governors, a superior upgrade path is available, as described below.</p>\n<p>ScopeLift will first assemble and extensively test new Governor contracts. The contracts will be audited, then deployed on Arbitrum One. ScopeLift will then coordinate with <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Frisson</a> as the delegate who will submit proposals to each existing Governor which will transfer the proposer role on the Timelock contracts to the new Governors.</p>\n<p>If the proposals pass and execute, the new Governors will become the entry point for Arbitrum Governance moving forward. The old Governors will continue to exist onchain, but will be vestigial, with no ability to actually execute proposals.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"faq-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#faq-2\"></a>FAQ</h3>\n<p>This approach might raise a number of questions. We will attempt to anticipate and answer them below.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: How will delegates know to propose and vote through the new Governors after the upgrade?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Upgrading Governors by transferring Timelock ownership is a common pattern, and Tally is set up to handle it. Immediately after the upgrade executes, Tally will be updated to use the new Governor contracts, while all historical vote data sourced from the old Governors will still be visible in the client.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Won’t upgrading the Governors require moving the treasury and assigning protocol permissions to the new contracts?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. The Timelock contracts hold the Treasury ETH and protocol permissions, because the Timelock is the contract that ultimately executes Governance proposals. This allows us to upgrade the Governors (where virtually all the logic related to governance lives) without needing to move funds or reassign protocol permissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: How will other Governance proposals be impacted by the upgrade?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Any proposal that executes before the upgrade proposal will not be impacted, even if voting on the upgrade proposal has already begun. Any proposal that is either queued or being voted on when the upgrade proposal executes could be left in limbo<sup>1</sup>. For this reason, we suggest the DAO plan to avoid non-critical proposals during the upgrade voting window.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will the new contracts be proxy upgradeable?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. Although using proxy upgradeability is not preferred in general, there are scenarios where it might be the right tool for the job. For example, adding a simple view method to the Governor might best be accomplished through a small proxy upgrade. Leaving this tool in the DAO’s toolbox is helpful. Thus, the new Governor contracts will be deployed as Transparent Proxies, using the same Proxy Admin as the existing contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will customizations made by Arbitrum to the Governor contracts be carried forward to the new Governors?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. Namely, the new Governor will have all the features provided by the extension from which it <a href=\"https://www.contractreader.io/contract/arbitrum/0x065620d99e1785ccf56fa95462d3012eb844fdc9#l2arbitrumgovernor-1-30-25\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">inherits</a>. It will also have the custom <code>onlyOwner</code> <a href=\"https://www.contractreader.io/contract/arbitrum/0x065620d99e1785ccf56fa95462d3012eb844fdc9#l2arbitrumgovernor-1-30-105\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">relay functionality</a>, and the fractional quorum which <a href=\"https://www.contractreader.io/contract/arbitrum/0x065620d99e1785ccf56fa95462d3012eb844fdc9#l2arbitrumgovernor-1-30-127\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">excludes specific tokens</a> from the quorum calculation.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is upgrading the Governors risky?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: If done carelessly, a botched upgrade could certainly cause problems. This is why ScopeLift will exercise great care in performing the upgrade.</p>\n<p>In particular, ScopeLift will assemble the new Governor using the latest version the OpenZeppelin contracts upgradeable library, along with ScopeLift’s fully audited Flexible Voting extension. We will then write a large suite of tests and simulations to ensure the upgrade will be successful, and that all DAO operations will be able to proceed normally after it is completed.</p>\n<p>Based on our previous experience with Gitcoin, PoolTogether, Radworks, and others, we expect this test suite will include hundreds of tests and thousands of lines of code.</p>\n<p>These tests simulate the upgrade to the new Governor, from deployment, proposal, Governance vote, and future votes by the DAO. The tests run on a “forked” state from Arbitrum One to simulate the closest possible production state. They exercise all scenarios before and after the upgrade, and ensure governance will still function properly after it is completed.</p>\n<p>We will also write scripts for deploying the new Governor and for submitting a proposal for the upgrade to the existing Governor. The scripts will be exercised by the tests.</p>\n<p>All tests and simulations are specific to Arbitrum. They exercise the actual code that is live on the network in a simulated environment. They will ensure the upgraded Governor can manage the DAO treasury and execute its role within the protocol.</p>\n<p>These tests will be written as fuzz tests and invariant tests, meaning they will take random arbitrary inputs rather than hardcoded parameters. We will execute millions of scenarios through these tests before proceeding.</p>\n<p>The entire codebase will be carefully audited by the OpenZeppelin team before being deployed. Finally, the tests will also be updated to run with the actual, deployed bytecode, and with the proposal calldata, once both are live onchain.</p>\n<p>ScopeLift has executed on this process for other DAOs. With these safeguards in place, we are confident the upgrade can be completed with minimal risk and without disruption to the DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"timeline-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-3\"></a>Timeline</h3>\n<p>ScopeLift has already begun preliminary work on this process, and will be accelerating on it in the weeks ahead. We are aiming to complete the work by the end of June, such that the contracts can be audited in early July. The DAO should expect a proposal for the upgrade to be submitted in mid-July at the earliest.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><sup>1</sup> It is, in fact, possible to graft old proposal state onto the new governor so that even mid-flight proposals stay valid. This approach would increase complexity and risk, and on balance, we don’t find it worthwhile vs. the alternative, i.e. a short window during which no new proposals should be created.</p>\n

Workshops to provide insights on best practices in order to help the Arbitrum DAO distribute grant funding for scalable, impactful growth.</p>\n<p>Our invite-only participants have demonstrated great interest in managing their own grant programs, in areas of their expertise, through our application process and our goal is to not only empower their mission, but to also help facilitate the intricacies within the grant funding process.</p>\n<p>For our introductory Planning Grants Workshop, we covered various topics to kick off our thought process behind planning grant programs:</p>\n<p>Planning Grant Workshop Overview section was to go over the high-level goals and details that come with it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rewarding participants for further refining their grant program proposals, claimable at end of ThankARB Season 10</li>\n<li>Attending our Workshops to assure alignment with ThankARB &amp; Arbitrum DAO</li>\n<li>Not guaranteed for future funding - ThankARB is selecting 10 to 15 programs to fund</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We went over our Timeline to give grant program managers an idea of how long we expect these programs to run.</p>\n<p></p><div

Our grants are funded in $ARB so we emphasize the need to plan accordingly</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For our last topic, we focused on scalability. It’s important for our grant program managers to demonstrate scalability with their program. If they received 10x the funding, would they be able to achieve 10x the results or more? We ask our grant program managers to think about the scalability of their programs and consider the potential impact they could make for the Arbitrum DAO as the ecosystem continues to grow.</p>\n<p>We are looking to make drastic improvements within the DAO ecosystem, and in order to do so we intend to focus on winners by scaling their programs as much as they can.</p>\n<p>All in all, we’re extremely grateful for the participation in these meetings as it helps us not only understand the thoughts behind these amazing grant program ideas but to also reflect on potential hurdles and avenues of improvement. The Arbitrum DAO has an endless pool of exceptional talent and we have full intention to harness that talent for the betterment of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We can’t wait to review the refined proposals, select our grantees, and roll out these grant programs to help fund &amp; scale our Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Onward &amp; upward.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/planning-grants-workshops-hosted-by-thank-arb/24535\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/planning-grants-workshops-hosted-by-thank-arb/24535","pubDate":"Thu, 30 May 2024 17:57:51 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-24535"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/planning-grants-workshops-hosted-by-thank-arb/24535.rss","#text":"Planning Grants Workshops - Hosted by Thank ARB"},"filter":false},{"title":"Proposal: The Startup Collective - Ecosystem Growth in Arbitrum.","dc:creator":"scollen","category":"Proposals","description":"<p>This proposal is the work of the team behind <a href=\"https://elixircapital.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Elixir Capital</a> in collaboration with members of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

This proposal establishes the Arbitrum Startup Collective, a comprehensive program designed to accelerate and bring capital to promising early-stage startups building on or migrating to the Arbitrum protocol and its related product suite.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has successfully launched several initiatives to attract new users and liquidity to Arbitrum through initiatives like grant programs for idea-stage and pre-seed startups (e.g RnDAO, PL, etc), and incentive programs (STIP, Backfund, LTIPP) for later-stage players and established protocols.</p>\n<p>Building on this success, the Arbitrum ecosystem is now ready to explore other models (not grant-based) for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling startups beyond early stages: Supporting the growth of ventures that emerge from existing programs.</li>\n<li>Attracting top teams building on Arbitrum: Enticing high-caliber startups, particularly those in the Seed to Series A stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In collaboration with the Arbitrum DAO, the current founders’ community, and the wider stakeholders; our initiative will aim to support and invest in up to 150 high-potential startups at the Seed to Series A stage and across verticals in the Arbitrum ecosystem over a three year period.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivations-2\"></a>Motivations</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>New model for ecosystem development</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the current up-cycle in the industry, there is a tremendous opportunity for growth and innovation. New market cycles bring higher token prices, which historically attract new builders and new users. Data from <a href=\"https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=22411-monthly-active-open-source-developers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Electric capital’s developer report</a> shows that the number of developers grew 3x during the 2021 bull market and grew 10x in the 2017 bull market.</p>\n<p>Ethereum aside, Polygon and Solana are the top two ecosystems which have attracted more developers than any other ecosystem. Both have been amongst the most active in running venture-style ecosystem development programs such as the Polygon Accelerator, the Polygon Venture fund, the Polygon Village initiative, the Solana Ecosystem Fund, Solana Hackers House, and the Solana Super Team initiatives.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Why does Arbitrum need this initiative?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Arbitrum requires strategic investment initiatives to maintain its rapid growth and solidify its position as a leading ecosystem. While Arbitrum has achieved impressive success with a strong user base and Total Value Locked (TVL), competitors like Optimism and Polygon have deployed significantly more capital to fuel their ecosystem growth. Today, there are programs tackling both ends of the start-up growth spectrum in the Arbitrum ecosystem (refer diagram below) but it seems there is a clear gap at the Seed to Series A level.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hWV1uesBBQ3Gj0DEdWuBdbAHLmO.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_449x164.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hWV1uesBBQ3Gj0DEdWuBdbAHLmO\" width=\"449\" height=\"164\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_449x164.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_673x246.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7dcdfe792e8a66b1513da62a3f6d5ce43627e28a_2_898x328.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D6E0E9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Building a successful venture ecosystem cannot rely solely on capital deployed; it is about enabling existing participants, providing structured value creation &amp; support to new participants, and creating hyper-connectivity - that ultimately reinforces a powerful ecosystem growth flywheel.</p>\n<p>Leading startup accelerators like Y Combinator and Techstars demonstrate the power of structured programs. These programs cultivate vibrant communities where startups collaborate, invest in each other, and attract top talent, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth (e.g Paypal “mafia” - the initial group of people who were with PayPal during its early days and that went on to establish influential companies like Tesla, SpaceX, LinkedIn, YouTube, Yelp, and many more).</p>\n<p>The proposed Arbitrum Startup Collective targets strategic investments in up to 150 Arbitrum-focused companies at Seed to Series A stage with a comprehensive support program. This approach stimulates network effects, attracting talent while providing startups with a compelling capital and value creation proposition.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective will activate existing builders and ecosystem participants to serve as mentors and experts, while our team will be responsible for program management, community building across several regions, and founders’ support initiatives. This proposal is a long-term investment that will create lasting value within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>By establishing this Arbitrum Startup Collective now, Arbitrum can continue to solidify its leadership position and propel the network to explosive growth.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What is the expected impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ecosystem funds have historically played a crucial role as growth catalysts for emerging protocols and ecosystems, especially for the growth of developers and decentralized applications (dApps). As a result, new wallets have emerged, contributing to the growth of total value locked (TVL) and ultimately driving growth of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We believe that the Arbitrum Startup Collective will help achieve the following objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funnel capital into the best start-ups building on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Drive adoption of Arbitrum among developers and dApps</li>\n<li>Provide high quality diligence and support to reputable (Web2 &amp; Web3) investors to deploy in Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Geographical diversification and stronger localization in key regions</li>\n<li>Increase the Arbitrum DAO treasury through investments returns</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"initiative-summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#initiative-summary-3\"></a>Initiative Summary</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective aims to supercharge the ecosystem by fueling promising startups, attracting developers and dApps, driving more capital into the ecosystem, and ultimately maximizing returns for the Arbitrum DAO treasury.</p>\n<p>a- Growth stage:</p>\n<p>The initiative is designed to tackle three stages of growth to cover the startup lifecycle and provide optimal impact to the Arbitrum ecosystem through tracks of support and investing:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9cbe08baf60fd2f878c6408aa5db48aef94e4c1d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/mmBD9MCjVmTiet2DPrbmTCXNP8V.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9cbe08baf60fd2f878c6408aa5db48aef94e4c1d.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"mmBD9MCjVmTiet2DPrbmTCXNP8V\" width=\"624\" height=\"363\" role=\"presentation\" data-dominant-color=\"EBECE8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The program is envisioned as a three-year initiative. This timeframe acknowledges the maturity cycle of accelerator models and allows for cross-fertilization between different programs within the Startup Collective (e.g., scout program feeding into scale and follow-on programs).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Scout Program (Pre-Seed Focus): To identify the most promising founders in the ecosystem, we propose to leverage a Scout Network composed of experienced entrepreneurs and angel investors deeply familiar with the Arbitrum ecosystem. These scouts significantly extend the reach by leveraging their networks and industry knowledge to uncover innovative ideas before a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Scouts get access to promising startups through various channels, including inbound, referrals through their network, and industry events. This proactive approach allows us to spot ventures before traditional funding rounds, ensuring we capture the most disruptive and impactful ideas for the Arbitrum ecosystem and serve as a feeder to the Scale Program (described below).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scale Program (Seed to Series A stage): These companies already have a product with early users, or demonstrate early signs of success. Seed funding rounds are typically led by venture capitalists to complete product launches and refine growth models. Alongside a capital investment, the Arbitrum Startup Collective offers a structured program to provide additional support and value creation (details below). This program will go beyond just deploying capital and equip startups with the resources they need to thrive, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mentorship: Connect with experienced builders, advisors and mentors who will provide strategic guidance and industry insights.</li>\n<li>Network Access: Gain access to a network of investors, partners, and potential customers within the Arbitrum ecosystem and beyond.</li>\n<li>Technical Resources: Benefit from workshops, educational programs, and access to technical resources to accelerate product development.</li>\n<li>Community Building: Facilitate connections and collaboration between startups within the program and the broader Arbitrum community.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Follow-on (Series A+): For top performers from within the portfolio, the plan is to double down on winners to support them in later stages and maximize upside. Follow-on investments will be limited to companies coming from the Scout or Scale program described above who are proven to increase activity or adoption of Arbitrum</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>b- Geographical focus:</p>\n<p>The initial focus of this initiative will be on Europe, Middle East, and South Asia to allow us to leverage our existing expertise and connections within this region. Although the program is fully remote and there are no requirements for teams to be located at any specific place, there will be in person events organized during the program to drive more collaboration between the teams.</p>\n<p>c- Sector focus:</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective is not sector specific and would consider startups across various sectors as long as they build on or plan to integrate with Arbitrum technology. However, to avoid any overlap with the RnDAO or the GCP initiative, collaboration tools and gaming will be specifically excluded from the Arbitrum Startup Collective to avoid any overlap.</p>\n<p>Expected Outcome</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Startup Collective is designed to achieve a lasting impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem by fostering a vibrant community of talented developers, entrepreneurs, and users. The key expected outcomes for this initiative include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Innovation: This initiative will act as a catalyst for the success of promising early-stage startups building on Arbitrum. We target up to 150 startups to join or grow in the Arbitrum ecosystem through this initiative. A high percentage of the portfolio companies will achieve significant milestones, generate user activity within the ecosystem, and potentially lead to the launch of groundbreaking startups.</li>\n<li>Network Growth: This initiative will contribute to the creation of a dynamic and engaged Arbitrum ecosystem and we expect the launch of over 10 Orbit chains, fostering a rich and diverse ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) built on Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Financial Returns: This initiative is designed to generate a strong return on investment for the Arbitrum DAO (structured as investments - not grants - with the Arbitrum DAO retaining upside). By strategically investing in high-growth companies and fostering a thriving ecosystem, we aim to deliver exceptional financial returns for the DAO upon the fund’s maturity.</li>\n<li>Attracting Capital: The success of this initiative in fostering innovation and attracting high-caliber startups is expected to generate significant interest from other investors. We anticipate securing co-investment and follow-on capital from these investors - further fueling the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By delivering on these ambitious yet attainable goals, the Arbitrum Startup Collective will propel Arbitrum to the forefront of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"program-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-details-4\"></a>Program Details</h1>\n<p>a- Scout Program</p>\n<p>Scouts are existing members of the Arbitrum DAO or community, experienced entrepreneurs with strong expertise in different domains, and likely already angel investors with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by early-stage founders inside and outside of Web3.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hOLJGGjmqT3gJCvnaxOKrvaDhlQ.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-31 at 18.43.41\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6_2_690x376.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-31 at 18.43.41\" data-base62-sha1=\"hOLJGGjmqT3gJCvnaxOKrvaDhlQ\" width=\"690\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6_2_690x376.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6_2_1035x564.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7ce2272b35644f4b87def5479235fdb0d97d00d6.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E3E5E2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Once elected, Scouts can invest capital into opportunities by following the process below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Submit an investment memo to the Arbitrum Startup Collective team</li>\n<li>The investment team will review if all investment criteria are met, including that capital is directed to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Arbitrum Startup Collective team will conduct expedited due diligence to ensure the capital is being appropriately allocated (e.g. sanctions, background checks, conflict of interest, etc) and other factors that maintain the reputation of the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>The Arbitrum Startup Collective team will review the legal documentation and ensure it is appropriate for such investment (priority will be given to simplicity and using market standard documentation when possible e.g predominantly SAFE, token warrants, and SAFTs as appropriate)</li>\n<li>Capital is deployed directly into the start-up by the Arbitrum Startup Collective investment vehicle</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: Please note that these are structured as investments, not grants. The investments are made through the Arbitrum Startup Collective investment vehicle which will have the Arbitrum DAO as its sole investor. The Arbitrum DAO will therefore retain exposure to the upside from these investments and will receive distributions upon exit.</p>\n<p>The Scouts will be incentivized and compensated for their contribution through an allocation of up to 10% of the upside generated from the investments attributed to them (i.e. if a scout refers a $50,000 investment that is subsequently exited with net proceeds of $500,000; that scout would receive $50,000 compensation).

This agreement will clearly define the scope of work, outlining Elixir Capital’s responsibilities in detail including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Startup identification, application process, and selection</li>\n<li>Cohort management and program delivery, including mentorship, workshops, and events</li>\n<li>Regular reporting and communication with the Arbitrum DAO Oversight Committee</li>\n<li>Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The service agreement will establish clear performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the service provider. Regular reviews will be conducted by the Arbitrum DAO (through the Oversight Committee) to assess performance against these metrics.</p>\n<p>The service provider’s compensation will be structured to incentivize strong performance and alignment with program goals. It is based on a fixed fee basis to cover core program management activities and is paid based on specific milestones.</p>\n<p>In the event of underperformance or non-compliance with the service agreement, the Arbitrum DAO will have the right to terminate the agreement with reasonable notice. A clear process for transitioning program management to a new service provider will be outlined within the agreement.</p>\n<p>Investment Agreement</p>\n<p>A separate investment agreement will govern the management of funds allocated to the Arbitrum Startup Collective. This agreement will establish a framework that ensures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investor Upside: The Arbitrum DAO, as the investor, retains upside generated from the program’s investments.</li>\n<li>Investment Management: Elixir Capital will be accountable for managing the deployed funds effectively, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio oversight, and exit strategies.</li>\n<li>Investor Liability Protection: The investment agreement will be structured to limit the liability of the Arbitrum DAO as the investor. It will function as a legal shield, protecting the DAO from potential liabilities arising from the fund’s activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the investment nature of the program, we will appoint a professional fund administrator (such as NAV Consulting, Formidium, etc) to manage the vehicle and ensure compliance with the investment agreement. This appointment offers several benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliance: The fund administrator ensures adherence to the investment agreement and relevant regulations.</li>\n<li>Transparency: They provide independent oversight and reporting on the investment portfolio.</li>\n<li>Risk Management: Fund administrators mitigate risks associated with fund operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The investment capital will be contributed to the investment vehicle following a capital call schedule which would likely be twice annually to fund program activities and investments. Upon successful exits, the generated returns and distributions will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO, the sole investor in the program. The investment agreement will include clawback provisions that allow the Arbitrum DAO to recoup investment funds if they are not invested within the investment period.</p>\n<p>The investment manager compensation will be structured to incentivize strong performance and alignment with program goals. It is based on a combination of a fixed management fee and a performance-based fee that incentivizes the investment manager to generate strong returns on the invested capital.</p>\n<p>Note: A formal contractual agreement ensures clarity, transparency, and accountability in the program’s execution and delivery.

In the absence of an economic incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-terms-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-3\"></a><strong>Key Terms</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One honest party.</strong> In BoLD, a single party has the capability to protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.</li>\n<li><strong>Assertion.</strong> A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum rollup inbox contract that are ordered by the Sequencer.</li>\n<li><strong>Assertion bond.</strong> Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the submitter to join the validator set by putting up a large bond, in the form of (currently) 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion.</li>\n<li><strong>Proposer.</strong> An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Active proposer.</strong> A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping to advance the chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Service fee.</strong> A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions. The fee is paid for every on-chain assertion posted by the proposer.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenge bond.</strong> The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the big-step and one-step challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"budget-request-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#budget-request-4\"></a><strong>Budget Request</strong></h1>\n<p>This section focuses on the budget request from the ArbitrumDAO treasury alongside the motivation for why the funding is required.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"assertion-and-challenge-bonds-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#assertion-and-challenge-bonds-5\"></a>Assertion and Challenge Bonds</h2>\n<p>We are requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO treasury to cover the bonds required to establish a single honest proposer with the capability to defend the system.</p>\n<p>The requested ETH is a combination of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3600 ETH required to post an assertion bond, and;</li>\n<li>Subsequent 555 ETH + 79 ETH for challenge bonds for one challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation will deposit these funds in the <code>RollupCore.sol</code> contracts on L1 Ethereum for the validator. If the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1\">BoLD AIP</a> passes, then the Arbitrum Foundation’s staked validator will be enabled to immediately act as a proposer for Arbitrum One</p>\n<p><em>Note: the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to be the first active validator, not the ONLY validator. BOLD removes the reliance on a permissioned set of validators, and any interested parties and/or teams can permissionlessly run nodes and validators for Arbitrum chains upon a successful upgrade of the dispute protocol.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"service-fees-for-bold-validators-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#service-fees-for-bold-validators-6\"></a>Service Fees for BOLD Validators</h2>\n<p>All blockchain systems, including Arbitrum, should reward participants who actively work to advance the system.</p>\n<p>In the case of Arbitrum, the DAO will pay a service fee to an active proposer who is helping to advance the system by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet. At the time of writing, the estimated annual income is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH, according to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr\">Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices</a>.</p>\n<p>We must highlight that this payment is a fee and not a reward. In BoLD, a new assertion can be posted every round (1 hour) and only a single fee is paid per round. There can be multiple agents who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1. The proposer whose assertion is accepted by L1 and paid the service fee is called the active proposer for this round. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. Meanwhile, if an entity, say Bob, has posted a successor assertion to one previously made by another entity, Alice, then Bob would be considered by the protocol to be the current active proposer. Alice would no longer be considered by the protocol as the active proposer and once Alice’s assertion is confirmed, then Alice gets her assertion bond refunded.</p>\n<p>We estimate the following service fee per year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Foundation is therefore requesting 500 ETH to support service fee payments for up to 3 years (with a buffer of 68 ETH in case the average Ethereum validator income increases) in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. Moving forward, the DAO may consider allocating a portion of ETH from the ArbitrumDAO governed chains’ sequencer fees to fund the ongoing service fees for active proposers.</p>\n<p>To learn more, please read the section on <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7\">Service Fees in the BOLD AIP</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7\"></a>Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs</h2>\n<p>We are requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain.

Given the financial cost to a dishonest proposer, we are not expecting many challenges to occur. Even so, we should always be prepared for the worst-case scenario and be ready to defend against it.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491\">BoLD whitepaper</a> and theoretical calculations conducted by the Offchain Labs team, honest moves to defend a full challenge will cost honest parties roughly 62,632,000 gas (not including the top-level assertion).</p>\n<p>Per challenge, the L1 gas costs will depend on the gas price at the time of the challenge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>At a 50 gwei/gas price, this equals 3.1316 ETH in L1 gas costs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At a 100 gwei/gas price, this equals 6.2632 ETH in L1 gas costs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At a 500 gwei/gas price, this equals 31.316 ETH in L1 gas costs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assuming one challenge per year, we estimate 93.93 ETH will be required in the worst-case scenario.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"gas-cost-summary-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#gas-cost-summary-11\"></a>Gas Cost Summary</h4>\n<p>Assuming a nominal gas price of 50 gwei/gas during normal operations (i.e. no challenges) and assuming an elevated 500 gwei/gas price during a challenge (i.e. worst-case scenario), to fully reimburse an honest party’s gas costs incurred for posting assertions and for performing honest moves to defend Arbitrum in the event of one challenge per year, the Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 400 ETH for 3 years.</p>\n<p>This includes ~308 ETH to cover the above costs and a ~92 ETH buffer in the event of higher gas prices during normal operations, during a challenge, and/or in the event that there is more than one challenge per year.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"steps-to-implement-timeline-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-timeline-12\"></a>Steps to implement &amp; timeline</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate [this post].</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two separate temperature checks on Snapshot (1 week).</p>\n<p>a. <strong>Bond sentiment.</strong> Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation’s request for 4234 ETH to run the first BOLD validator.<br>\nb. <strong>Operational cost sentiment.</strong> Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer.

Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The ArbitrumDAO reserves the right to revoke the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and return the bonds back to the treasury.

To date, RWAs represent a small percentage of Arbitrum’s builder activity, accounting for 1.1% of grants in 2023. It is critical for Arbitrum to take the lead and future-proof platform growth, especially when competitors like Polygon and Avalanche have made significant strides in tokenizing assets on their platforms.</p>\n<p>As promised, we are sharing the summary notes and resources from our session for those who were unable to attend or want to review! Additionally, we now have a dedicated TG channel for comms and questions on this keep topic (h/t Robin Nagpal).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To join the Arbitrum DAO RWA Group on Telegram, click <a href=\"https://t.me/+H0zCKfluNbliMDVh\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"i-key-highlights-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#i-key-highlights-2\"></a><strong>I.
