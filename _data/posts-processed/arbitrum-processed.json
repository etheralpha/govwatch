The main objective is to address the risk of dependency on a single point of failure presented by the sequencer.</p>\n<p>The proposal focuses on decentralization and empowering users through an open-source approach, enabling other teams to deploy their own versions of the interface. This initiative not only enhances the network’s resilience but also provides users with greater control and confidence in the Arbitrum ecosystem. By enabling direct transaction submission to L1, users can bypass potential issues with the sequencer or any attempts at censorship, thereby ensuring uninterrupted transaction capabilities. This approach also upholds Arbitrum’s trustless security model, reinforcing the integrity of its Rollup technology even during operational challenges.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"arbitrums-forum-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#arbitrums-forum-3\"></a>Arbitrum’s Forum</h2>\n<p>Last February, we submitted a proposal to the Arbitrum Foundation Forum.

As mentioned above, any team should be able to run their own instance of the service, so it’s crucial that everything is clearly explained. We’ll also include a list of URLs for instances set up by others that we have verified as correctly implemented.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"service-maintenance-after-launch-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#service-maintenance-after-launch-12\"></a>Service &amp; Maintenance after Launch</h3>\n<p>We are committed to hosting the site on either Vercel or AWS, ensuring continuous operation 24/7 for a minimum of 24 months. Once we achieve a stable version that has been thoroughly tested, we will also deploy an instance on IPFS to offer a fully decentralized option. While this may not be the most performant choice initially, it will be available for at least these 2 years, with plans to extend indefinitely after evaluating its performance.<br>\nAt WakeUp Labs we will initially refine the website based on user and Arbitrum community feedback, conducting ongoing testing to maintain reliability. Any issues such as downtime or crashes will be promptly addressed by our team for at least the next two years.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"estimated-timeframe-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#estimated-timeframe-13\"></a>Estimated Timeframe</h3>\n<p>Approximately 4.5 months for full implementation, including design phases, followed by 3 months dedicated to post-launch iterations. We will then commit to hosting, monitoring, and addressing any possible errors for 24 months after launch.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusions-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusions-14\"></a>Conclusions.</h2>\n<p>Developing a front-end interface to facilitate force-including transactions during Sequencer downtime is a crucial initiative within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal aims to empower users by ensuring they can execute transactions even when the Sequencer is unavailable. This effort aligns closely with Arbitrum’s objectives of decentralization and bolstering user autonomy.</p>\n<p>To ensure the solution is effective during critical scenarios, it’s essential that other projects can independently deploy their own instances of this service. This is why the project is conceived as open-source from inception, and we are committed to actively supporting teams interested in adopting it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"whats-next-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#whats-next-15\"></a>What’s Next?</h2>\n<p>As we embark on the first phase — Technical Research, POC, Documentation, and Testing — we will keep you updated with all the progress!</p>\n<p>Also, you can check out our general communications thread on this forum to learn more about us and what we’re building on Arbitrum!</p>\n<p>Follow us on<br>\n<img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bird.png?v=12\" title=\":bird:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":bird:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> X (Twitter)<br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wakeuplabs\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/wakeuplabs</a><br>\n<img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12\" title=\":raised_hands:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":raised_hands:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> LinkedIn<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/wakeuplabs\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/wakeuplabs</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wakeup-labs-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/25926\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wakeup-labs-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/25926","pubDate":"Thu, 25 Jul 2024 23:13:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25926"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wakeup-labs-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/25926.rss","#text":"WakeUp Labs: Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime"},"filter":false},{"title":"WakeUp Labs - General Comms Thread Our Journey on Arbitrum","dc:creator":"WakeUpLabs","category":"General","description":"<h2><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tldr-1\"></a>TL,DR.</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wakeuplabs.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">WakeUp Labs</a> is a studio offering advanced development services to EVM-Compatible Chains, DAOs, and businesses.

This version is an updated version, especially making sure that this proposal is understood as a start to have more usage analytics around Orbit chains, and that the future process of data collection and onboarding of chains is streamlined, and constantly iterated on to make the listings cheaper and more affordable/sustainable for upcoming (and potentially smaller, more niche) Orbit chains.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"abstract-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-3\"></a>Abstract</h3>\n<p>We want to increase the transparency into the Orbit stack by aggregating important metrics on a chain level so that users, builders, and DAO members can make better data-driven decisions, including what revenue an Orbit chain generates. This means creating a dedicated Arbitrum Orbit Stack page on <a href=\"http://growthepie.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">growthepie.xyz</a> having 20 chains listed with standardized metrics for each chain and an aggregated fundamental metrics view for the whole stack.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>So far, there is no go-to place that provides an overview of Arbitrum Orbit. Standardized metrics allow a better idea of the performance and outlook of each chain being part of the Arbitrum Orbit. This results in greater transparency for all chains regarding their activity and how the usage of one chain compares to another.</p>\n<p>Users can use this information to gather a quick overview of the Orbit ecosystem. Builders can use the different metrics to better track adoption, and DAO members can make more data-driven decisions on future initiatives (e.g., Orbit retrospective funding based on onchain contribution to the DAO).</p>\n<p>Also, visibility for the overall Arbitrum Orbit stack is increased, and the whole Ethereum ecosystem can see what is going on in the Arbitrum ecosystem - where to be and interact, build, or allocate funding towards. Additionally, for DAO members and delegates, revenue and cost metrics provide future insight into how the Orbit approach should be developed to make it profitable for the DAO as well (includes more transparency into how much Orbit chains are paying to Arbitrum One).</p>\n<p>This proposal is meant as a start for a long-term partnership to provide listing of Orbit chains long-term and on a recurring basis on growthepie. After the listing of the first setup and 20 initial chains, we would like to follow up with another AIP to enable listing of the 21st+ chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-5\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>growthepie is an entirely public goods funded analytics platform for Ethereum scaling solutions. The AIP aligns closely with Arbitrum community’s mission and guiding values. At growthepie, Ethereum alignment is at the core of our existence, ensuring that our efforts contribute to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We aim to enhance transparency, enabling data-driven decisions that are crucial for tracking outcomes and improving strategic decisions. All our code is open-source, allowing anyone to review and verify our metric logic. This openness fosters trust and ensures the integrity of our platform. We prioritize inclusivity by offering our platform and API completely free of charge, ensuring maximum accessibility for all users.</p>\n<p>Our user-focused design philosophy centers on the needs of our diverse audience, making data easy to digest and actionable for all users. We uphold the values of neutrality and openness as we believe in the power of data to increase transparency and objectivity. All information on our platform is freely available, reinforcing our commitment to these principles.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"key-terms-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-6\"></a>Key Terms</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Gas fees paid by chain users</li>\n<li><strong>Onchain contributions to DAO:</strong> Orbit chain revenue contribution to the DAO (exact mechanics and details TBD)</li>\n<li><strong>Fundamentals metrics:</strong> Transaction Count, Active Addresses, Throughput, Stablecoin Market Cap, TVL, Revenue (Fees paid by users), Costs (Settlement/DA), Profit (Revenue – costs), FDV, Market Cap, Transaction Costs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"specifications-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-7\"></a>Specifications</h3>\n<p>growthepie has proven to be a platform for people wanting to understand the overall health, activity, and usage across the Ethereum scaling solutions ecosystem. Arbitrum One was listed as one of the first 5 chains from the beginning. Since then, Arbitrum members have used the platform to compare Arbitrum One with other Layer 2s, and we have provided reliable data and visualizations for Arbitrum’s community. Marketing has also used our charts to provide data-driven insights into the ecosystem and how Arbitrum One is growing, giving it more credibility.</p>\n<p>Building on this, the Arbitrum Orbit should be given a dedicated place on growthepie with 20 chains listed in the beginning. This allows us to provide a mostly complete overview of the whole Arbitrum stack. This proposal is aimed at the start of a longer partnership. Hence, as part of this proposal, we will design and set up the initial pages and backend needed to onboard Orbit chains, aggregate fundamental metrics, and especially revenue metrics for each chain.</p>\n<p>Each Orbit chain – as Arbitrum One and any other chain listed on growthepie – will have their own set of metrics (in the categories activity, value locked, economics, and convenience) and their own single chain page. Additionally, each chain will appear on each fundamental metrics page for which the specific metric is available.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we will introduce a Stack view (new page) that provides a complete overview of the whole stack aggregated. This will be on a dedicated page which will enable users, builders, and DAO members solely interested in the Orbit to go to this place and learn more. See the prototype which includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leading chart that aggregates Layer 2s and/or Layer 3s together showing growth over time</li>\n<li>Table that lists all available Orbit chains on growthepie separated into Layer 2 and Layer 3</li>\n<li>Fundamental metrics section with the aggregated view of all chains combined in the Arbitrum Orbit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This set of views will make it possible to easily get an overview and see the growth of the whole Orbit ecosystem but also to compare certain Orbit chains against each other (or against other Layer 2s from other ecosystems).</p>\n<div class=\"d-image-grid\">\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d9bd5b2468d2fd0131cb55cca9281f3cc06c2a96.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/v4diSuw9iDmrxQ5vgTvHOLIrycu.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"degen-example\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d9bd5b2468d2fd0131cb55cca9281f3cc06c2a96_2_359x500.jpeg\" alt=\"degen-example\" data-base62-sha1=\"v4diSuw9iDmrxQ5vgTvHOLIrycu\" width=\"359\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d9bd5b2468d2fd0131cb55cca9281f3cc06c2a96_2_359x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d9bd5b2468d2fd0131cb55cca9281f3cc06c2a96_2_538x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d9bd5b2468d2fd0131cb55cca9281f3cc06c2a96_2_718x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"2A3132\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b8a746e1b927b8fd0b6aa705bd8bc94a31e06d89.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qlwf6vAX9SZ0ip17cVLvKQxr6YN.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"orbit-example\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b8a746e1b927b8fd0b6aa705bd8bc94a31e06d89_2_368x499.jpeg\" alt=\"orbit-example\" data-base62-sha1=\"qlwf6vAX9SZ0ip17cVLvKQxr6YN\" width=\"368\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b8a746e1b927b8fd0b6aa705bd8bc94a31e06d89_2_368x499.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b8a746e1b927b8fd0b6aa705bd8bc94a31e06d89_2_552x748.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b8a746e1b927b8fd0b6aa705bd8bc94a31e06d89_2_736x998.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"252A27\"></a></div><p></p>\n</div>\n<h3><a name=\"steps-to-implement-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-8\"></a>Steps to Implement</h3>\n<p>Timeframe starting from the date of DAO proposal approval and weeks/months add up to each other.

Unlike other alternative VMs, the Stylus VM is not a replacement for the EVM &amp; is instead purely additive to the EVM. This means that Stylus contracts and EVM contracts are fully interoperable. The two VMs work together to facilitate state transitions, each playing their part in executing their respective bytecode. Support for more memory efficient and safer languages will unlock a new generation of applications that were previously impossible to build on the EVM.</p>\n<p>The Stylus VM and fraud prover were originally developed as a fork of the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro\">Nitro</a> codebase before. The Stylus codebase has since been audited (<a href=\"https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-05-offchain-arbitrumstylus-securityreview.pdf\">Trail of Bits audit report</a>) and merged back into the Nitro codebase:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus: Stylus VM and Fraud Prover</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Merged into the Nitro codebase in: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2242\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield · Pull Request #2242 · OffchainLabs/nitro · GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2425\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Stylus v2 by tsahee · Pull Request #2425 · OffchainLabs/nitro · GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-geth\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-geth</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Merged into Offchain Labs’ fork of Geth in: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/305\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield · Pull Request #305 · OffchainLabs/go-ethereum · GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Merged into the Nitro-contracts codebase in: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/170\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield · Pull Request #170 · OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts · GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stylus contracts can be written using the Stylus SDK, which employs Solidity-equivalent ABIs and storage patterns to ensure cross-language interoperability.

Addition of a new pre-compile, to Arbitrum Nitro, that reduces the costs of verifying the secp256r1 elliptic curve as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md\">RIP-7212</a></h3>\n<p>Passkeys offer a solution that removes the need for a web3 user to personally store a private key for their wallet. Passkeys accomplish this by leveraging WebAuthn, a global standard for passwordless authentication used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and all major web browsers. The private key generated when creating a passkey can be encrypted and can only be decrypted using a specialized hardware module called the Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave ensures a user’s private key can never leave the device, transforming any compatible device into a hardware wallet. Users can authorize transactions with biometric features like Touch ID or Face ID when using passkey-based wallets for key management. These qualities add flexibility and significantly improve UX while maintaining high security.</p>\n<p>Adding support for <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md\">RIP-7212</a> decreases the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve on-chain <a href=\"https://www.alchemy.com/blog/what-is-rip-7212\">by 99%</a> when compared to current implementations, making them more feasible for everyday use and enabling dApp developers and protocols to offer their users improved UX on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Without a precompile, verifying this signature on-chain is extremely expensive. Passkey-based wallets offer a better level of security than a typical EOA and seamless cross-device support. Many wallets, and notably, apps using embedded wallets, have been requesting this feature for over a year.</p>\n<p>The specifications of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md\">RIP-7212</a>, including test cases, can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md\">RIP repository</a>.

Shielded voting encrypts votes during the voting period and decrypts them only after the vote closes, mitigating bandwagon effects, voter apathy, and last-minute strategic voting. A Snapshot vote to gauge the DAO’s sentiment will be posted on <strong>Thursday, August 8th</strong>. Please note, this is an actual temperature check, just to gauge the DAO’s opinion on the subject.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#background-2\"></a>Background</h2>\n<p>Shutter’s shielded voting differs slightly from a traditional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">secret ballot</a> where voter’s identity and selection are kept anonymous. In this case, votes are encrypted during the voting period and are decrypted only after the vote closes. Put more simply, during the voting process, a voter’s position is private, and after the vote, positions are made public. You can see who voted, but not their choice or the total VP per option, until the poll has closed (to clarify any confusion please see the demo linked below). Shutter’s shielded voting on Snapshot has been live for over 2 years now and additional details about the implementation can be found on their <a href=\"https://blog.shutter.network/announcing-shutter-governance-shielded-voting-for-daos/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">blog</a>. A live demo of shielded voting can be found on <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/pistachiodao.eth/proposal/0xa5077ef17097b1d59304b110337bd1c7ce98d95d3ff81d138c3886a80074b4d9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a>.</p>\n<p>Other DAOs have run experiments with shielded voting in the past. Results from a 2-month trail period in Aave DAO can be found <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-private-voting-for-aave-governance-2-month-trial/12730/31\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. It is important to note that the majority of Aave DAO’s proposals are related to protocols parameters, which require more specific knowledge sets on risk &amp; economics. Therefore, it’s not immediately clear how directly the results from Aave DAO can be compared to Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>In the 19th century, most western democracies transitioned from public to private voting methods in elections primarily to reduce voter coercion. While voter coercion is not a widespread issue in the onchain governance space, public votes are susceptible to a few other negative phenomenons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bandwagon Effect:</strong> Voters without a strong opinion tend to go with the current majority opinion. With shielded voting, no one can see how the vote is progressing, thus preventing delegates from being persuaded simply by popular choice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Voter Apathy:</strong> On the flipside, when those in a minority opinion see that their vote no longer impacts the results of either an election or decisions, they may choose not to vote at all. This can be due to feelings that their vote doesn’t matter or that strategically it is not worth the social capital to publicly dissent against the majority.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>11th Hour Voting:</strong> With public voting there is an inherent information mismatch, as the last voter has much more available information to act on than the first voter. Currently, there is a strong incentive to wait until the last possible minute to vote. In some instances this is benevolent behavior as large delegates may not want to indirectly create a bandwagon effect, but other times it can be seen as borderline misbehavior when a late vote is used to strategically create an outcome.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To clarify, we are not arguing that Arbitrum DAO is currently suffering from these effects, but they are each possible with the current public system. There are also downsides to private voting that we’d like to highlight:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall participation may go down if smaller delegates feel like their positions are no longer impactful, as public voting gives those delegates a chance to strongly voice their opinions by voting early.</li>\n<li>Politically savvy parties who have the ability or connections to coordinate now have an even bigger advantage.</li>\n<li>Those who choose to publicly signal their positions gain an advantage over a silent opposition, as some delegate may hold a firm position on silence until the vote concludes.</li>\n<li>Delegates that know how the votes are falling due to backdoor channels can potentially then use residual votes strategically. With public voting methods, this is something that most everyone can do with less effort and connections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general though, Shutter’s shielded voting allows Arbitrum DAO to remain consistent with practice in liberal democracies that votes taken by elected officials (delegates in this case) are publicized so that citizens can judge voting records. Since it addresses many of the aforementioned concerns with public voting methods, Entropy felt it was a worthwhile conversation to bring to the DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-4\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>Given there are some advantages in certain scenarios to private votes for temperature checks, Entropy Advisors is kickstarting this conversation by posing the following question:</p>\n<p><strong>Should Arbitrum DAO default to using shielded voting for Snapshot votes?</strong></p>\n<p>There will be 4 Voting Choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For all Snapshot Votes</li>\n<li>For Elections Only</li>\n<li>Against</li>\n<li>Abstain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is our recommendation that proposal authors still be granted the ability to include reasoning for if a vote should be public instead of shielded. If properly justified, we see no reason to force all Snapshot votes to be shielded (at the DAO’s discretion).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-5\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<p>A Snapshot poll will be posted on <strong>August 8th</strong> to gauge the DAO’s overall sentiment and allow for ample conversation beforehand.</p>\n<p>Additional proposals to follow will include temperature checks for COI policy, delegate code of conduct, and other ideas to improve the DAO’s operational processes. If the vote passes, shielded voting will be incorporated along with the other aforementioned ideas that pass a temp check into a larger proposal. This proposal will look to codify all of the DAO’s new processes into a socially enforceable proposal. After a trial period of the more grandiose unified proposal around DAO Operations, we hope to eventually implement the ideas that have worked best into the Constitution.</p>\n<p>It is important to note, that delegates are already free to post shielded votes. In the case that shielded voting is favored by the DAO, more shielded votes are encouraged while this larger proposal is being worked on.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"cost-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#cost-6\"></a>Cost</h2>\n<p>There is no cost to the DAO as shielded voting is already available to all DAOs on Snapshot.</p>\n            <p><small>9 posts - 8 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-default-to-using-shielded-voting-for-snapshot-votes/25884\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-default-to-using-shielded-voting-for-snapshot-votes/25884","pubDate":"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 16:17:04 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25884"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-default-to-using-shielded-voting-for-snapshot-votes/25884.rss","#text":"Should the DAO Default to using Shielded Voting for Snapshot Votes?"},"filter":false},{"title":"[Project] Delegate Vaults - A new Open Dollar Protocol feature that allows ARB holders to borrow against their delegated tokens","dc:creator":"cupojoseph","category":"General","description":"<h1><a name=\"delegate-vaults-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#delegate-vaults-1\"></a>Delegate Vaults</h1>\n<p>Lending vaults which delegate governance tokens to your favorite DAO contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"tldr-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tldr-2\"></a>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>For ARB, and other gov tokens, users have to choose between holding tokens in their wallet for governance OR depositing in defi to use the tokens in the economic network that makes them valuable.

Then their supporters can create their own vaults (CDPs) and deposit their ARB tokens. The tokens have their voting power automatically delegated at the time of deposit. Depositors can also borrow the OD stablecoin against their deposited ARB as they would a standard vault on our platform, to swap and use in the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>During this initial rollout phase we are creating Delegate Vaults for delegates who register on our form, but in the future we plan for the creation of these to be permissionless.</p>\n<p>For the technical implementation of Delegate Vaults check out our <a href=\"https://github.com/open-dollar/od-contracts/blob/dev/src/contracts/factories/CollateralJoinDelegatableChild.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.

The dashboard aims to track voting behavior, safeguard against potential governance attacks, and measure the success of initiatives like Redelegation Week. We are seeking comments and support from the Arbitrum community to develop this analytic dashboard.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum community needs a robust, user-friendly tool to simplify the understanding of complex governance dynamics, track the effectiveness of initiatives, and ensure transparency and accountability. This dashboard will foster inclusive, data-driven decision-making, enhancing community governance effectiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>Differentiation from Existing Solutions:</strong></p>\n<p>Our Arbitrum Governance Analytics Dashboard aims to fill the gaps in existing platforms by providing more detailed metrics for enhanced understanding and transparency:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Concentration of Voting Power Metrics</strong>: Our dashboard sheds light on the distribution of voting power among small and large holders, their engagement in delegation, and the source of delegates’ voting power. It identifies potential centralization of power and offers insights into each delegate’s influence.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Proposal Metrics</strong>: We offer a detailed view of proposal activities, including the ratio of unique proposers to total proposals and the distribution by type. We classify proposal results as contentious, generally accepted, or normal to help stakeholders understand voting dynamics.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Participation Metrics</strong>: Our focus is on delivering granular metrics on the participation of small and large holders. This comprehensive analysis identifies underrepresented groups and informs strategies for more balanced and inclusive participation.</p>\n<p>Our dashboard is an analytical tool designed to provide a comprehensive view of Arbitrum’s governance process, highlighting underrepresented holders or delegates and the overall power structure. We are committed to iterative development, refining our dashboard based on community feedback to ensure it remains valuable and relevant for all stakeholders.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>This proposal aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission and guiding values by enhancing transparency, promoting data-driven decision-making, and supporting the effectiveness of governance processes. By providing near real-time monitoring and detailed analytics, the dashboard will help the community make informed decisions and maintain a secure governance framework.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"example-uses-of-the-dashboard-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#example-uses-of-the-dashboard-4\"></a>Example Uses of the Dashboard</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Redelegation Week Success Tracking</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To ensure the success of the Redelegation Week program, our dashboard will monitor delegate change in their voting power and track the overall votable supply.This user-friendly interface will display the number of delegates joining and the increase in delegations, providing clear insights into the program’s success.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Optimizing Voting Schedule</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our dashboard will help optimize the voting schedule by identifying periods when delegates are most active. By aligning voting schedules with peak voting activity, we can support the predictability proposal from Entropy, adjusting dates based on these insights to enhance participation and predictability.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Safeguarding from Potential Governance Attacks</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To safeguard against potential governance attacks, our dashboard will help monitor unusual delegation behavior, such as sudden changes in delegate voting power into their respective delegate’s voting activity for certain proposals, helping to maintain a secure and robust governance framework.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Supporting Tools for Current and Future Delegate Incentive Programs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our dashboard will complement the auditing of the Delegate Incentive program’s results. By providing comprehensive analytics and near real-time delegate participation tracking, it ensures transparency and accountability, allowing for accurate assessment and evaluation of the program’s effectiveness.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h3>\n<p>The ArbitrumDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard will be developed by Curia Lab, leveraging our extensive expertise in DAO governance and data analysis.

The <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-to-backfund-successful-stip-proposals-savvy-dao-final/19046\">STIP Backfund proposal</a> was introduced to fund all the STIP applications that were approved but were not funded because the budget ran out. The distribution for STIP and Backfund incentives was extended to March 2024, while the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223\">Long Term Incentives Pilot Program (LTIPP)</a> was introduced in December 2023 and was poised to run from January 2024 to April 2024. Lastly, we had the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353\">STIP-Bridge</a> proposal that was meant to mitigate the ‘unfair’ advantage that protocols distributing incentives from LTIPP would have over those distributing incentives from STIP &amp; Backfund after the latter programs had expired.</p>\n<p>Anyone who followed the discussions around the different proposals and programs is familiar with the fact that time constraints played a significant role in why we didn’t stop to analyze the data collected and iterate based on that. We needed to maintain momentum and remain competitive with other L2s, especially while the market was overall bullish.</p>\n<p>Things have changed over the past few months, and the need for an incentive program that accounts for all the data that we have collected through the past programs has become apparent. Our proposal is a social agreement (we will post a temperature check vote on Snapshot but there will be no on-chain proposal) to use the 3 months following the conclusion of LTIPP and STIP Bridge explicitly to reflect on the learnings, to design &amp; refine a program based on them, as well as on the feedback of key stakeholders.</p>\n<p>We know incentives are a vital part of protocol and ecosystem growth in crypto, and we want to help create a perpetual program that leverages incentives in the most efficient way to create the biggest positive impact on the protocols receiving them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>There are already hundreds of data points to review, analyze, and ultimately distill into actionable insights on what works and what doesn’t in terms of incentives.

We do commit, however, to remaining active in the working group and helping drive the discussion forward.</p>\n<p>Once the working group has been formed, it should regularly meet and work towards designing an incentive program that accounts for as many of the insights we’ve gathered as possible without sacrificing operational efficiency and introducing too many complicated and unnecessary structures.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-6\"></a>Steps to implement</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>This RFC collects feedback and goes to Snapshot.</li>\n<li>The proposal passes Snapshot successfully.</li>\n<li>We ‘revive’ the incentives working group and invite all relevant stakeholders to participate.</li>\n<li>We collectively start designing and refining a long-term incentives program based on all the data we’ve gathered.</li>\n<li>On September 17th, the 3-month incentives break period begins.</li>\n<li>Ideally, by the conclusion of the 3-months break, we will be able to transform the design into an actionable program that can be submitted to the DAO as a proposal.</li>\n<li>[Optional] If 6 doesn’t happen from the working group itself, then we should at least create an overview of principles any future incentive program must take into account in order to be considered by the DAO.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"timeline-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-7\"></a>Timeline</h3>\n<p>The proposed timeline for the incentives detox is 3 months.

If the DAO decides to stake, we recommend gradual investment into a regularly-rebalanced, diversified portfolio of LSTs actively managed in a DAO Treasury Management Vault to minimize trust and mitigate centralization while enabling adaptability to changing risk tolerance and market conditions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"staking-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#staking-overview-2\"></a>Staking Overview</h2>\n<p>Staking ETH is part of the proof-of-stake process for Ethereum mainnet. Stakers are allowed to propose/validate specific, new blocks and attest to a correct path through the block tree building a canonical block chain as it goes. If a staker does not attest to a block at the right time they will lose part of their staked funds. Doing everything correctly currently gains stakers about 3% of their stake per year, making staking <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&amp;field_tdr_date_value_month=202406\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">yield less than US treasuries</a> but more attractive than just holding ETH in a wallet.</p>\n<p>Staking, however, does have some interesting systemic concerns. For example, an entity that controls 33% of all staked ETH can delay finality which some have compared to holding finality hostage. An entity that controls 50% can begin to manipulate block chain fork choice and censor a small amount of blocks. An entity that controls 66% cannot forge transactions but otherwise completely controls what transactions occur on the network. They can censor and reorder transactions at will (including even halting finality). This allows them to dictate the rules of the mempool and have a powerful voice for their future vision of the network. Lido (discussed below) has <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">flirted with the 33% threshold</a> in the past and there are serious concerns that centralized exchanges could amass a concerning amount as well. The concentration of ETH is something that should be monitored regularly by the community. The worst-case scenario is that individual entities would be incentivized to create a cartel and reach the larger, more powerful thresholds that no one member of the cartel can reach on their own. Users aware of this possibility can counteract it by diversifying what entities they stake with. Self-staking would be one way to implement such a strategy and would contribute to the decentralization of the network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"staking-options-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#staking-options-3\"></a>Staking Options</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"self-staking-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#self-staking-4\"></a>Self-Staking</h3>\n<p>Self-staking is when users stake their own ETH by running their own validator node. This allows users to have full control over their funds so that they are able to withdraw their stake when and where they choose while also contributing to the decentralization of the network. The tradeoff for more control, though, is more responsibility. Should a user’s hardware go offline and the node not be present when they are required, they will be penalized the rewards amount they would have made. Worse, if a node makes a serious mistake (like proposing two different blocks) then they will lose a significant portion of their staked amount. The Ethereum Foundation documents the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">necessary validator software for a node</a> so getting started should be quite easy.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-5\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Running a node requires mitigations of the operational risks</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hardware Failure</strong>: hardware failing would create downtime for the node and penalties\n<ul>\n<li>What redundancy solutions are in place?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>DDoS attacks</strong>: the node being down could cost you penalties\n<ul>\n<li>Are you implementing methods to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Node Software Bugs</strong>: The software running the node could have bugs causing the node to have bad behavior and be penalized. The worst case scenario can occur when a <a href=\"https://clientdiversity.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">super majority of all clients</a> run the same node software implementation. A bug in this case could mean all these nodes reaching finality on incorrect blocks and getting slashed on the chain that did not encounter the bug.\n<ul>\n<li>What execution client is running? consensus client? Are they part of a super majority of clients being run?</li>\n<li>What will the software be running on? Is it reliable?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Web2 Attack vectors</strong>: A node machine connected to the internet could receive malware. Worst case scenario is the heist of the node’s private keys. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aP9f_1v9Ulc?t=1740\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vitalik cited this as the reason for him not staking his entire ETH amount</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>Are you following good security practices?</li>\n<li>Who has access to the machine and what powers do they have?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mitigation of these risks usually requires utilizing battle-tested <a href=\"https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">resources and practices</a>. The good news is that spinning up a node and a secure plan for its operation can take place on the <a href=\"https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Holesky testnet</a>. Users should spend time assessing their node setup and effectiveness on this testnet prior to moving to mainnet.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"staking-as-a-service-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#staking-as-a-service-6\"></a>Staking As A Service</h3>\n<p>Staking-as-a-service (<strong>SaaS</strong> or sometimes <strong>StaaS</strong>) allows users to outsource the running of the validator node to a hired operator. There are two large distinctions here: custodial and non-custodial. Custodial SaaS means delivering complete control of your funds to an entity who promises to stake and reward in a certain way but users have no control over their funds, the entity’s behavior, and the regulatory regime of the entity. Examples of this are centralized exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/features/staking-coins\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kraken</a>. Not only can the exchange’s regulatory regime change haphazardly and without warning, but the exchange itself also has its own security practices which may or may not be disclosed or correct and many numerous exchanges have lost user funds.</p>\n<p>Non-custodial Saas includes services like <a href=\"https://www.kiln.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kiln</a> and <a href=\"https://stake.fish/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stakefish</a>. Users deposit their ETH with the provider who then runs the node for them. The node will have its own signing keys and allows the user to have their own, private fund keys which allow them to move funds in and out of the node. In this way, users will have more control over their funds but as determined by the staking provider.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-7\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Utilizing a provider requires trust and verifying their system’s behavior. Vetting a SaaS provider means determining how much of their operation is programmatic and transparent and also measuring their operational history against their operational risk management practices.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency Allows Trust</strong>: black-box SaaS providers have no ability to convince users of their practices and guarantees.\n<ul>\n<li>What parts of the system are open source? audited? bug bounties?</li>\n<li>How are critical components like keys and funds handled?</li>\n<li>What fees do they charge? How is this verifiable?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Best Practices Are Best</strong>: providers that have plans for mitigating the operational issues above demonstrate competence. Look for providers that are open and proactive at describing the risks within their systems and how they handle them.\n<ul>\n<li>How long has the provider been operating?</li>\n<li>How much have they experienced penalties over their operation? What for? Have they ever been slashed?</li>\n<li>Do they describe mitigations to the operational risks described above?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Keep Things Permissionless</strong>: if a system is permissionless to enter and exit, then malicious operators and regulatory regimes cannot interfere with user funds.\n<ul>\n<li>Is it permissionless to join?</li>\n<li>Is there a regulatory regime that affects the provider? Does it require Know-Your-Customer information to join?</li>\n<li>What keys are required to be handed over? Are there separate keys for signing and moving funds?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Good vetting goes a long way but ultimately SaaS requires trust. Diversification among many different, qualified providers could protect a user from concentrated bad effects if there are enough trusted providers to be found.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pooled-staking-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pooled-staking-8\"></a>Pooled Staking</h3>\n<p>Pooled staking is when users deposit their funds together for a node operator to utilize and share staking rewards. Pools that are largely managed on-chain are the most common and provide smart contracts for users to manage their participation. Less common are SaaS-like pools where fund management and rewards are handled off-chain to some degree. By far the most common on-chain solution is for pools to provide ERC20-compliant liquid staking tokens (LSTs) for user deposits. This provides a unique opportunity for users. First, it’s incredibly convenient. A simple deposit is often enough to begin. And second, these pools allow users to stake but then re-deploy their LSTs to other financial purposes. In this way, users can stake and then gain further returns on their capital. Posting these tokens as collateral for more ETH and then repeating the staking process is not uncommon and allows users to create leveraged, staked positions but exposes them to the risks of market prices moving drastically against them and swallowing their initial staking capital. Examples of staking pools include <a href=\"https://rocketpool.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Rocket Pool</a> and of course <a href=\"https://lido.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido</a> which is the single largest staked ETH holder.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-9\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Staking pools have similar risks to SaaS providers but must also handle commingled funds across possibly multiple node operators. As mentioned above, Lido is the giant in this space and its operation is handled by the <a href=\"https://lido.fi/governance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido DAO</a>. So responsible users of the protocol should keep themselves apprised of the DAO’s initiatives and votes. Also, the systemic concerns begin appearing here as well. <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido has been criticized</a> for not doing enough to counter its <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x10abedcc563b66b1adee60825e78c387105110fa4a1e7354ab57bc9cc1e675c2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">profit-seeking motivation</a> and the power of the market incentives for cartel-like behavior cannot be dismissed. Lastly and perhaps most difficult to measure, the ability of users to easily create large leveraged positions could create a catastrophic financial contagion scenario in the face of a large transaction or price movement. For example, June 2022’s stEth depeg was the catalyst for the bankruptcy of Celsius, Voyager, and Three Arrows Capital.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Systemic Risks</strong>: Users should be cognizant of the health of the network and play a responsible part. Diversification among different pools can help mitigate centralization risks.\n<ul>\n<li>How much staked ETH does the pool own?</li>\n<li>How many node operators does it employ? How are these node operators chosen? Are there policies in place to limit incentives for collusion?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Market Risks</strong>: Liquid staking tokens allow users the opportunity to re-deploy their capital but that means they’re subject to the market moving against them.\n<ul>\n<li>Does it provide a liquid staking token? Does it swap for ETH one for one or by an oracle?</li>\n<li>How well does the LST price track the price of ETH through time? What is its market history? Are there other market factors that can be seen to influence the price of the LST? Has it ever depegged?</li>\n<li>What financial analyses are available to assess the financial status and risks of the LST? of its penetration into other markets? of its use in leveraged positions?</li>\n<li>Will you be re-investing your LSTs and putting your ETH stake at risk?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pool-specific Operational Risks</strong>: DAOs (malicious or not) could enact bad upgrades, switch infrastructures, or mandate new policies within an ecosystem that was assumed to behave a different way by users. Commingling of funds also presents a new difficult task with its own risks.\n<ul>\n<li>What components are on-chain and off-chain? How are they controlled? What is the governance structure?</li>\n<li>Is there an operating DAO? Is it dominated by a few actors? What are its goals, initiatives, and vote history? Has it defined a philosophy toward its role and services?</li>\n<li>How do funds enter and exit the pool? How are they then staked and unstaked?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"restaking-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#restaking-10\"></a>Restaking</h3>\n<p>In addition to Ethereum’s proof of stake process, there are other processes called Actively Validated Services (AVSs) which also require staked assets to operate. <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/restaking-101-what-are-restaking-and-liquid-restaking/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Restaking</a> is the practice of using ETH or liquid staking tokens to stake on AVSs. They can be oracles, bridges, cryptography schemes, etc. An example of a restaking protocol is <a href=\"https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Eigenlayer</a> and examples of AVSs are <a href=\"https://www.lagrange.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lagrange</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gasp.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gasp</a>. Usually, restaking providers give ERC20-compliant liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) for deposits and these have similar risks to LSTs in the market. This is a relatively newer service and does have slightly higher returns than the above options but at higher risk of losing funds due to the added complexity of running these services. These are much more complicated than liquid staking pools and are utilized by many to lever up a position and get the highest possible return from a staking-based strategy. Leverage among LRTs, like leverage of LSTs, complicates markets in ways that are difficult to quantify and investigate.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-11\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Restaking has all the complexity of liquid staking pools and then more. Restaking’s complexity and the less-developed markets for their tokens create serious risks that may not be worth it for an investor like Arbitrum DAO where safety of the funds is prioritized.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"considerations-for-the-dao-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#considerations-for-the-dao-12\"></a>Considerations for the DAO</h2>\n<p>All of the above describe staking risks but not their prevalence. As staking operations and markets become more mature, these risks become less and less likely. So how should the DAO proceed?</p>\n<h3><a name=\"determining-a-strategy-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#determining-a-strategy-13\"></a>Determining a Strategy</h3>\n<p>In the future, when issues arise and theses no longer hold true, having a written-down investment plan helps justify the path taken and determine what will need to be done next. The DAO should commit to defining:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What their staking and investment goals are</li>\n<li>What is the timeframe of their staking/investing</li>\n<li>Of the risks described above, what are they willing to take on and how much</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we’ve seen from discussions, the staking goals of the DAO appear to be to protect against ETH inflation, to generate revenue from the ETH reserves they hold, and to do all of this as safely as possible. Whether the DAO has specific, future liabilities they are working towards, we are not aware but these should be part of the investment plan if they exist. The time frame appears to be indefinite, i.e. it seems that this may be a permanent use of the ETH reserves. As for risks, the DAO should determine what risks it likes and what it doesn’t.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"risk-assessment-and-diversification-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#risk-assessment-and-diversification-14\"></a>Risk Assessment and Diversification</h3>\n<p>Let’s start a risk assessment by stating that individual staking may be operationally infeasible for a DAO to run. Multi-sigs, payment agreements, and all sorts of logistics can be set up, but the DAO would ultimately have to trust someone to handle the hardware, software, and funds correctly. So all the set up work is effectively the same as staking via with a SaaS provider but with extra, time-intensive steps to begin. This means that there is no option where the DAO stakes without trusting <em>someone</em>. Put another way, to stake the DAO will have to reasonably trust another party with their funds.</p>\n<p>We also do not go into much detail about Restaking and risks and leave it to the DAO to make that determination if they so choose. LRTs are easier to depeg and markets are harder to analyze therefore we’d recommend the DAO consider LSTs and build experience in these services before considering LRTs.</p>\n<p>This leaves SaaS and Staking Pools. From an operational risk and security perspective, there are SaaS providers and Staking Pools with histories of security and good practices. Each will need to be vetted as described above but the general difference between the two are the market forces that act on pools’ liquid staking tokens. Whether to accept market risks is for the DAO to decide. But having worked in the DeFi space, we see that good investment practice is to document the LST’s market forces, the possible blind spots, the market history, have a plan of action that is ready and easy to implement in case certain conditions arise, visit the assumptions and theses of the plan regularly, and to change the plan if the DAOs understanding of things changes.</p>\n<p>To protect itself from catastrophic, operational failure, OpenZeppelin will vet the security and posture of the different options the DAO considers. The DAO could also split its staked ETH across different options, limiting the max amount they can lose in the worst case scenario. The DAO can also consider slowly staking its ETH over time as it grows comfortable with the different options and strategy as a whole.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"strategy-execution-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#strategy-execution-15\"></a>Strategy Execution</h3>\n<p>A DAO treasury management protocol like <a href=\"https://docs.aera.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aera</a> can be used for securing a diverse portfolio of assets, not limited to the recommended LSTs, with programmatically constrained active management.  A solution like this allows the DAO to remain in control of treasury funds and respond to market conditions faster than a governance vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"links-and-references-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#links-and-references-16\"></a>Links and References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2982\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2982</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/staking/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ethereum.org/en/staking/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.md</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guides\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guides</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4840805\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4840805</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/restaking-101-what-are-restaking-and-liquid-restaking/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.coindesk.com/learn/restaking-101-what-are-restaking-and-liquid-restaking/</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/eth-staking-options-and-risks-for-the-dao/25762\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/eth-staking-options-and-risks-for-the-dao/25762","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:36:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25762"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/eth-staking-options-and-risks-for-the-dao/25762.rss","#text":"ETH Staking Options and Risks for the DAO"},"filter":false},{"title":"Event Horizon Franchiser Contract Audit","dc:creator":"openzeppelin","category":"Security Member","description":"<h2><a name=\"audit-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#audit-summary-1\"></a>Audit Summary</h2>\n<p>Type:   Governance</p>\n<p>Timeline:   From 2024-07-01 To 2024-07-05</p>\n<p>Languages:   Solidity</p>\n<p>Total Issues:   6 (1 resolved)</p>\n<p>Notes &amp; Additional Information:   6 (1 resolved)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"scope-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#scope-2\"></a>Scope</h2>\n<p>We audited the <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">HVAX/arbfranchiser repository</a> at <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser/tree/8caba3d84bb53d1695bfefcf1a99476ef892333e\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commit 8caba3d</a>.</p>\n<p>In scope were the following files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">src\n├── FranchiserFactory.sol\n├── Franchiser.sol\n├── FranchiserLens.sol\n├── base\n│   └── FranchiserImmutableState.sol\n└── interfaces\n    ├── IVotingToken.sol\n    ├── IFranchiserLens.sol\n    ├── IFranchiserImmutableState.sol\n    ├── Franchiser\n    │   ├── IFranchiser.sol\n    │   ├── IFranchiserErrors.sol\n    │   └── IFranchiserEvents.sol\n    └── FranchiserFactory\n        ├── IFranchiserFactory.sol\n        └── IFranchiserFactoryErrors.sol\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The audit only reviewed the smart contract components intended to be deployed on-chain.

This is an EOA that the <a href=\"https://eventhorizon.vote/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Event Horizon (EH) organization</a> will use to represent the voters from their platform. ARB users can only delegate their entire voting power to another address. So, in order to delegate a specific amount, a contract has been created that will have the amount transferred to it and then delegate its voting power to EH.</p>\n<p>The contract that EH provided to do this is a <a href=\"https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fork of a contract that was developed for Uniswap</a>. It was privately audited by Trail of Bits and has a lot of functionality beyond the minimum needs of the ARB DAO. The top-level contract which the DAO will interact with is the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract. It is built to allow anyone to delegate their <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/05f218fb6617932e56bf5388c3b389c3028a7b73/contracts/governance/utils/IVotes.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20 voting token</a>, like ARB, to a delegatee. It does this by creating a <code>Franchiser</code> contract underneath that would mark the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> as the owner, hold the $ARB tokens from the caller, and call <code>delegate</code> on the token to transfer the voting power to the specified user (e.g., the EH EOA).</p>\n<p>When the DAO is ready to take back the funds, a call to <code>recall</code> will pull the tokens out of the <code>Franchiser</code> and return them. There are added methods to batch delegation and recalling which we do not anticipate the DAO will need in this specific case but could use if more delegations of this sort arise. The <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract will create a <code>Franchiser</code> contract as needed for each unique delegator/delegatee pair, while each <code>Franchiser</code> is set up as a <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Clones\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">minimal proxy</a> of a Franchiser implementation contract.</p>\n<p>Each <code>Franchiser</code> contract has to ability for the delegatee to subdelegate their delegated tokens to further subdelegatees. This creates a tree of <code>Franchise</code> contracts with the original delegator/delegatee Franchise contract at the head, each subdelegation from a delegatee at each child node, and the tokens being transferred down the tree to imbue voting power. The original delegatee can sub-delegate up to eight times with each of these sub-delegating up to four, then two, then one. Counting the maximum possible nodes in each level of the tree totals to <code>(1) + (8) + (8 * 4) + (8 * 4 * 2) + (8 * 4 * 2) = 169</code> nodes. At each Franchiser contract in this tree, the delegatee can unsubdelegate and return all of the funds transferred down the tree to their own contract and restore their full voting power delegation. The <code>recall</code> method mentioned above does the same thing but returns all tokens from the tree to the original delegator.</p>\n<p>The scope also includes an optional <code>FranchiserLens</code> contract which contains <code>view</code> functions to get data from the Franchiser tree in flat formats. It is not necessary for the other contracts in scope but would give the DAO easy visibility into their delegation and any further subdeldegations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-model-and-trust-assumptions-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#security-model-and-trust-assumptions-4\"></a>Security Model and Trust Assumptions</h2>\n<p>This code relies on the <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenZeppelin Contracts library</a> for cloning, checking for code size, and for set operations.

If the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract is to be used solely for this one EH delegation, it is possible to change the <code>INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES</code> to one and make further subdelegations by EH impossible. This would ensure that they do not have the ability to further subdelegate to another actor who is not in the proposal but would make vote splitting by subdelegation impossible by EH (at least until <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387\">fractional voting is brought to the governor</a>).</p>\n<p>Of course, by delegating in the first place, the DAO is already trusting EH to behave as promised. Thus, further subdelegations being used maliciously to vote in other ways appears to be a minor risk that is mitigated by the ability to revoke the funds. However, revoking is a slow process that would require a vote to pass as the L2 Governor would be the original delegator. A way around it would be to transfer the funds directly to the security council and entrust them to create the subdelegation from the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract. We are not aware, however, of a precedent or authority for the council to behave this way.</p>\n<p>Possible ways to improve the code and tailor it specifically to Arbitrum’s needs would be to give the non-emergency security council the ability to recall the funds. This can be done by allowing the council to be specified at initial delegation and adding an ability for them to call the <code>recall</code> function. However, even then, a call to <code>recall</code> (even <code>unSubDelegate</code>) could be front-run to get in a last vote before losing voting power. A fix for this could be to add some sort of authorization method for the delegatee to vote only on approved votes, but this seems overly protective and operationally taxing to implement. No matter what the community chooses or how the contract iterates, we will review any on-chain proposal for construction/delegation and opine on its safety and features.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Resolved in <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser/blob/101d01da9b6ca33bf3e9ad1bf12841fc96e5ab8a/src/FranchiserFactory.sol#L18\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commit 101d01d</a>.</em></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-12\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This audit covered the Franchiser contracts provided by Event Horizon. They will allow the Arbitrum DAO to transfer a token through the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> to a <code>Franchiser</code> contract which will delegate its voting power to Event Horizon, allowing them to vote on proposals. The <code>Franchiser</code> contract, as audited, allows Event Horizon to further subdelegate their tokens. If the DAO is not interested in using this contract for further grants, we recommend the DAO remove this subdelegation ability from the contracts by setting the <code>INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES</code> constant to one.</p>\n<p>We found no security issues with the contracts and our notes contain only recommendations for coding practices.

This is an EOA that the <a href=\"https://eventhorizon.vote/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Event Horizon (EH) organization</a> will use to represent the voters from their platform. ARB users can only delegate their entire voting power to another address. So, in order to delegate a specific amount, a contract has been created that will have the amount transferred to it and then delegate its voting power to EH.</p>\n<p>The contract that EH provided to do this is a <a href=\"https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fork of a contract that was developed for Uniswap</a>. It was privately audited by Trail of Bits and has a lot of functionality beyond the minimum needs of the ARB DAO. The top-level contract which the DAO will interact with is the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract. It is built to allow anyone to delegate their <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/05f218fb6617932e56bf5388c3b389c3028a7b73/contracts/governance/utils/IVotes.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20 voting token</a>, like ARB, to a delegatee. It does this by creating a <code>Franchiser</code> contract underneath that would mark the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> as the owner, hold the $ARB tokens from the caller, and call <code>delegate</code> on the token to transfer the voting power to the specified user (e.g., the EH EOA).</p>\n<p>When the DAO is ready to take back the funds, a call to <code>recall</code> will pull the tokens out of the <code>Franchiser</code> and return them. There are added methods to batch delegation and recalling which we do not anticipate the DAO will need in this specific case but could use if more delegations of this sort arise. The <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract will create a <code>Franchiser</code> contract as needed for each unique delegator/delegatee pair, while each <code>Franchiser</code> is set up as a <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Clones\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">minimal proxy</a> of a Franchiser implementation contract.</p>\n<p>Each <code>Franchiser</code> contract has to ability for the delegatee to subdelegate their delegated tokens to further subdelegatees. This creates a tree of <code>Franchise</code> contracts with the original delegator/delegatee Franchise contract at the head, each subdelegation from a delegatee at each child node, and the tokens being transferred down the tree to imbue voting power. The original delegatee can sub-delegate up to eight times with each of these sub-delegating up to four, then two, then one. Counting the maximum possible nodes in each level of the tree totals to $<code>(1)+(8)+(8 \\cdot 4)+(8 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2)+(8 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2) = 169</code>$ nodes. At each Franchiser contract in this tree, the delegatee can unsubdelegate and return all of the funds transferred down the tree to their own contract and restore their full voting power delegation. The <code>recall</code> method mentioned above does the same thing but returns all tokens from the tree to the original delegator.</p>\n<p>The scope also includes an optional <code>FranchiserLens</code> contract which contains <code>view</code> functions to get data from the Franchiser tree in flat formats. It is not necessary for the other contracts in scope but would give the DAO easy visibility into their delegation and any further subdeldegations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-model-and-trust-assumptions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#security-model-and-trust-assumptions-5\"></a>Security Model and Trust Assumptions</h2>\n<p>This code relies on the <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenZeppelin Contracts library</a> for cloning, checking for code size, and for set operations.

If the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract is to be used solely for this one EH delegation, it is possible to change the <code>INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES</code> to one and make further subdelegations by EH impossible. This would ensure that they do not have the ability to further subdelegate to another actor who is not in the proposal but would make vote splitting by subdelegation impossible by EH (at least until <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387\">fractional voting is brought to the governor</a>).</p>\n<p>Of course, by delegating in the first place, the DAO is already trusting EH to behave as promised. Thus, further subdelegations being used maliciously to vote in other ways appears to be a minor risk that is mitigated by the ability to revoke the funds. However, revoking is a slow process that would require a vote to pass as the L2 Governor would be the original delegator. A way around it would be to transfer the funds directly to the security council and entrust them to create the subdelegation from the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract. We are not aware, however, of a precedent or authority for the council to behave this way.</p>\n<p>Possible ways to improve the code and tailor it specifically to Arbitrum’s needs would be to give the non-emergency security council the ability to recall the funds. This can be done by allowing the council to be specified at initial delegation and adding an ability for them to call the <code>recall</code> function. However, even then, a call to <code>recall</code> (even <code>unSubDelegate</code>) could be front-run to get in a last vote before losing voting power. A fix for this could be to add some sort of authorization method for the delegatee to vote only on approved votes, but this seems overly protective and operationally taxing to implement. No matter what the community chooses or how the contract iterates, we will review any on-chain proposal for construction/delegation and opine on its safety and features.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Resolved in <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser/blob/101d01da9b6ca33bf3e9ad1bf12841fc96e5ab8a/src/FranchiserFactory.sol#L18\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commit 101d01d</a>.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-13\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This audit covered the Franchiser contracts provided by Event Horizon. They will allow the Arbitrum DAO to transfer a token through the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> to a <code>Franchiser</code> contract which will delegate it’s voting power to Event Horizon, allowing them to vote in proposals. The <code>Franchiser</code> contract as audited allows Event Horizon to further subdelegate their tokens. If the DAO is not interested in using this contract for further grants, we recommend the DAO remove this subdelegation ability from the contracts by setting the <code>INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES</code> constant to one. We also found no security issues with the contracts and our notes contain only recommendations for coding practices. We welcome iteration on the contracts and will be auditing any changes and on-chain proposals involving them. We are grateful to the Event Horizon team for being responsive during the audit and for bringing a compelling use case to the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-arbitrum-franchiser-audit/25702\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-arbitrum-franchiser-audit/25702","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 17:37:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25702"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-arbitrum-franchiser-audit/25702.rss","#text":"Event Horizon Arbitrum Franchiser Audit"},"filter":false},{"title":"Fractal ID Hack - Call for New KYC/KYB Service Provider Nominations","dc:creator":"mcfly","category":"General","description":"<p>Dear Arbitrum DAO community,</p>\n<p>On July 14th, Fractal ID experienced a major data breach.

Even more important than decentralisation is openness - the degree to which an ecosystem allows for outside-in innovation.</p>\n<p>Decentralisation prevents capture by a small group of participants, but a capture-resistant ecosystem can still die through disruption and being outcompeted. Survival is directly dependent on our ability to adapt and improve, to understand the needs of users, talent, investors, etc. and to provide outstanding solutions. Said otherwise, the key for survival is being able to innovate in how we solve people’s problems.</p>\n<p>Being at the forefront of innovation is a tricky thing. By definition, innovative solutions are not commonly known and understood. Innovation can not be fully planned, it can only be supported and encouraged.</p>\n<p>Critically, because innovative ideas can come from all kinds of places, as an ecosystem, it’s key to be welcoming to innovations that originated somewhere else. Corporations have learnt this lesson the hard way and now commonly fund a trifecta of accelerators, VC funds, and M&amp;A to facilitate outside-in innovation. However, despite these strategies providing some defences to disruption,<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1259275/average-company-lifespan/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20average%20lifespan,even%20further%20throughout%20the%202020s.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> the lifespan of corporations keeps decreasing</a>. More needs to be done!</p>\n<p>For an organisation designer like myself, DAOs are exciting because they promise both capture resistance AND a radical upgrade in our ability to incorporate outside-in innovation. Instead of problems being discussed behind closed doors, DAOs can employ open communication platforms. Instead of rejecting anything ‘not invented here’, DAOs can celebrate experimentation. Instead of falling for the shorter-mist allure of cost-cutting and reducing redundancy, DAOs can decentralise operations and experiment with a variety of methods. In sum, DAOs can transform organisations from closed to open, leading to better outcomes for users, contributors, and investors.</p>\n<p>DAOs could do that but right now that’s far from certain. The allure of centralisation is strong. Innovation compounds over time but it’s hard to measure in the early stages. When appropriate methodologies and assessment frameworks are not in place, cost-cutting (disguised as efficiency) quickly kills anything hard to quantify or explain.</p>\n<p>This is not a new problem, a range of methodologies and tools for what’s called open innovation has been slowly maturing. <a href=\"https://rndao.mirror.xyz/TxGTNemp_c4uNeWGiubJbC3akaNfJIJYcbgQZrHLK10\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Our research shows</a> that sense-making (being able to identify and prioritise challenges and root causes) is the critical first step. We now understand that access to information and being able to search through weak signals is key for outsiders to be able to propose innovations. And we know that offering quick access to funding for small experiments is critical for anything innovative to ever be tested.</p>\n<p>The lack of tools and methodologies for open innovation (or lack of awareness that they even exist), leads many to conclude that only closed-door meetings are effective. <a href=\"https://x.com/_Daniel_Ospina/status/1810670977174417918\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">As Disruption Joe eloquently said</a>, DAOs suffer through a common pattern of decentralising (poorly), then worrying about execution, centralising, and finally stagnating. Let’s avoid this faith; let’s avoid the false dichotomy of centralisation and decentralisation; let’s welcome outside-in innovation. Let’s build open organisations!</p>\n<p>We’re exploring this territory through RnDAO, and we want to work with Arbitrum to make the DAO more open and innovative:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sense-making capability: <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd096c5d610d4455bcae4bff719d18345939c5d6b20d56c6a1f37d0247ad10f71\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Jumpstart Fund proposal</a> (now in Snapshot) and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site/25660\">Off-Site proposal</a> (in forum)</li>\n<li>access to information: Proposal coming soon, let us know if you want to get involved early!</li>\n<li>quick access to fund experiments: some mechanisms already in place through Questbook tracks.

Initially, the community was hesitant to sell ARB tokens, resulting in the decision not to convert them. As a result, the remaining funds are insufficient to cover the planned six-month term. The ARDC is requesting an additional 1,200,000 ARB to support operations through August and September, ensuring they can fulfill their mandate. Any surplus funds will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> - The Proposal aims to ensure that the ArbitrumDAO satisfies its payment obligations to ARDC members that were duly elected by the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong> - The proposal will move to a Snapshot vote on the 25th of july.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong> - 1,200,000ARB</p>\n<h1><a name=\"request-for-additional-funding-for-the-ardc-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#request-for-additional-funding-for-the-ardc-1\"></a>Request for Additional Funding for the ARDC</h1>\n<p>[1] Background</p>\n<p>Following the establishment of the Arbitrum Research &amp; Development Collective (‘ARDC’) for an initial 6-month term, we have encountered challenges due to the price fluctuation of ARB tokens. In the proposal passed on <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/56002054155248055908873103086558103132748843103210580613728556162036150296506\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tally</a> and executed on 25-Jan-2024, 1.76M ARB was transferred to the multi-sig wallet worth approximately $3.06M USD at the time (with ARB priced at around $1.74). Currently, the price of ARB is approximately $0.75, resulting in a significant reduction in the purchasing power of ARB, now valued at less than half its original amount.</p>\n<p>At the time, there was community hesitance in relation to OTC’ing the ARB supplied to the ARDC. Hence, this was not done to respect the community sentiment at the time.</p>\n<p>ARDC Members currently get remunerated accordingly as per their election that was held via Snapshot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delphi [72k Worth of ARB/month];</li>\n<li>Blockworks [72K Worth of ARB/month];</li>\n<li>Chaos Labs [53,333 Worth of ARB/month];</li>\n<li>L2Beat [50k ARB for the entire term, in monthly tranches];</li>\n<li>OpenZeppelin [125,000 Worth of ARB /month].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to this volatility, the 1.76M ARB is insufficient to fund the ARDC for its full 6-month term. Currently, the multi-sig wallet holds 163.32k ARB priced at $124,000. To address this, we propose an injection of over and above the original amount requested, which will help fund the ARDC through August and September. This additional funding will enable the ARDC to fully execute its program as originally intended.</p>\n<p>Any excess ARB which will not be utilised will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury.</p>\n<p>[2] Proposal Details:</p>\n<p>Additional Funding Request: We request an additional 1,200,000 ARB to supplement the existing funds used to support the ARDC.</p>\n<p>Return of Surplus Funds: Any surplus funds remaining after the completion of the ARDC’s term will be returned to the DAO.</p>\n<p>[3] Conclusion:</p>\n<p>The ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By providing additional funding to the ARDC to compensate for the negative price movement of the ARB token, the ARDC will be able to fulfil its initial mandate as originally intended.</p>\n

We are pleased to see a sustained increase in this metric.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This graph only includes Communication Rationales. We decided not to count high-impact comments as there are cases where the voting rationale is communicated along with a valuable contribution to the proposal. If we included these high-impact comments, the percentage of Collected Comments would be even higher.</em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"final-conclusions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#final-conclusions-15\"></a>Final Conclusions</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO Delegate Incentive Program has proven effective in increasing both participation and the quality of discussions within the community. The data reflects <em><strong>significant growth</strong></em> in the number of proposals and delegate participation. This comes in a context where activity in Arbitrum DAO has been high, averaging nine proposals per month, even excluding proposals related to the various incentive programs approved by the DAO.</p>\n<p>We observed that the <strong>participation rate of VP from delegates in the program increased by 12% on Snapshot and 13% on Tally during the three months the program has been active</strong>, compared to the three months prior. However, it is important to note that the <strong>average Voting Power on Tally has decreased</strong>. While most voters fall within the lower VP ranges, the data indicates that the majority of VP is concentrated in a small number of addresses, which are crucial for achieving quorum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Delegates who participated in the program showed a high rate of participation in voting and forum contributions</strong></em>. The number of collected comments and participation in forum discussions increased significantly, demonstrating greater engagement from incentivized delegates. <strong>It’s encouraging to see the quantity of discussions rise in the forum.</strong> While there is still room for improvement, we believe we are on the right track.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n

The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured off-site event will be organized right before <a href=\"https://devcon.org/en/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DevCon Thailand</a>, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.</p>\n<p>This proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to identify the most important agenda items to be discussed at the off-site, ensuring the IRL meeting is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The off-site will then include professional facilitation and a distraction-free environment to advance alignment, remove blockers, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.</p>\n<p>The success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively on the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem</h2>\n<p>The DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.</p>\n<p>Areas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution</h2>\n<p>Recent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for IRL events to catalyse progress. We want to build on these learnings and prepare thoroughly to leverage the next big Web3 event (DevCon in Thailand) to advance ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Agenda prioritisation</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Project manager to engage with delegates and key stakeholders, distilling concerns and topic suggestions, and facilitate converging on the agenda.</li>\n<li>Careful planning of each session: aiming to share and agree on frameworks and approaches in advance, focusing IRL discussion on content and not format.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Off-site Event Organization:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>2 full-day event, with the option to participate only one day if needed by some attendees.</li>\n<li>Distraction-free environment (arranged catering and accommodation, separate from other events).</li>\n<li>Focused sessions on key agreed topic(s).</li>\n<li>Professional facilitation for key sessions</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Attendees:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on high-context, expert, and senior participants.

As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the meeting is effective.</p>\n<p>RnDAO can either provide facilitation (we’ve facilitated strategy and org design workshops for years) or we can hire an external facilitator. The tradeoff is high context and full neutrality (as participants of the DAO we’re biased, and although any good facilitator will try to remain neutral, there are still tradeoffs and decisions to be made in moderating conversations).<br>\nAs such, we’ll ask in the Snapshot vote whether the delegates trust us to be the facilitator or would rather have us hire an external facilitator.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"hybrid-participation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#hybrid-participation-8\"></a>Hybrid participation</h2>\n<p>We’ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost $100-$600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties. The online setup is of course less good than being IRL but it is still viable to contribute to sessions (anyone leading a session does need to be IRL but, for input in the discussion, online works).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-9\"></a>Timeline:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>August-September: proposal approval and then logistics planning and preparation (including collecting RSVPs for venue scouting).</li>\n<li>October: Agenda and sessions planning (agenda freeze by November 3rd).
