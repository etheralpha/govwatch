This initiative effectively addresses the DAO’s need for structured problem definition and alignment, ensuring that proposals are well-prepared and strategically aligned. By focusing on early-stage initiatives and using Questbook’s small grants model, we can improve the quality and impact of proposals within the Arbitrum DAO. While the playbook could be a valuable addition, the core elements of this proposal are sufficient to drive significant improvements in our governance and operational processes. This approach will help streamline our decision-making and foster greater engagement within the community.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/governance-pilot-for-a-questbook-jumpstart-fund-for-problem-definition-and-dao-improvement/25648\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/governance-pilot-for-a-questbook-jumpstart-fund-for-problem-definition-and-dao-improvement/25648","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 23:53:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25648"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/governance-pilot-for-a-questbook-jumpstart-fund-for-problem-definition-and-dao-improvement/25648.rss","#text":"Governance：Pilot for a Questbook Jumpstart fund for problem definition and DAO improvement"},"filter":false},{"title":"Frax Finance Bi-Weekly Update (7/16/2024)","dc:creator":"Frax.Finance","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h2><a name=\"recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-1\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h2>\n<p>ARB Received Last Disbursement: 125,000 ARB</p>\n<p>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks: 121,376 ARB</p>\n<p>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Contract Address</th>\n<th>Contract Tag/Name</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0x4645e6476d3a5595be9efd39426cc10586a8393d</td>\n<td>Curve -

intend to distribute approximately 166,000 ARB during epoch 3 and an additional 166,000 ARB in epoch 4. As for the Trading Incentives program, we plan to allocate around 150,000 ARB initially, followed by another 175,000 ARB one week later.</p>\n<p>Currently, our focus is on assisting accepted grantees in achieving their milestones more efficiently before the conclusion of the STIP Bridge program. Once the grantee’s milestones are successfully completed, we anticipate disbursing approximately $100,000 ARB.</p>\n<p>The trading incentives provided by GMX fell significantly short of their projected goal last week. The aim, as communicated through various channels, had been to ‘reduce trading fees on GMX by up to 75%’.</p>\n<p>The 150,000 ARB provided for trading incentives only resulted in a net trading fee rebate of around 15%, due to a decrease in the value of ARB coupled with a vast increase in trading volume on GMX.</p>\n<p>This disparity resulted in some critical community feedback, and reflection on the allocation and its underlying assumptions.</p>\n<p>To compensate for the unexpected shortfall, the GMX Grants Committee decided to provide an additional 150,000 ARB as trading incentives for this past week.</p>\n<p>This one-time retroactive bonus distribution brings the actual rebate more in line with the stated aim.</p>\n<p>We are planning to disburse around <strong>757,000</strong> <strong>ARB in incentives, and currently, we have around</strong> <strong>274,414.55</strong>  ARB in our multi-sig.

By addressing areas such as rising expenditures, diversifying income streams, managing ARB sell pressure, and optimizing the treasury’s risk exposure, the DAO can fortify its financial health. These are common challenges faced by many DAOs and, which with the right actions, can be overcome.</p>\n<p>With this context in mind, Avantgarde proposes a holistic treasury management process designed to enhance the DAO’s long-term sustainability. Our plan focuses on the strategic diversification of the treasury to generate yield on treasury assets while reducing risk. By implementing this structured approach, we can effectively manage the sell pressure on ARB. We believe it is important to act now to ensure a more stable future for the DAO making it more resilient in future downturns.</p>\n<p>We’re very supportive of the recent proposal by Karpatkey and Gauntlet and would like to put ourselves forward as an option alongside them. We feel that there are strong benefits to manager diversification for several reasons;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Diversification of infrastructure risk</li>\n<li>Variety of approaches &amp; strategies to provide more diversified returns across different market cycles</li>\n<li>A more heterogeneous set of strategies will facilitate the spread of liquidity across the ecosystem</li>\n<li>Provides the DAO Oversight Committee with more data points to assess across multiple managers</li>\n<li>Provides the DAO Oversight Committee with flexibility in the event a manager is not performing (can easily move allocation to another manager in the program)</li>\n<li>Removing a single point of failure is in line with Arbitrum’s ethos towards decentralisation</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Treasury Volatility &amp; Diversification</p>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO currently holds 98% of its treasury in its native token, a heavily concentrated portfolio. Though this is similar to many other DAOs in the space, it can be problematic from a treasury management perspective for a number of reasons. Firstly, holding an entire portfolio in a single asset exposes the treasury to significant risk of failure - even the most optimally run organisations (whether traditional or decentralised) can be impacted by black swan events outside of its control - diversification is a hedge against one’s inability to perfectly predict the future. Secondly, the risk is amplified when that asset is the project’s own token, since its price is linked to the fundamental performance of the project - this constrains the ability of the treasury to act as a counter cyclical buffer when the project is most in need of liquidity. Thirdly, crypto is volatile, far more so than other prices in the economy. This creates a mismatch between a DAOs assets and its liabilities, which include the cash outflows for the current and future projects it intends to fund through its treasury. Though grant payments might be denominated in crypto, human labour is still priced against its own costs, which are largely still denominated in fiat - even during the heightened economic volatility of recent years, price changes in the real economy still pale in comparison to the price movements of most tokens.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"goals-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#goals-3\"></a>Goals</h1>\n<p>The goal as treasury manager is to improve long term sustainability of the Arbitrum DAO, achieved through a number of sub objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allocate to strategies that generate an alternative revenue stream to buffer against poor market conditions</li>\n<li>Initiatives to improve the liquidity of the DAO’s native token</li>\n<li>Managing any price impact of the ARB token from treasury management operations</li>\n<li>(Future direction subject to DAO coordination) Utilise treasury management strategies that bring the risk of the DAO treasury in line with financial objectives</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-to-avantgarde-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-to-avantgarde-4\"></a>Introduction to Avantgarde</h1>\n<p>Avantgarde is a crypto native asset management, advisory and research firm, specialising in asset liability management, R&amp;D, special situations, risk monitoring and on-chain diversification strategies. Avantgarde has conducted work for leading protocols including Uniswap, The Graph, Arbitrum, Nexus Mutual, Paraswap, Enzyme and others. DAOs leverage Avantgarde’s combined expertise in protocol development and asset management for developing strategies to improve treasury sustainability.</p>\n<p>There are many approaches to DAO treasury management. Our philosophy is to take a longer term and data driven approach (where appropriate), with a preference for simplicity over complexity, and to focus on diversification across the treasury management process.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde has been involved with Arbitrum’s Treasury &amp; Sustainability Working Group since the early stages, including the production of a <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-research-risk-reduction-in-dao-treasuries/20662/2\">study</a> focusing on how traditional asset classes, accessed via real world assets, can reduce risk within DAO treasuries which played a role in the evolution of the STEP program to where it is today</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-strategy-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-strategy-5\"></a>Proposed Strategy</h1>\n<p>Risk Reduction</p>\n<p>Although the realised volatility of ARB has been lower recently compared to previous years, it remains at nearly double that of BTC and ETH. Whilst it is worth acknowledging volatility is far from an exhaustive measure of risk, it is useful in a treasury management context since higher volatility reduces the certainty of future grants, diminishing visibility and making longer term financial planning more difficult.</p>\n<p>One pillar of the strategy will look to de-risk the treasury through allocations into lower volatility assets, such as stablecoins and ETH, whilst making considerations for ARB liquidity to regulate sell pressure.</p>\n<p>Revenue Generation</p>\n<p>A by-product of thoughtful diversification of the treasury is the potential for generating revenues for the DAO. In addition to reducing treasury volatility, allocations in stablecoins and ETH can be put to work in DeFi to generate yield that will support DAO sustainability. A key focus of the DeFi strategies considered will be on risk management and earning a risk-adjusted return consistent with the cash flow needs of the DAO. On-chain rates in DeFi vary by collateral, across protocols, and through time (block by block). To estimate an aggregate measure for yields in DeFi, On-chain Stablecoin Yield looks at a TVL weighted average APR of the most prominent stablecoin lending protocols. Rates are currently above ~7% for the largest stablecoins on the most well known and highest capacity lending pools.</p>\n<p>A separate source of organic on-chain yield is staking rewards on ETH. Though execution layer rewards are more stochastic, consensus layer rewards are far more stable and dependent on the number of validators staking on the network. Current consensus layer APR is around 3%, with execution layer rewards averaging just under 1%.</p>\n<p>In practice there are strategies which can improve on the risk adjusted returns of these simple examples, however they provide a useful baseline to illustrate the potential revenue that can be generated for the DAO.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde will implement a range of treasury strategies via a pre-approved protocol universe and agreed risk parameters (for example via a DAO Oversight Committee) which can be enshrined as policies within treasury management infrastructure tooling (as covered in the following section). Beyond the primary objectives of reducing treasury volatility and generating diversified revenue streams through yield, we will also look to allocate to projects that would foster Arbitrum ecosystem growth, where liquidity and capacity would allow. In addition, we will also consider strategies that can earn yield for the DAO without the need to sell ARB.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"infrastructure-security-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#infrastructure-security-6\"></a>Infrastructure &amp; Security</h1>\n<p>Of crucial importance for any treasury management operation is a trust minimised infrastructure setup where the security of the DAO’s assets is the first priority. Avantgarde has the flexibility to work with multiple treasury management infrastructure providers and we are open to community feedback and preferences to ensure the DAO has peace of mind regarding safety of treasury funds.</p>\n<p>Where there are no specific preferences from the community, Avantgarde have used Enzyme as the infrastructure of choice because its adaptable and time-tested architecture enables DAOs to effortlessly manage permissions, both granting and revoking them, while maintaining non-custodial control of the funds at all times.</p>\n<p>Roles and recommended configuration</p>\n<p>The setup involves three distinct and synergic roles if using Enzyme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vault owner (proposed: Arbitrum DAO or multisig address): The vault owner is the address that has full ownership of the vault settings, permissions, restrictions, etc. Vault owner retains exclusive authority over assets and any future changes if required.</li>\n<li>Depositor (proposed: Arbitrum DAO or multisig address): The depositor is the address that is whitelisted for depositing and withdrawing funds from the vault. When a deposit is made, the depositor’s wallet receives and holds vault shares (ERC-20 tokens).</li>\n<li>Delegated Asset Manager (proposed: Avantgarde Finance): The delegated manager is the address chosen by the vault owner to execute specific asset management strategies. Within the boundaries defined by the vault owner, the delegated manager can carry out predefined operations. This delegation framework combines trustlessness (as rules are enforced by code) with higher efficiency and speed (allowing transactions to be executed promptly). Examples of rules set by vault owners include permitted assets, allowed protocols and strategies, maximum slippage tolerance, and authorised trading venues. Importantly, the vault owner can revoke the delegated permission anytime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key considerations regarding Enzyme’s security</p>\n<p>Security is a paramount concern for Enzyme, and several key factors contribute to this commitment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Live on Mainnet for more than five years, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.</li>\n<li>Every integration undergoes a rigorous <a href=\"https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol/tree/v4/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audit</a> process conducted by Chain Security.</li>\n<li>A substantial <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bounty/enzymefinance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bug bounty</a> program on Immunefi.</li>\n<li>Opt-in <a href=\"https://docs.enzyme.finance/managers/signal-an-upgrade\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Protocol upgrades</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"performance-monitoring-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#performance-monitoring-7\"></a>Performance Monitoring</h1>\n<p>Performance measurement in treasury management is multi-faceted. We believe performance should be defined based on the specific financial objectives the program is looking to achieve. For Arbitrum DAO this is centered around:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Risk reduction - how has the risk profile of the portfolio evolved over the reporting period, across measures such as volatility, smart contract risk exposure, and tracking error of stablecoin positions.</li>\n<li>Revenue generation - what level of income has the portfolio been able to generate in both absolute terms and relative to yields across the market, in the context of the stated risk profile of the mandate.</li>\n<li>Portfolio composition - how has the diversification of the portfolio evolved over the reporting period, with reference to the long term diversification objectives of the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An important emphasis is that measurement of risk is as important as levels of return for the DAO to ensure that a manager is remaining consistent with their stated mandate.</p>\n<p>We recognise that the appropriate breadth &amp; cadence of reporting will evolve based on market conditions and events. Transparency is at the core of Avantgarde’s philosophy, and we will be committed to regular dialogue with relevant DAO community members to ensure the highest standards of accountability are maintained.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"fees-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#fees-8\"></a>Fees</h1>\n<p>0.75% on AUM (all-in fee) for a mandate &lt;$50m</p>\n<p>0.45% on AUM (all-in fee) for a mandate &gt;$50m</p>\n<h1><a name=\"contribution-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#contribution-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem-9\"></a>Contribution to the Arbitrum ecosystem</h1>\n<p>As part of our DAO advisory work, Avantgarde is proud to be working closely with Enzyme DAO to support them with their Arbitrum deployment and securing other biz-dev partners for launch. This effort should help increase TVL and transactions on the Arbitrum network and we’re excited to share more on this in coming weeks.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"appendix-manager-diversification-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#appendix-manager-diversification-10\"></a>Appendix - Manager Diversification</h1>\n<p>A key driver for this proposal is to improve long term sustainability through diversification. There are many aspects of diversification that can improve the robustness of the DAO’s treasury, not just at the asset level, but also at the treasury manager level and infrastructure level. As stated in the summary, although this is a proposal for Avantgarde to be considered as a treasury manager for the Arbitrum DAO, we are true believers in the benefits of diversification and we would urge the community to also consider allocations to multiple treasury managers for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Arbitrum ecosystem places great importance on decentralisation and we believe this core tenet should also be applied in the context of treasury management.</li>\n<li>Diversifying across multiple managers, with different approaches and infrastructure setups, will reduce risk and ensure decentralisation of DAO treasury management decisions going forward.</li>\n<li>It will also provide for more fluid expansion of ecosystem liquidity, with multiple allocators spreading capital over a more heterogeneous set of projects than would be the case with one single service provider.</li>\n<li>Manager diversification is established as best practice for institutional capital allocators and Arbitrum’s treasury should aspire to have robust processes put in place from the outset in order to facilitate future growth and development within the DAO.</li>\n<li>A multi-manager set up is in line with the proposed DAO Oversight Committee, who will have more data points to compare &amp; contrast, and more levers to pull in the event any one manager is underperforming in on their KPIs.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/diversification-and-strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25579\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/diversification-and-strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25579","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 13:25:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25579"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/diversification-and-strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25579.rss","#text":"Diversification and Strategic Treasury Management on Arbitrum"},"filter":false},{"title":"Introducing the Polity GRADE Programme","dc:creator":"Markman","category":"DAO Programs & Initiatives","description":"<h4><a name=\"introducing-polity-grade-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introducing-polity-grade-1\"></a>Introducing Polity GRADE</h4>\n<p>Hello Arbitrum Community!</p>\n<p>We’re excited to introduce the Polity GRADE Programme, an innovative tool designed to enhance the grant evaluation process within the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem.

To address this, a pilot fund is proposed, utilizing Questbook’s small grants model to support early-stage initiatives focused on problem definition (root causes, gathering requirements), alignment, and scoping proposals for operational and governance improvements. A problem gathering exercise will be conducted to inform proposers and the assessor by identifying key problem areas through user research interviews, qualitative surveys of delegates and other stakeholders, and a collective intelligence algorithm, clustering initiatives to ensure alignment between proposals and the DAO’s current needs.<br>\nThe pilot fund will prioritize initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO’s operations and governance. An assessor, elected by the DAO, will oversee the proposal assessment, following the established Questbook program rules. The success of this pilot will be measured by the number of initiatives that receive subsequent funding, clarity and alignment generated within the community, and an over 80% approval rate in a Snapshot vote to continue the program.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem:</h1>\n<p>The DAO has multiple challenges but currently needs a way to fund the initial steps of addressing them. As a result, only groups with a lot to win will invest all the necessary time and effort and take the risk to evolve a proposal without being paid.</p>\n<p>Areas like organisation design, strategy, spending plan, and more require not just crafting a proposal but they require problem definition work: significant stakeholder engagement to determine the right approach, understand root causes and requirements, generate buy-in, and craft the right proposal to make. There’s currently no way to fund all this problem definition and preparatory work leading to the DAO advancing slowly, delegates being overwhelmed assessing proposals that don’t quite hit the mark, and meanwhile key decisions and needed proposals don’t happen.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>A method for the DAO to aggregate challenge statements or problems</li>\n<li>A funding program for initiatives that will carry out problem definition and initial solution work on one of the challenge statements.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Questbook has shown to be a viable mechanism for distributing small grants to groups. We propose to use this model and set up a pilot fund to evolve proposals that address key Operational and Governance needs to improve Arbiturm DAO.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’ll carry out a “collective intelligence exercise” to identify the key problem areas.<br>\nAnd we’re including an option in the Snapshot to also fund a Playbook for Proposing to the DAO, where we’ll gather the learnings of the grantees who successfully pass a proposal through the DAO and the challenges of those who didn’t, and document them as material for future grantees.</p>\n<p><strong>What will be funded via the Jumpstart Fund:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early-stage initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO ops and gov</li>\n<li>Priority for funding initiatives advancing problem definition and alignment around key challenges.</li>\n<li>Requirement for being referred by at least 3 of the top 30 delegates.</li>\n<li>Priority for proposals including a last milestone for a successful snapshot vote (i.e. success bonus of at least 10%).</li>\n<li>Initiatives expected to last up to 3 months.</li>\n<li>Initiatives can request up to USD$50k equivalent (subsequent submissions considered).</li>\n<li>product/protocol development will not be funded (that’s better suited for other Questbook tracks or programs).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>** How are proposals assessed:**</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An assessor will be selected by the DAO via an election as conducted for previous Questbook tracks.</li>\n<li>Proposals up to USD $25k can be approved directly by the assessor for this track. Proposals above this amount requires cross-checking with the assessors form other tracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fund governance:</strong></p>\n<p>This track will follow the same rules as the ongoing Questbook program (<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326\">link</a>), whereby funds are held in the multisig operated by the assessors of the multiple Questbook tracks.<br>\nThe totality of the funds are to be transferred there and the signers will provide payment for the service provision parts upon completion (e.g. problem assessment, playbook if completed, etc).</p>\n<p><strong>Method to Identify Problem Areas:</strong></p>\n<p>Before opening the fund to proposals, we’ll work with the DAO to identify key problem areas that could then lead to proposals for problem definition and alignment work. This work will be carried by RnDAO’s research team.</p>\n<p>Based on Professor Daniel Kahneman’s work, we have selected a collective intelligence method that provides high efficiency (low time involvement required from delegates) and is credibly neutral. The method is based on the use of a qualitative survey of delegates and other stakeholders to collect a list of statements proposing key challenges. We’ll complement this mechanism with user research interviews with the top 30 delegates.<br>\nThe statements are then analysed using a collective intelligence algorithm (SimScore) that identifies a theoretical ‘central’ statement that would be most agreed upon, and then analyses the provided statements to rank them for proximity to said theoretical centre.</p>\n<p>The ranked statements, as well as the graph (positioning of statements relative to each other), will then be made publicly available to inform (not mandate, just inform) those proposing initiatives to the pilot fund.</p>\n<p>(Further untangling between statements and root cause analysis is part of the work this Questbook track will fund.)</p>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-5\"></a>Timeline:</h1>\n<p>The Pilot is expected to last 4-6 months depending on whether the option to distil learnings into a playbook for proposing to the DAO is approved in Snapshot or not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Month 1 for identifying problem areas.</li>\n<li>Month 2-4 for assessing and funding proposals.</li>\n<li>Month 5 for reporting</li>\n<li>month 6 for (optional) collecting learnings about proposal development into playbook</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-success-look-like-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-does-success-look-like-6\"></a>What does success look like?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Experts in the community can work towards improving Arbiturm DAO.</li>\n<li>The initiatives funded generate clarity, buy-in, and alignment,</li>\n<li>The initiatives funded evolve towards full proposals for the DAO and are funded.</li>\n<li>The delegates love this pilot and want to continue funding it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>KPIs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>40%+ of initiatives continued and received subsequent funding</li>\n<li>Over 80% approval in a Snapshot vote asking delegates whether the program should be continued after the pilot</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"budget-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#budget-7\"></a>Budget</h1>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xaIktXwaW8iFxhVuWy0DNLDPxdC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-07-14 at 08.50.38\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_690x325.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-14 at 08.50.38\" data-base62-sha1=\"xaIktXwaW8iFxhVuWy0DNLDPxdC\" width=\"690\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_690x325.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_1035x487.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_1380x650.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E2E4E8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Note on forum restrictions:<br>\nThis proposal was originally posted 9 days ago (at the start of GovHack), then moved to the GovHack category when the submission guidelines for that were announced.

We aim to broaden our impact across Latin America by strategically amplifying our evergreen content through social media channels. Following our Content &amp; Social Media Strategy, we’ll engage Spanish-speaking audiences with informative and educational posts about Arbitrum. Simultaneously, we’re launching a dynamic Telegram community to facilitate discussions and provide timely updates.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we’re actively cultivating partnerships with influential Web3 communities and figures. Recently, we collaborated with Sheinix for a live session on YouTube, leveraging their 70k+ followers to extend our reach and share valuable insights within the ecosystem. These initiatives are crucial as we continue to strengthen Arbitrum’s presence and engagement in the region.</p>\n<p><em>Feel free to check our Content &amp; Social Media Strategy for this second stage <a href=\"https://fourth-millennium-f8b.notion.site/Content-Social-Media-Strategy-Arbitrum-Latam-a56ea7f3c18746e8ac66f94a8b017b69\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"academic-collaborations-handshake-mortar_board-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#academic-collaborations-handshake-mortar_board-4\"></a>Academic Collaborations <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12\" title=\":handshake:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":handshake:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/mortar_board.png?v=12\" title=\":mortar_board:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":mortar_board:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h3>\n<p>A crucial aspect for generating real growth within the region is reaching audiences who are still outside the ecosystem and have not yet gone down the rabbit hole. This audience, this enormous mass of potential users, talents, and collaborators, is eager to learn, a sentiment we notice in every university we engage with. The story repeated itself time and again: students and professionals of all ages seek to educate themselves about the Web3 ecosystem, and in the face of lingering skepticism and suspicions surrounding the ecosystem, they see the academic environment as a “safe” place to do so.</p>\n<p>The Web3 community also has a growing need for professionals and talented individuals, and so there is genuine interest and synergy that deserves to be exploited for the benefit of all.</p>\n<p>Our educational focus in universities centers around Arbitrum and is delivered through tailored classes designed for the diverse audiences at different institutions. Currently, we have over 10 collaborations scheduled throughout 2024 with many of Argentina’s leading private and public educational institutions. Recently, we initiated an outreach program to establish partnerships with universities in Chile, Uruguay, and Colombia.</p>\n<p>On June 4th, a 2-hour in-person class was conducted at the International Finance Laboratory of UADE, detailed further below.

This post focuses on aggregating the learnings from these case studies into a consolidated review to help delegates and protocols improve their decision-making in the future.</p>\n<p>The post starts with a risk analysis of the program on these protocols. It then examines the efficiency of incentive spending, offering actionable insights from case studies to form recommended best practices. This leads to a discussion of incentive elements that should ideally be included in future programs.</p>\n<p>The original analyses can be found here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-1-vertex/23848\">Vertex Protocol</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-2-silo-finance/24752\">Silo Finance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-3-pendle-finance/25254\">Pendle Finance</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"risk-footprint-of-the-stip-program-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#risk-footprint-of-the-stip-program-2\"></a>Risk Footprint of the STIP program</h1>\n<p>Overall, there is little evidence that the STIP program contributed to an increase in adverse outcomes manifesting due to the risks introduced. The potential risks identified, such as protocol bad debt, cascading liquidations, overleveraged activity causing price wicks, etc., did not occur during the program.</p>\n<p>However, the absence of adverse outcomes does not mean that the program did not alter the risk profile of the Arbitrum ecosystem.  Risk management must acknowledge that there is always a distribution of potential outcomes, and we need to contain the worst possible outcomes to maintain long-term stability.</p>\n<p>We believe that the starting point of the program coming in a bear market with little appetite for leverage or experimentation by users allowed for the dramatic but safe growth on <a href=\"https://vertexprotocol.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vertex Protocol</a>, <a href=\"https://www.silo.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Silo Finance</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pendle.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pendle Finance</a> as these protocols went from being under-utilized to a reasonable level of utilization.  This does not mean that similar risk outcomes would likely be observed should this growth start from a higher level.</p>\n<p>Chaos Labs recommends that the Arbitrum DAO stay vigilant, particularly where exposures are leveraged and composed of multiple protocol dependencies. To help ensure that risk management remains part of decision-making at all times, it is recommended to add a risk section to future incentive program application forms. This section should ask protocols to explicitly declare potential risks, cross-ecosystem dependencies and integrations, and a plan for mitigating these over the program.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"productive-incentive-attributes-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#productive-incentive-attributes-3\"></a>Productive Incentive Attributes</h1>\n<p>All three of the case studies examined grew their activity by multiple orders of magnitude, compared with an average TVL growth of 9.2% by STIP recipients. This presents us with many clear, actionable incentive strategies and tactics from the program for the Arbitrum DAO to learn from.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Experiment and Iterate:</strong> Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way.  This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2.  The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning.  There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:</strong> Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:</strong> This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Incentivizing Mercenary Behavior:</strong> Wash trading, sybils, and other inorganic activity is solely the result of incentives rewarding such activity and these strategies will be unwound as soon as the incentives end. There is no long-term benefit to incentives spent on these strategies as they are not retained after the program ends. Legitimate strategies earn fewer rewards as a result, and the program impact is diluted.  There was limited evidence of this in the case studies as activity was mainly subject to a small positive fee.<br>\n<strong>Use Incentives to Increase Integrations and Composability:</strong> Incentivizing the end use case was a powerful growth driver for growing the ecosystem of a protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:</strong> Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium.  This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal.  This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain Momentum with Native Incentives:</strong> If feasible, it is advisable to maintain momentum in the most impactful areas through protocol incentives once the incentive program ends. This strategy can better retain activity and position the application more favorably than others in its sector.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"potential-improvements-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#potential-improvements-4\"></a>Potential Improvements</h1>\n<p>Despite the positive STIP outcomes of the protocols analyzed, certain potential improvements were identified that could have made their use of incentives yield even greater results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Onboarding New Users Has the Greatest Positive Impact:</strong> This is easier said than done, given the general microstructure of DeFi.  It would be highly beneficial for applications running on Arbitrum and the Arbitrum ecosystem broadly for incentives to experiment with onboarding new users without getting exploited by sybils.</li>\n<li><strong>Aspire to Broaden the Incentive Distribution:</strong> Expanding on the previous point highlights that the wider the incentive effect, the more diverse and extensive the onboarded activity will be, leading to a healthier application marketplace. Exactly what determines the optimal distribution is application-specific, with different types of apps naturally growing different activity concentration microstructures.</li>\n<li><strong>Align Incentives with Ecosystem Goals:</strong> It does not make sense to grow elements of the Arbitrum ecosystem that are being deprecated over the long term. Bridged USDC.e growth is one element identified that grew as a result of these incentives and is being wound down, making it not an optimal area to target with incentives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The three case studies performed on Vertex Protocol, Silo Finance, and Pendle Finance provided many vital takeaways for Arbitrum DAO members and protocols to consider in future incentive programs.  This analysis covered the impact of the STIP program from a risk and efficiency standpoint.</p>\n<p>Although little consequence was observed due to risks manifesting, this can be attributed to market conditions at the program outset, and future iterations will likely play out differently.  We recommend close scrutiny of the potential for incentives to drive users too far along the risk curve, to the point where the ecosystem destabilizes.  Protocols should be asked to include a plan to contain the impacts of incentive-induced excessive risk-taking in their application forms going forward.</p>\n<p>Several consistent behaviors led to the success of these protocols’ incentive programs. The consistency of these behaviors, along with their overlap with traditional digital marketing strategies, gives us confidence in recommending their implementation in future incentive programs.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a brief list of incentive attributes that were not included but could have further enhanced the impact of these programs is provided. These elements are not straightforward or as evident as the positive aspects and should be considered as areas for future experimentation and improvement.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 12:36:11 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25515"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515.rss","#text":"STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings"},"filter":false},{"title":"Arbitrum Universe Explorer: Mapping the Future of Blockchain Interoperability","dc:creator":"gokuplay2win","category":"General","description":"<p><strong>Introduction</strong> As you are aware, Arbitrum Orbit represents a Universe of Chains, an expansive ecosystem of interconnected blockchain networks.<br>\nOur proposal, <strong>The Arbitrum Universe Explorer</strong>, aims to bring this universe under one comprehensive visualization tool.

We want to take this opportunity to thank them for resolving potential issues in a quick and orderly manner. We would also like to thank the STIP &amp; STIP Bridge multi-sig committees for their invaluable assistance in navigating subjective areas pertaining to whether certain actions should be (or not be) deemed as misuse of funds.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is only a single project that failed to return funds to the DAO. We are left with no choice but to publicly share this information with the DAO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Furucombo (cc: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/blazar\">@Blazar</a>):\n<ul>\n<li>Furucombo has not published a final STIP report.</li>\n<li>It appears they sent the 59.5K ARB from the STIP to Kraken accounts, making it unclear how incentives were spent.</li>\n<li>Additionally, the project froze incentives towards ‘wash traders’, with users claiming they <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/furucombo-used-arbitrum-grants-to-incentivize-stealing-user-funds/23269/7\">received significantly fewer rewards than expected</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furucombo have notified us (and StableLabs) that the funds will be returned. However, after subsequent requests from us, the funds still remain in their possession.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps?</strong></p>\n<p>Furucombo will have 1 week to present their case to the ArbitrumDAO as a reply on this thread.</p>\n<p>If the project’s explanation is not to the Arbitrum Foundation’s satisfaction, and the funds (~59.5k ARB) are not returned within the same week, the Arbitrum Foundation will seek a vote from the ArbitrumDAO on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should Furucombo, including all founders, current team members, and affiliated contributors, be permanently banned from all future ArbitrumDAO programs?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is also an option, assuming Furucombo is banned from the ArbitrumDAO, for the Arbitrum Foundation to further enforce the grant agreement signed with Furucombo and seek legal recourse to return the funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>\n<p>The DAO is still young, and it is natural for it to learn with time and experience. Based on the incentive programs to date, here are some lessons that the Arbitrum Foundation have observed, that can hopefully be taken forward into future programs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Going forward, STIP rules should be more clearly defined on deadlines in which an incentive grant should be claimed by users and remaining funds to the ArbitrumDAO.</li>\n<li>Funds should be distributed from addresses that are solely used for incentive programs and projects should avoid commingled of funds. Put another way, it should be very straightforward to follow via on-chain transactions how the incentives are distributed.</li>\n<li>An incentive program should specify an authority, or a group of people, who are responsible for interpretation of the rules of the incentive program and whether a project has misused funds. To date, this responsibility has fallen on the appointed multisig, and the exact powers are not clear.</li>\n<li>All projects must be encouraged and required to report any change to their incentive program to the ArbitrumDAO. If there is a material change, it should require approval from an appropriate authority for the incentive program.</li>\n<li>On-chain analytic companies should be hired to help track the distribution of incentives in real-time.
