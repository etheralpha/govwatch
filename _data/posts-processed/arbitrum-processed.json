By addressing areas such as rising expenditures, diversifying income streams, managing ARB sell pressure, and optimizing the treasury’s risk exposure, the DAO can fortify its financial health. These are common challenges faced by many DAOs and, which with the right actions, can be overcome.</p>\n<p>With this context in mind, Avantgarde proposes a holistic treasury management process designed to enhance the DAO’s long-term sustainability. Our plan focuses on the strategic diversification of the treasury to generate yield on treasury assets while reducing risk. By implementing this structured approach, we can effectively manage the sell pressure on ARB. We believe it is important to act now to ensure a more stable future for the DAO making it more resilient in future downturns.</p>\n<p>We’re very supportive of the recent proposal by Karpatkey and Gauntlet and would like to put ourselves forward as an option alongside them. We feel that there are strong benefits to manager diversification for several reasons;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Diversification of infrastructure risk</li>\n<li>Variety of approaches &amp; strategies to provide more diversified returns across different market cycles</li>\n<li>A more heterogeneous set of strategies will facilitate the spread of liquidity across the ecosystem</li>\n<li>Provides the DAO Oversight Committee with more data points to assess across multiple managers</li>\n<li>Provides the DAO Oversight Committee with flexibility in the event a manager is not performing (can easily move allocation to another manager in the program)</li>\n<li>Removing a single point of failure is in line with Arbitrum’s ethos towards decentralisation</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Treasury Volatility &amp; Diversification</p>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO currently holds 98% of its treasury in its native token, a heavily concentrated portfolio. Though this is similar to many other DAOs in the space, it can be problematic from a treasury management perspective for a number of reasons. Firstly, holding an entire portfolio in a single asset exposes the treasury to significant risk of failure - even the most optimally run organisations (whether traditional or decentralised) can be impacted by black swan events outside of its control - diversification is a hedge against one’s inability to perfectly predict the future. Secondly, the risk is amplified when that asset is the project’s own token, since its price is linked to the fundamental performance of the project - this constrains the ability of the treasury to act as a counter cyclical buffer when the project is most in need of liquidity. Thirdly, crypto is volatile, far more so than other prices in the economy. This creates a mismatch between a DAOs assets and its liabilities, which include the cash outflows for the current and future projects it intends to fund through its treasury. Though grant payments might be denominated in crypto, human labour is still priced against its own costs, which are largely still denominated in fiat - even during the heightened economic volatility of recent years, price changes in the real economy still pale in comparison to the price movements of most tokens.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"goals-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#goals-3\"></a>Goals</h1>\n<p>The goal as treasury manager is to improve long term sustainability of the Arbitrum DAO, achieved through a number of sub objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allocate to strategies that generate an alternative revenue stream to buffer against poor market conditions</li>\n<li>Initiatives to improve the liquidity of the DAO’s native token</li>\n<li>Managing any price impact of the ARB token from treasury management operations</li>\n<li>(Future direction subject to DAO coordination) Utilise treasury management strategies that bring the risk of the DAO treasury in line with financial objectives</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"introduction-to-avantgarde-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-to-avantgarde-4\"></a>Introduction to Avantgarde</h1>\n<p>Avantgarde is a crypto native asset management, advisory and research firm, specialising in asset liability management, R&amp;D, special situations, risk monitoring and on-chain diversification strategies. Avantgarde has conducted work for leading protocols including Uniswap, The Graph, Arbitrum, Nexus Mutual, Paraswap, Enzyme and others. DAOs leverage Avantgarde’s combined expertise in protocol development and asset management for developing strategies to improve treasury sustainability.</p>\n<p>There are many approaches to DAO treasury management. Our philosophy is to take a longer term and data driven approach (where appropriate), with a preference for simplicity over complexity, and to focus on diversification across the treasury management process.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde has been involved with Arbitrum’s Treasury &amp; Sustainability Working Group since the early stages, including the production of a <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-research-risk-reduction-in-dao-treasuries/20662/2\">study</a> focusing on how traditional asset classes, accessed via real world assets, can reduce risk within DAO treasuries which played a role in the evolution of the STEP program to where it is today</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-strategy-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-strategy-5\"></a>Proposed Strategy</h1>\n<p>Risk Reduction</p>\n<p>Although the realised volatility of ARB has been lower recently compared to previous years, it remains at nearly double that of BTC and ETH. Whilst it is worth acknowledging volatility is far from an exhaustive measure of risk, it is useful in a treasury management context since higher volatility reduces the certainty of future grants, diminishing visibility and making longer term financial planning more difficult.</p>\n<p>One pillar of the strategy will look to de-risk the treasury through allocations into lower volatility assets, such as stablecoins and ETH, whilst making considerations for ARB liquidity to regulate sell pressure.</p>\n<p>Revenue Generation</p>\n<p>A by-product of thoughtful diversification of the treasury is the potential for generating revenues for the DAO. In addition to reducing treasury volatility, allocations in stablecoins and ETH can be put to work in DeFi to generate yield that will support DAO sustainability. A key focus of the DeFi strategies considered will be on risk management and earning a risk-adjusted return consistent with the cash flow needs of the DAO. On-chain rates in DeFi vary by collateral, across protocols, and through time (block by block). To estimate an aggregate measure for yields in DeFi, On-chain Stablecoin Yield looks at a TVL weighted average APR of the most prominent stablecoin lending protocols. Rates are currently above ~7% for the largest stablecoins on the most well known and highest capacity lending pools.</p>\n<p>A separate source of organic on-chain yield is staking rewards on ETH. Though execution layer rewards are more stochastic, consensus layer rewards are far more stable and dependent on the number of validators staking on the network. Current consensus layer APR is around 3%, with execution layer rewards averaging just under 1%.</p>\n<p>In practice there are strategies which can improve on the risk adjusted returns of these simple examples, however they provide a useful baseline to illustrate the potential revenue that can be generated for the DAO.</p>\n<p>Avantgarde will implement a range of treasury strategies via a pre-approved protocol universe and agreed risk parameters (for example via a DAO Oversight Committee) which can be enshrined as policies within treasury management infrastructure tooling (as covered in the following section). Beyond the primary objectives of reducing treasury volatility and generating diversified revenue streams through yield, we will also look to allocate to projects that would foster Arbitrum ecosystem growth, where liquidity and capacity would allow. In addition, we will also consider strategies that can earn yield for the DAO without the need to sell ARB.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"infrastructure-security-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#infrastructure-security-6\"></a>Infrastructure &amp; Security</h1>\n<p>Of crucial importance for any treasury management operation is a trust minimised infrastructure setup where the security of the DAO’s assets is the first priority. Avantgarde has the flexibility to work with multiple treasury management infrastructure providers and we are open to community feedback and preferences to ensure the DAO has peace of mind regarding safety of treasury funds.</p>\n<p>Where there are no specific preferences from the community, Avantgarde have used Enzyme as the infrastructure of choice because its adaptable and time-tested architecture enables DAOs to effortlessly manage permissions, both granting and revoking them, while maintaining non-custodial control of the funds at all times.</p>\n<p>Roles and recommended configuration</p>\n<p>The setup involves three distinct and synergic roles if using Enzyme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vault owner (proposed: Arbitrum DAO or multisig address): The vault owner is the address that has full ownership of the vault settings, permissions, restrictions, etc. Vault owner retains exclusive authority over assets and any future changes if required.</li>\n<li>Depositor (proposed: Arbitrum DAO or multisig address): The depositor is the address that is whitelisted for depositing and withdrawing funds from the vault. When a deposit is made, the depositor’s wallet receives and holds vault shares (ERC-20 tokens).</li>\n<li>Delegated Asset Manager (proposed: Avantgarde Finance): The delegated manager is the address chosen by the vault owner to execute specific asset management strategies. Within the boundaries defined by the vault owner, the delegated manager can carry out predefined operations. This delegation framework combines trustlessness (as rules are enforced by code) with higher efficiency and speed (allowing transactions to be executed promptly). Examples of rules set by vault owners include permitted assets, allowed protocols and strategies, maximum slippage tolerance, and authorised trading venues. Importantly, the vault owner can revoke the delegated permission anytime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key considerations regarding Enzyme’s security</p>\n<p>Security is a paramount concern for Enzyme, and several key factors contribute to this commitment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Live on Mainnet for more than five years, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.</li>\n<li>Every integration undergoes a rigorous <a href=\"https://github.com/enzymefinance/protocol/tree/v4/audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audit</a> process conducted by Chain Security.</li>\n<li>A substantial <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bounty/enzymefinance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bug bounty</a> program on Immunefi.</li>\n<li>Opt-in <a href=\"https://docs.enzyme.finance/managers/signal-an-upgrade\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Protocol upgrades</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"performance-monitoring-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#performance-monitoring-7\"></a>Performance Monitoring</h1>\n<p>Performance measurement in treasury management is multi-faceted. We believe performance should be defined based on the specific financial objectives the program is looking to achieve. For Arbitrum DAO this is centered around:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Risk reduction - how has the risk profile of the portfolio evolved over the reporting period, across measures such as volatility, smart contract risk exposure, and tracking error of stablecoin positions.</li>\n<li>Revenue generation - what level of income has the portfolio been able to generate in both absolute terms and relative to yields across the market, in the context of the stated risk profile of the mandate.</li>\n<li>Portfolio composition - how has the diversification of the portfolio evolved over the reporting period, with reference to the long term diversification objectives of the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An important emphasis is that measurement of risk is as important as levels of return for the DAO to ensure that a manager is remaining consistent with their stated mandate.</p>\n<p>We recognise that the appropriate breadth &amp; cadence of reporting will evolve based on market conditions and events. Transparency is at the core of Avantgarde’s philosophy, and we will be committed to regular dialogue with relevant DAO community members to ensure the highest standards of accountability are maintained.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"fees-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#fees-8\"></a>Fees</h1>\n<p>0.75% on AUM (all-in fee) for a mandate &lt;$50m</p>\n<p>0.45% on AUM (all-in fee) for a mandate &gt;$50m</p>\n<h1><a name=\"contribution-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#contribution-to-the-arbitrum-ecosystem-9\"></a>Contribution to the Arbitrum ecosystem</h1>\n<p>As part of our DAO advisory work, Avantgarde is proud to be working closely with Enzyme DAO to support them with their Arbitrum deployment and securing other biz-dev partners for launch. This effort should help increase TVL and transactions on the Arbitrum network and we’re excited to share more on this in coming weeks.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"appendix-manager-diversification-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#appendix-manager-diversification-10\"></a>Appendix - Manager Diversification</h1>\n<p>A key driver for this proposal is to improve long term sustainability through diversification. There are many aspects of diversification that can improve the robustness of the DAO’s treasury, not just at the asset level, but also at the treasury manager level and infrastructure level. As stated in the summary, although this is a proposal for Avantgarde to be considered as a treasury manager for the Arbitrum DAO, we are true believers in the benefits of diversification and we would urge the community to also consider allocations to multiple treasury managers for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Arbitrum ecosystem places great importance on decentralisation and we believe this core tenet should also be applied in the context of treasury management.</li>\n<li>Diversifying across multiple managers, with different approaches and infrastructure setups, will reduce risk and ensure decentralisation of DAO treasury management decisions going forward.</li>\n<li>It will also provide for more fluid expansion of ecosystem liquidity, with multiple allocators spreading capital over a more heterogeneous set of projects than would be the case with one single service provider.</li>\n<li>Manager diversification is established as best practice for institutional capital allocators and Arbitrum’s treasury should aspire to have robust processes put in place from the outset in order to facilitate future growth and development within the DAO.</li>\n<li>A multi-manager set up is in line with the proposed DAO Oversight Committee, who will have more data points to compare &amp; contrast, and more levers to pull in the event any one manager is underperforming in on their KPIs.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/diversification-and-strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25579\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/diversification-and-strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25579","pubDate":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 13:25:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25579"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/diversification-and-strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25579.rss","#text":"Diversification and Strategic Treasury Management on Arbitrum"},"filter":false},{"title":"Introducing the Polity GRADE Programme","dc:creator":"Markman","category":"DAO Programs & Initiatives","description":"<h4><a name=\"introducing-polity-grade-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introducing-polity-grade-1\"></a>Introducing Polity GRADE</h4>\n<p>Hello Arbitrum Community!</p>\n<p>We’re excited to introduce the Polity GRADE Programme, an innovative tool designed to enhance the grant evaluation process within the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem.

To address this, a pilot fund is proposed, utilizing Questbook’s small grants model to support early-stage initiatives focused on problem definition (root causes, gathering requirements), alignment, and scoping proposals for operational and governance improvements. A problem gathering exercise will be conducted to inform proposers and the assessor by identifying key problem areas through user research interviews, qualitative surveys of delegates and other stakeholders, and a collective intelligence algorithm, clustering initiatives to ensure alignment between proposals and the DAO’s current needs.<br>\nThe pilot fund will prioritize initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO’s operations and governance. An assessor, elected by the DAO, will oversee the proposal assessment, following the established Questbook program rules. The success of this pilot will be measured by the number of initiatives that receive subsequent funding, clarity and alignment generated within the community, and an over 80% approval rate in a Snapshot vote to continue the program.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem:</h1>\n<p>The DAO has multiple challenges but currently needs a way to fund the initial steps of addressing them. As a result, only groups with a lot to win will invest all the necessary time and effort and take the risk to evolve a proposal without being paid.</p>\n<p>Areas like organisation design, strategy, spending plan, and more require not just crafting a proposal but they require problem definition work: significant stakeholder engagement to determine the right approach, understand root causes and requirements, generate buy-in, and craft the right proposal to make. There’s currently no way to fund all this problem definition and preparatory work leading to the DAO advancing slowly, delegates being overwhelmed assessing proposals that don’t quite hit the mark, and meanwhile key decisions and needed proposals don’t happen.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>A method for the DAO to aggregate challenge statements or problems</li>\n<li>A funding program for initiatives that will carry out problem definition and initial solution work on one of the challenge statements.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Questbook has shown to be a viable mechanism for distributing small grants to groups. We propose to use this model and set up a pilot fund to evolve proposals that address key Operational and Governance needs to improve Arbiturm DAO.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’ll carry out a “collective intelligence exercise” to identify the key problem areas.<br>\nAnd we’re including an option in the Snapshot to also fund a Playbook for Proposing to the DAO, where we’ll gather the learnings of the grantees who successfully pass a proposal through the DAO and the challenges of those who didn’t, and document them as material for future grantees.</p>\n<p><strong>What will be funded via the Jumpstart Fund:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early-stage initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO ops and gov</li>\n<li>Priority for funding initiatives advancing problem definition and alignment around key challenges.</li>\n<li>Requirement for being referred by at least 3 of the top 30 delegates.</li>\n<li>Priority for proposals including a last milestone for a successful snapshot vote (i.e. success bonus of at least 10%).</li>\n<li>Initiatives expected to last up to 3 months.</li>\n<li>Initiatives can request up to USD$50k equivalent (subsequent submissions considered).</li>\n<li>product/protocol development will not be funded (that’s better suited for other Questbook tracks or programs).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>** How are proposals assessed:**</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An assessor will be selected by the DAO via an election as conducted for previous Questbook tracks.</li>\n<li>Proposals up to USD $25k can be approved directly by the assessor for this track. Proposals above this amount requires cross-checking with the assessors form other tracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fund governance:</strong></p>\n<p>This track will follow the same rules as the ongoing Questbook program (<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326\">link</a>), whereby funds are held in the multisig operated by the assessors of the multiple Questbook tracks.<br>\nThe totality of the funds are to be transferred there and the signers will provide payment for the service provision parts upon completion (e.g. problem assessment, playbook if completed, etc).</p>\n<p><strong>Method to Identify Problem Areas:</strong></p>\n<p>Before opening the fund to proposals, we’ll work with the DAO to identify key problem areas that could then lead to proposals for problem definition and alignment work. This work will be carried by RnDAO’s research team.</p>\n<p>Based on Professor Daniel Kahneman’s work, we have selected a collective intelligence method that provides high efficiency (low time involvement required from delegates) and is credibly neutral. The method is based on the use of a qualitative survey of delegates and other stakeholders to collect a list of statements proposing key challenges. We’ll complement this mechanism with user research interviews with the top 30 delegates.<br>\nThe statements are then analysed using a collective intelligence algorithm (SimScore) that identifies a theoretical ‘central’ statement that would be most agreed upon, and then analyses the provided statements to rank them for proximity to said theoretical centre.</p>\n<p>The ranked statements, as well as the graph (positioning of statements relative to each other), will then be made publicly available to inform (not mandate, just inform) those proposing initiatives to the pilot fund.</p>\n<p>(Further untangling between statements and root cause analysis is part of the work this Questbook track will fund.)</p>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-5\"></a>Timeline:</h1>\n<p>The Pilot is expected to last 4-6 months depending on whether the option to distil learnings into a playbook for proposing to the DAO is approved in Snapshot or not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Month 1 for identifying problem areas.</li>\n<li>Month 2-4 for assessing and funding proposals.</li>\n<li>Month 5 for reporting</li>\n<li>month 6 for (optional) collecting learnings about proposal development into playbook</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"what-does-success-look-like-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#what-does-success-look-like-6\"></a>What does success look like?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Experts in the community can work towards improving Arbiturm DAO.</li>\n<li>The initiatives funded generate clarity, buy-in, and alignment,</li>\n<li>The initiatives funded evolve towards full proposals for the DAO and are funded.</li>\n<li>The delegates love this pilot and want to continue funding it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>KPIs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>40%+ of initiatives continued and received subsequent funding</li>\n<li>Over 80% approval in a Snapshot vote asking delegates whether the program should be continued after the pilot</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"budget-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#budget-7\"></a>Budget</h1>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xaIktXwaW8iFxhVuWy0DNLDPxdC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-07-14 at 08.50.38\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_690x325.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-14 at 08.50.38\" data-base62-sha1=\"xaIktXwaW8iFxhVuWy0DNLDPxdC\" width=\"690\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_690x325.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_1035x487.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e87dd09ed3ab6ed991821046204583703aed9788_2_1380x650.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E2E4E8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Note on forum restrictions:<br>\nThis proposal was originally posted 9 days ago (at the start of GovHack), then moved to the GovHack category when the submission guidelines for that were announced.

Both episodes aim to provide listeners with a deeper understanding of Arbitrum’s technical foundations and current use cases.</p>\n<p><em>You can check our latest Podcasts <a><strong>here</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Spaces</strong> <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rocket.png?v=12\" title=\":rocket:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rocket:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d2c92d4941828c220edeae47f7b853ab5c5aba04.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/u4HhSgYQdIGLpFIr3PP2EceS5lG.png?dl=1\" title=\"Space in the Space 1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d2c92d4941828c220edeae47f7b853ab5c5aba04_2_690x386.png\" alt=\"Space in the Space 1\" data-base62-sha1=\"u4HhSgYQdIGLpFIr3PP2EceS5lG\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d2c92d4941828c220edeae47f7b853ab5c5aba04_2_690x386.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d2c92d4941828c220edeae47f7b853ab5c5aba04.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/d2c92d4941828c220edeae47f7b853ab5c5aba04.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"465568\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In a collaborative session with Everclear representatives, our first Space covered essential topics in the crypto space, including Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum. Beginning with their crypto industry backgrounds and the evolution from Connext Network to Everclear, the discussion explored liquidity fragmentation issues in Layer 2 DeFi and challenges like rebalancing. They delved into concepts of chain interoperability, distinguishing omni chain, cross-chain, and multi-chain systems, and highlighted innovations such as ERC-7281 and xERC-20 tokens. Security concerns and recent bridge hacks were also addressed, alongside Everclear’s innovations like Everchain, Eversync, and their integration with Arbitrum’s Orbit Chain, emphasizing Arbitrum’s unique strengths. Future plans for Everclear, including developments with Connext Bridge and fee refund campaigns in ARB, were previewed as well.</p>\n<p><em>You can access the Space <a href=\"https://x.com/arbitrum_latam/status/1811159297977413883\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Newsletter</strong> <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rolled_up_newspaper.png?v=12\" title=\":rolled_up_newspaper:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rolled_up_newspaper:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/bf8dbd468b52726c2dfe28ee7672261c50b23c88.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/rkyS44W6Zrah2jynUM6J23mxNnW.png?dl=1\" title=\"News4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/bf8dbd468b52726c2dfe28ee7672261c50b23c88_2_690x219.png\" alt=\"News4\" data-base62-sha1=\"rkyS44W6Zrah2jynUM6J23mxNnW\" width=\"690\" height=\"219\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/bf8dbd468b52726c2dfe28ee7672261c50b23c88_2_690x219.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/bf8dbd468b52726c2dfe28ee7672261c50b23c88_2_1035x328.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/bf8dbd468b52726c2dfe28ee7672261c50b23c88.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"AE97E3\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.arbitrumlatam.com/newsletters/newsletter_mensual4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><strong>latest newsletter</strong></a> for June highlighted major developments within the Arbitrum ecosystem, reinforcing our dedication to advancing DeFi accessibility and scalability in Latin America.

This post focuses on aggregating the learnings from these case studies into a consolidated review to help delegates and protocols improve their decision-making in the future.</p>\n<p>The post starts with a risk analysis of the program on these protocols. It then examines the efficiency of incentive spending, offering actionable insights from case studies to form recommended best practices. This leads to a discussion of incentive elements that should ideally be included in future programs.</p>\n<p>The original analyses can be found here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-1-vertex/23848\">Vertex Protocol</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-2-silo-finance/24752\">Silo Finance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-case-study-3-pendle-finance/25254\">Pendle Finance</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"risk-footprint-of-the-stip-program-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#risk-footprint-of-the-stip-program-2\"></a>Risk Footprint of the STIP program</h1>\n<p>Overall, there is little evidence that the STIP program contributed to an increase in adverse outcomes manifesting due to the risks introduced. The potential risks identified, such as protocol bad debt, cascading liquidations, overleveraged activity causing price wicks, etc., did not occur during the program.</p>\n<p>However, the absence of adverse outcomes does not mean that the program did not alter the risk profile of the Arbitrum ecosystem.  Risk management must acknowledge that there is always a distribution of potential outcomes, and we need to contain the worst possible outcomes to maintain long-term stability.</p>\n<p>We believe that the starting point of the program coming in a bear market with little appetite for leverage or experimentation by users allowed for the dramatic but safe growth on <a href=\"https://vertexprotocol.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vertex Protocol</a>, <a href=\"https://www.silo.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Silo Finance</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pendle.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pendle Finance</a> as these protocols went from being under-utilized to a reasonable level of utilization.  This does not mean that similar risk outcomes would likely be observed should this growth start from a higher level.</p>\n<p>Chaos Labs recommends that the Arbitrum DAO stay vigilant, particularly where exposures are leveraged and composed of multiple protocol dependencies. To help ensure that risk management remains part of decision-making at all times, it is recommended to add a risk section to future incentive program application forms. This section should ask protocols to explicitly declare potential risks, cross-ecosystem dependencies and integrations, and a plan for mitigating these over the program.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"productive-incentive-attributes-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#productive-incentive-attributes-3\"></a>Productive Incentive Attributes</h1>\n<p>All three of the case studies examined grew their activity by multiple orders of magnitude, compared with an average TVL growth of 9.2% by STIP recipients. This presents us with many clear, actionable incentive strategies and tactics from the program for the Arbitrum DAO to learn from.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Experiment and Iterate:</strong> Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way.  This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2.  The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning.  There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:</strong> Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:</strong> This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Incentivizing Mercenary Behavior:</strong> Wash trading, sybils, and other inorganic activity is solely the result of incentives rewarding such activity and these strategies will be unwound as soon as the incentives end. There is no long-term benefit to incentives spent on these strategies as they are not retained after the program ends. Legitimate strategies earn fewer rewards as a result, and the program impact is diluted.  There was limited evidence of this in the case studies as activity was mainly subject to a small positive fee.<br>\n<strong>Use Incentives to Increase Integrations and Composability:</strong> Incentivizing the end use case was a powerful growth driver for growing the ecosystem of a protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:</strong> Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium.  This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal.  This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain Momentum with Native Incentives:</strong> If feasible, it is advisable to maintain momentum in the most impactful areas through protocol incentives once the incentive program ends. This strategy can better retain activity and position the application more favorably than others in its sector.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"potential-improvements-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#potential-improvements-4\"></a>Potential Improvements</h1>\n<p>Despite the positive STIP outcomes of the protocols analyzed, certain potential improvements were identified that could have made their use of incentives yield even greater results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Onboarding New Users Has the Greatest Positive Impact:</strong> This is easier said than done, given the general microstructure of DeFi.  It would be highly beneficial for applications running on Arbitrum and the Arbitrum ecosystem broadly for incentives to experiment with onboarding new users without getting exploited by sybils.</li>\n<li><strong>Aspire to Broaden the Incentive Distribution:</strong> Expanding on the previous point highlights that the wider the incentive effect, the more diverse and extensive the onboarded activity will be, leading to a healthier application marketplace. Exactly what determines the optimal distribution is application-specific, with different types of apps naturally growing different activity concentration microstructures.</li>\n<li><strong>Align Incentives with Ecosystem Goals:</strong> It does not make sense to grow elements of the Arbitrum ecosystem that are being deprecated over the long term. Bridged USDC.e growth is one element identified that grew as a result of these incentives and is being wound down, making it not an optimal area to target with incentives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The three case studies performed on Vertex Protocol, Silo Finance, and Pendle Finance provided many vital takeaways for Arbitrum DAO members and protocols to consider in future incentive programs.  This analysis covered the impact of the STIP program from a risk and efficiency standpoint.</p>\n<p>Although little consequence was observed due to risks manifesting, this can be attributed to market conditions at the program outset, and future iterations will likely play out differently.  We recommend close scrutiny of the potential for incentives to drive users too far along the risk curve, to the point where the ecosystem destabilizes.  Protocols should be asked to include a plan to contain the impacts of incentive-induced excessive risk-taking in their application forms going forward.</p>\n<p>Several consistent behaviors led to the success of these protocols’ incentive programs. The consistency of these behaviors, along with their overlap with traditional digital marketing strategies, gives us confidence in recommending their implementation in future incentive programs.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a brief list of incentive attributes that were not included but could have further enhanced the impact of these programs is provided. These elements are not straightforward or as evident as the positive aspects and should be considered as areas for future experimentation and improvement.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515","pubDate":"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 12:36:11 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25515"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515.rss","#text":"STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings"},"filter":false},{"title":"Arbitrum Universe Explorer: Mapping the Future of Blockchain Interoperability","dc:creator":"gokuplay2win","category":"General","description":"<p><strong>Introduction</strong> As you are aware, Arbitrum Orbit represents a Universe of Chains, an expansive ecosystem of interconnected blockchain networks.<br>\nOur proposal, <strong>The Arbitrum Universe Explorer</strong>, aims to bring this universe under one comprehensive visualization tool.

We want to take this opportunity to thank them for resolving potential issues in a quick and orderly manner. We would also like to thank the STIP &amp; STIP Bridge multi-sig committees for their invaluable assistance in navigating subjective areas pertaining to whether certain actions should be (or not be) deemed as misuse of funds.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is only a single project that failed to return funds to the DAO. We are left with no choice but to publicly share this information with the DAO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Furucombo (cc: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/blazar\">@Blazar</a>):\n<ul>\n<li>Furucombo has not published a final STIP report.</li>\n<li>It appears they sent the 59.5K ARB from the STIP to Kraken accounts, making it unclear how incentives were spent.</li>\n<li>Additionally, the project froze incentives towards ‘wash traders’, with users claiming they <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/furucombo-used-arbitrum-grants-to-incentivize-stealing-user-funds/23269/7\">received significantly fewer rewards than expected</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furucombo have notified us (and StableLabs) that the funds will be returned. However, after subsequent requests from us, the funds still remain in their possession.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps?</strong></p>\n<p>Furucombo will have 1 week to present their case to the ArbitrumDAO as a reply on this thread.</p>\n<p>If the project’s explanation is not to the Arbitrum Foundation’s satisfaction, and the funds (~59.5k ARB) are not returned within the same week, the Arbitrum Foundation will seek a vote from the ArbitrumDAO on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should Furucombo, including all founders, current team members, and affiliated contributors, be permanently banned from all future ArbitrumDAO programs?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is also an option, assuming Furucombo is banned from the ArbitrumDAO, for the Arbitrum Foundation to further enforce the grant agreement signed with Furucombo and seek legal recourse to return the funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>\n<p>The DAO is still young, and it is natural for it to learn with time and experience. Based on the incentive programs to date, here are some lessons that the Arbitrum Foundation have observed, that can hopefully be taken forward into future programs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Going forward, STIP rules should be more clearly defined on deadlines in which an incentive grant should be claimed by users and remaining funds to the ArbitrumDAO.</li>\n<li>Funds should be distributed from addresses that are solely used for incentive programs and projects should avoid commingled of funds. Put another way, it should be very straightforward to follow via on-chain transactions how the incentives are distributed.</li>\n<li>An incentive program should specify an authority, or a group of people, who are responsible for interpretation of the rules of the incentive program and whether a project has misused funds. To date, this responsibility has fallen on the appointed multisig, and the exact powers are not clear.</li>\n<li>All projects must be encouraged and required to report any change to their incentive program to the ArbitrumDAO. If there is a material change, it should require approval from an appropriate authority for the incentive program.</li>\n<li>On-chain analytic companies should be hired to help track the distribution of incentives in real-time. It may be wise to introduce tranches as opposed to simply streaming and further funds are only released if the protocol has carried out the will of their proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on the STIP Program, check out these resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/timeline-extension-for-stip-and-backfund-grantees/19819\">STIP Rules</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/92535731414466076465748260699234569033779695239254902723866669906112586724812\">STIP Proposal on Tally</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>6 posts -

But the answer will be as correct as possible only if we establish what growth looks like, and what we want to achieve in arbitrum in 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years. This is an open question for which there has never been a proper discussion; at the same time, i firmly believe we can’t just look for this answer and wait in the meantime due to the competitive landscape and how fast crypto is.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> work on short/mid/long term vision, in the meantime keep doing (at least some) incentives, and tailor when there is an answer.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Mostly unsolved: I personally don’t think we have ever analysed this properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> DAO wants to help good protocols.<br>\nThis can mean a lot of things. One interpretation is to either be more punitive with bad protocols, or rewards good ones, or both. But, beside malicious behaviours, it means tapping into previous question: when you know what you want arbitrum to be in 1/3/5/10 years, you can better understand which protocols are a driver. You also need proper way to measure protocols and data to literally read results.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> work on short/mid/long term vision + being able to monitor behaviour and analyse data to tailor incentive programs.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Same as previous problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> DAO wants to have easily digestible evaluation of programs and protocols.<br>\nThis translates in having an entity able to monitor data almost in real time, digest this data, present it in a way that is easy to understand. This also relies on the short/mid/long term vision you have, plus a normalisation of the data compared to the market (again: absolute numbers don’t mean anything).<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> work on short/mid/long term vision + data analysis entity/service provider at constant service of the DAO.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Partially done: we introduced data analysis entities (OBL, Blockworks), but we need a stronger mandate and a more robust method for the analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> DAO doesn’t want to throw money away.<br>\nThis is a generic statement, and to me still means understanding the cost of incentives vs the returns, either in metric or in assets. This could mean a few thing: understand KPI growth through alignment of programs with short/mid/long term vision + data analysis entity + constant monitoring of protocols, and potentially enable a fee sharing model with protocols, in which protocol share a portion of the excessive returns generated through the program. On top of this, a “sense check” on how much the DAO wants to spent per year.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> all of the previous + DAO budget with a bucket for incentives + profit sharing model between DAO and protocols.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Mostly unsolved: only now we are starting to talk about DAO budget, and we never look into profit sharing.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> DAO doesn’t want deliberate too much on single grants.<br>\nThis is about creating a mechanism in which there are important, informed decisions every 6 months / 1 year, in which the DAO relies on “experts” (service providers, elected people, others) and just comes when is time to evaluate data + a veto process on single entities.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> optimistic voting framework + an entity (council/advisors/others) constantly working with protocols.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Partially done: during STIP.b/LTIPP we used both the voting method and the council/advisors, but we definitely need to refine it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"protocols-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#protocols-2\"></a><strong>PROTOCOLS</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> protocols want to have more freedom in incentive usage.<br>\nThey need to be more agile in using grants, either cause competitive landscape changes or cause narrative changes or others. While the main north start so far has been using incentives for users, protocols also need to sometime rely on external service provider to properly operate. Mature protocols (—&gt; amount of participations in previous incentive programs for example) should have higher freedom in changing structure of incentives, tunnel up to a certain portion to third parties that are not users and others.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> a categorisation of protocols based on maturity levels, with promotions/retrocessions based on meaningful events (ie malicious behaviours + rubric aligned with short/mid/long term DAO goals) + data analysis. Potentially, different programs to which you can apply based on the criteria above.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Never discussed</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> protocols want to have less friction in applying/renewing.<br>\nThis is about having protocols not having to lose their time with infinite discussions, template and compiling data; or, at least, to have to do it once per year or when there are meaningful changes.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> incentive program with optimistic renewal (ie: 1 month duration, optimistic opt-in for 6 months as long as you have a virtuous behaviour backed by data).<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Never discussed</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> protocols want to have help to understand rules and establish mechanisms.<br>\nThis is about supporting programs constantly, not only during the draft of the proposals, in the lifecycle of the grant.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> supporting entity (council/advisors/others).<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Strangely at a decent point. Protocols were mostly happy about the new structure compared to stip 1 and backfund, but there is a lot of margin for improvement. And we definitely need way more people.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> protocols don’t want to have to negotiate every time to get in a program.<br>\nThis is about not having to do the same thing over and over (the goal of protocols is attracting users, not to fill the arbi forum) for the sake of doing it; even tho, partially, some compliance is and will always be required.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> optimistical opt-in, more streamlined KYC process and data process<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Only partially done with the optimistic vote, but a lot of margin for improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> protocols don’t want feel treated unevenly compared to peers and competitors.<br>\nThis is about have clear rules about who can participate to a program(s), why you might get rejected, and also knowing that even if you got rejected now there will be another possibility in a relative short term time (1 month?) to reapply + knowing what to do to reapply successfully.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> seasoned programs with very short cycles (1 month) and clear rules, plus support also after a rejection<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Never discussed, and we partially fumbled the bag during LTIPP on this, but we could solve it with better advisor/council/rubric structure.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"users-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#users-3\"></a><strong>USERS</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> users want to know what protocols have incentives and how to participates.<br>\nUsers want to have clear info on who will stream incentives, when they will start and end, what are the mechanisms. This doesn’t mean having to lurk in the obscure arbitrum forum and reading applications that are as long as an essay, but potentially have a central hub for info, updated, clear.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> central website, constantly updated, with all the info, + marketing around these initiatives.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Only partially done. We are moving to arbitrumgrants website, but we need a better structure. And we lack marketing, in general, in our DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> users don’t want to have their time wasted in participating in a protocol.<br>\nThis means that if, as a user, i take time to study the landscape, to try a protocol, with also a mechanism for incentives as per the description/proposal, I want to effectively have a result coherent with my expectations.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> a watchdog of the DAO able to analyse, in almost real time, if the mechanisms advertised by a protocol are effectively the one implemented<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Mostly unsolved: as of now we are analysing protocols’ behaviours post results. It likely requires a lot of time/energy/resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> users don’t want to jump from one protocol/chain to another to chase incentives.<br>\nThis means knowing that not only, as a user, i can be in arbitrum as my preferred chain, and use that protocol as my preferred one, but also know that incentives, even if in small amount, will always be streamed there (as long as that protocol is aligned with the ecosystem).<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> smaller but constant grant programs.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Never discussed.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p>I’ll stop here and leave with a list of possible solutions/improvements, knowing that this is not only a very subjective list, but also something that can be done in a single day or in a single program.

Currently, delegates lack a clear picture of the DAO’s financial status, and proposers are unclear about how their proposals impact finances. To ensure long-term sustainability and informed decision-making, insight into the current state of DAO spending is essential. This proposal does not aim to define a budget for the DAO treasury but to lay the groundwork for it.</p>\n<p>The final deliverable is an aggregated dashboard reflecting the spending of Arbitrum DAO in 2024 available for all via a public website similar to <a href=\"https://expenses.makerdao.network/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this expenses dashboard created for MakerDAO</a>. If there is interest around continuing the initiative, we will submit an additional proposal to extend the scope to maintain the dashboard.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The DAO lacks a unified view into its expenditures. This means that delegates must make decisions without a clear picture into the DAO’s current financial status. On the other side, proposers also have a lack of clarity on how their proposals impact DAO finances.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the DAO is sustainable over the long term and to be able to continue to fund important initiatives, the DAO needs insight into the current state of DAO spending.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a view into current spending is a prerequisite for creating an eventual budget for DAO spending (please note that defining a budget for the DAO treasury is out of scope for this proposal).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-5\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>We believe that an aggregated dashboard of financial data would enhance transparency into DAO finances. It would complement existing initiatives like the monthly R3gen Finance “Token Flow Report,” which provide financial reporting on a monthly basis. These reports are highly informative, presenting an overview of key facts and figures, inflows and outflows, treasury holdings, DAO initiatives, and more. As a complement, the DAO would also benefit from a historical perspective on this data. However, the information is presented in a static format and is not dynamic.</p>\n<p>Such a dashboard would not only complement existing initiatives like the monthly r3gen Finance reports, but also be directly helpful by saving time and providing data for these reports. Additionally, it will offer a dynamic and customizable view of the state of finances for DAO members. The added flexibility of an actively maintained dashboard would also allow for more rapid iteration in response to evolving DAO needs and feedback, and to incorporate new findings from efforts by the ARDC and other groups within the DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"powerhouse-decentralized-operations-platform-as-the-basis-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#powerhouse-decentralized-operations-platform-as-the-basis-7\"></a>Powerhouse Decentralized Operations Platform as the basis</h3>\n<p>We propose that <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Powerhouse</a> create the aggregated dashboard to track Arbitrum DAO spending.

This initiative aims to enhance brand recognition and community engagement by creating a strong, recognizable symbol representing Arbitrum’s identity and values.</p>\n<p>The mascot will be central to promoting Arbitrum’s brand, and the merchandise will serve as tangible representations of the community’s mission and values. This comprehensive project will be executed in multiple phases, including research, design, production, marketing, and distribution. By collaborating with web3 designers and community members, we aim to create a mascot that resonates with our audience and embodies the spirit of the Arbitrum blockchain.</p>\n<p>The merchandise will include high-quality items such as t-shirts, mugs, and plush toys, as well as innovative NFC-tagged products that generate collectible NFTs, integrating Arbitrum into both the physical and digital realms. Specifically, we plan to launch an online store similar to Big Shot and Nouns, where we will sell these mascot-themed products. The store will accept payments via Stripe and cryptocurrencies, making it accessible and convenient for the community.</p>\n<p>To kickstart this initiative, we will host a contest to design the mascot, offering a prize of 90k€. This will be followed by the production of 1000 high-quality stickers (15cm x 15cm), 200 plush toys (30cm high, 25€ each) with NFC tags and NFTs, and 200 high-quality t-shirts (10€ each).

The accelerator will launch 5-10 new bespoke high-quality meme coin projects in 6 months. These fair-launch projects are required to use ARB as currency to purchase meme coins and to use ARB in AMM liquidity pools.</p>\n<p>Motivation</p>\n<p>Currently, the ARB token has no other utility besides the governance function in the Arbitrum DAO. Clearly, more utilities created for ARB token will add lots of value to the Arbitrum community, which are illustrated in the most recent proposals: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-use-surplus-fees-to-align-governance/25084\">ARB Staking</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167\">Timeboost</a>.</p>\n<p>The invisible hand behind Solana’s huge success in meme coin is the economic engine where SOL is being used to purchase meme coins and being used/locked in the AMM LP pools - a new utility for SOL. It creates a virtuous cycle: meme coins generate new demands for SOL, which drives up the SOL price, which creates value to SOL holders who then deploy the profit back to meme coins.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum now has the infrastructure ready to replicate the SOL playbook, and by doing so, it will create a new utility for the ARB token, increase Aribitrum’s TVL, and supply new assets for Arbitrum’s DeFi. And to execute the vision, we need a catalyst. A meme coin accelerator is the catalyst to showcase the new utility of ARB and to start the flying wheel of the ARB economic virtuous cycle.</p>\n<p>Rationale</p>\n<p>This proposal contributes to Arbitrum Community Value by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure. In addition, supporting meme coins makes Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive.</p>\n<p>Specifications</p>\n<p>Meme coin projects are required to use ARB to purchase meme coins, especially any pre-sale, and use/lock ARB in the AMM LP pools.</p>\n<p>Meme coin creators will only need to focus on community, social &amp; marketing, and the accelerator will do the common work for these projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product &amp; engineering work on both smart contracts and front-end (done by Double)</li>\n<li>Liquidity support via Double and incentive distribution to capital providers (done by Double)</li>\n<li>BD with Arbitrum ecosystem projects especially DeFi projects (done by accelerator managers)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steps to Implement</p>\n<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves the proposal, then</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Searching and recruiting meme coin creators on a rolling basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design and develop the smart contracts and front-end products, and customize them for each project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch meme coins on a rolling basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Incentivize liquidity providing for each meme coin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conduct BD with Arbitrum ecosystem projects especially DeFi projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Timeline</p>\n<p>After getting on-chain approval and funding, complete the program in 6 months.</p>\n<p>Overall Cost</p>\n<p>The proposal requests total funding of $610k in ARB from Arbitrum DAO, which will be used to fund:</p>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1:</span> $270k on product &amp; engineering. 3 FTE@$15k/month for 6 months - 1 FTE on smart contract, 1 FTE on front-end, 1⁄2 FTE on designer, 1⁄2 FTE on product management.</p>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2:</span> $250k to incentivize liquidity providing for meme coins.</p>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3:</span> $90k for accelerator program management: 3 managers@$5k/month for 6 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Deck link:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://tome.app/vennity/memechain-copy-clyac13ot0vwqbvf1liaz1h6q\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://tome.app/vennity/memechain-copy-clyac13ot0vwqbvf1liaz1h6q</a></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-24-memebyosis-arbitrum-memecoin-accelerator/25390\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-24-memebyosis-arbitrum-memecoin-accelerator/25390","pubDate":"Sun, 07 Jul 2024 07:05:38 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25390"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-24-memebyosis-arbitrum-memecoin-accelerator/25390.rss","#text":"Team #24 - Memebyosis: Arbitrum Memecoin Accelerator"},"filter":false},{"title":"TEAM 20 - Local Hubs Working Group","dc:creator":"ostanescu.eth","category":"GovHack Brussels","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/188fcaea6eb67ce12c2623173c37004777c66a8f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3vhx59V2h57C7xYpoP9qOpUPEM7.png?dl=1\" title=\"TEAM 20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/188fcaea6eb67ce12c2623173c37004777c66a8f_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"TEAM 20\" data-base62-sha1=\"3vhx59V2h57C7xYpoP9qOpUPEM7\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/188fcaea6eb67ce12c2623173c37004777c66a8f_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/188fcaea6eb67ce12c2623173c37004777c66a8f_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/188fcaea6eb67ce12c2623173c37004777c66a8f_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"575E6B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Track Number:</strong> GovHack</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Track Name:</strong> Community / IRL Activation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Challenge Statement:</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The current lack of an easy onboarding system makes it challenging to incubate communities from various geographical localisations on Arbitrum, leading to fragmented outcomes across the ecosystem.

This proposal aims to further diversify the Arbitrum DAO treasury by including medium and high-risk profile assets, thereby reducing its dependence on the crypto-native asset, ARB.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>As of July 6th, we have observed that the Arbitrum DAO treasury consists of a total of 3,164,180,268 ARB and 13,943 ETH. This means that the Arbitrum DAO treasury is 97.9% dependent on ARB, a crypto-native asset. To prevent the DAO treasury from being affected by the inherent volatility of crypto-native assets, it is necessary to diversify the treasury. During this diversification, choosing products that provide real-world yields is ideal for reducing the treasury’s exposure to the price dynamics of the crypto market. Therefore, we should diversify the Arbitrum treasury through RWAs</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/ca6c56fa210aadca4878dc8f431375d78ee0df8a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sSIz5fSITqsTbOdEdeWLJP57b7Q.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/ca6c56fa210aadca4878dc8f431375d78ee0df8a_2_657x406.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"sSIz5fSITqsTbOdEdeWLJP57b7Q\" width=\"657\" height=\"406\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/ca6c56fa210aadca4878dc8f431375d78ee0df8a_2_657x406.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/ca6c56fa210aadca4878dc8f431375d78ee0df8a.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/ca6c56fa210aadca4878dc8f431375d78ee0df8a.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B4CDF8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: Arbiscan | <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf3fc178157fb3c87548baa86f9d24ba38e649b58\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARB Wallet</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xbfc1feca8b09a5c5d3effe7429ebe24b9c09ef58\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ETH Wallet<br>\n</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UV8ZjlWmRXGJr4XMrU3E3sUoa0MrdvKl67w7inHcf7M/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">In a report prepared by karpatkey</a> in January 2024, the value of the Arbitrum DAO treasury was stated to be $6,464,800,485.

Emphasizing the importance of diversification, it is crucial to focus on investing in low-risk asset classes within RWAs.</p>\n<p>For asset diversification that the Arbitrum Treasury could undertake in the near future, RWAs are significant as a yield/revenue tool outside the dynamics of the crypto market. RWAs offer a risk-manageable approach with different financial instruments, allow for diversification within the same asset class, enable both liquid and illiquid strategies, and provide a realistic risk environment for a long-term runway. Therefore, they could play an important role within the Arbitrum treasury.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"low-risk-rwa-yield-strategies-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#low-risk-rwa-yield-strategies-5\"></a>Low Risk RWA Yield Strategies:</h2>\n<p><strong>Stablecoins, US Treasury Bills and US Government Securities</strong></p>\n<p>1% of the Arbitrum Treasury will be allocated to protocol-based stablecoins, US Treasury Bills, and US Government Securities as the first step towards implementation and long-term sustainability of the Arbitrum Treasury.</p>\n<p>Starting with a bearish yield expectation of 4-5% APY, timelines can be determined based on the chosen method.

Detailed reports should be created on the risks and returns of RWA yield options categorized into three different levels: low, medium, and high risk. A public grant ($25K in ARB) should be established for this purpose, and the most competent research companies and organizations applying for the grant should be selected through on-chain voting.</li>\n<li>At the end of June, voting is underway on a recommendation by the STEP Committee to allocate $35M to low-risk assets, which are primarily composed of U.S. Treasury Bills, U.S. Government Securities, and the U.S. Dollar. This vote is currently receiving overwhelming support.</li>\n<li>If this vote is approved, $35M will be allocated to low-risk RWA products. This proposal aims to diversify the treasury by also allocating funds to medium- and high-risk RWA assets.</li>\n<li>Assuming $35M is allocated to low-risk assets, it is planned to enter a trial phase by allocating $15M to medium-risk assets and $5M to high-risk assets. If the targeted yields are successfully achieved with the allocated assets, another vote will be conducted to increase these amounts.</li>\n<li>The STEP Committee is expected to ensure the necessary organization of the program by working with relevant individuals in Legal Compliance and Partnerships. Partnerships need to be established with the providers of RWA assets identified through research. Additionally, throughout these processes, the Arbitrum Foundation and the STEP Committee should work closely together to determine whether the Arbitrum DAO can be recognized as a legal entity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-12\"></a>Timeline</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 1 (Research)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Share the grant program publicly on the Arbitrum Forum. Allow 2 weeks for researchers to apply to the program. Allocate 1 week for the STEP Committee to assess the qualifications of the applicants. Conduct a 1-week voting period for those who pass the qualification check. Considering potential delays, a total time frame of 5-6 weeks is required.</p>\n<p>Allow 4 weeks for the winning team to complete the research. In total, 9-10 weeks are needed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 2 (Legal Compliance)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>During these collaborations, depending on whether Arbitrum DAO has a legal entity or not, the Arbitrum Foundation may need to enter into some agreements.</p>\n<p>The STEP Committee will be responsible for examining the legal obligations necessary for this proposal. Since this committee is already managing the grant related to low-risk assets, they will also handle this task.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 3 (Business Development and Partnership)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When investing in RWA assets with Medium and High-Risk Profiles, the size of permissionless pools can be small and thus fully occupied. The Arbitrum DAO should form partnerships with intermediary projects for investing in RWA assets, enabling investments to be made directly through these partnerships.</p>\n<p>Partnership negotiations will be conducted by the STEP Committee on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO and are expected to take approximately 2-3 weeks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 4 (Medium Risk Profile Integration)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using the obtained research report, collaborate with projects that have a medium-risk profile and transfer the targeted $15M to RWA assets, sending them to the treasury’s wallet address.</p>\n<p>A time frame of 2-3 weeks is required for collaboration with two different organizations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 5 (High Risk Profile Integration)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there are no issues encountered during the diversification of the treasury with medium-risk assets, the planned $5M should also be transferred to high-risk assets. Additionally, the acquired RWA assets should be sent to the treasury’s wallet address.</p>\n<p>Similar to Milestone 4, a time frame of 2-3 weeks is required.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"overall-cost-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overall-cost-13\"></a>Overall Cost</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Research\n<ul>\n<li>$25K equivalent in ARB</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Medium Risk Profile RWA Assets Diversification\n<ul>\n<li>$15M equivalent in ARB</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>High Risk Profile RWA Assets Diversification\n<ul>\n<li>$5M equivalent in ARB</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>STEP Committee\n<ul>\n<li>$5K equivalent in ARB per member ($25K total)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Total Cost</strong>: $20.05M equivalent in ARB</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-17-arbitrum-dao-treasury-diversifying-through-rwa-assets/25384\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-17-arbitrum-dao-treasury-diversifying-through-rwa-assets/25384","pubDate":"Sun, 07 Jul 2024 06:41:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25384"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-17-arbitrum-dao-treasury-diversifying-through-rwa-assets/25384.rss","#text":"Team 17 - Arbitrum DAO Treasury Diversifying Through RWA Assets"},"filter":false},{"title":"Team 27 ArbitrumAgent: Empowering Decentralized Governance and Development with AI","dc:creator":"rblockchaindeveloper","category":"GovHack Brussels","description":"<h2><a name=\"title-arbitrumagent-empowering-decentralized-governance-and-development-with-ai-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#title-arbitrumagent-empowering-decentralized-governance-and-development-with-ai-1\"></a>Title: ArbitrumAgent: Empowering Decentralized Governance and Development with AI</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"track-ai-gov-tech-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#track-ai-gov-tech-2\"></a>Track: AI, Gov, Tech</h4>\n<h4><a name=\"group-27-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#group-27-3\"></a>Group: 27</h4>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-in-the-current-grant-approval-process-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#challenges-in-the-current-grant-approval-process-4\"></a>Challenges in the Current Grant Approval Process</h3>\n<p>Inconsistent Approvals: The unpredictable nature of grant approvals creates uncertainty and hampers community progress.</p>\n<p>Resource Drain: Manual approval processes consume significant team resources and energy, leading to reduced productivity.</p>\n<p>Missed Opportunities: The current system’s inefficiencies result in missed opportunities for valuable contributions to the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Loom Video: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/ed2cadf019af4916a39984aea8b9e818?sid=d75c7750-44b2-4677-a411-9171c55a01f0\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Empowering Decentralized Governance with AI in DAOs | Loom</a></p>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong><br>\nDevelop an intelligent agent, ArbitrumAgent, that automates the approval of micro-grants, provides specialized AI-driven assistance within the Arbitrum ecosystem, and enhances developer support and community engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br>\nArbitrumAgent is designed to revolutionize the way the Arbitrum ecosystem operates by leveraging AI and automation.
