We propose the inclusion of StakeUp’s stTBY, a stable asset backed by corporate debt overcollateralized by US Treasury Bills (T-Bills)–a scalable asset.</p>\n<p>Below I will describe why TBY and stTBY products are a suitable fit for DeFi and Arbitrums vision for STEP framework and could potentially offer a lower-risk profile compared to other stablecoins and on-chain US T-bills:</p>\n<p><strong>What is a TBY?</strong></p>\n<p>TBY, or Term Bound Yield, is a token issued by the Bloom protocol. It represents a fixed-income loan asset that is freely transferable and operates entirely on-chain. TBYs are designed to produce yields comparable to a 6-month U.S. Treasury Bill. They are unique because they offer accessibility to DeFi markets (permissionless) while maintaining a yield close or the same to traditional financial benchmarks. The yield is derived by commercial loan arrangements in which users lend USDC in a closed loop peer-to-pool model to a KYC borrower that is 102% overcollateralized with tokenized US treasuries. All collateral is held verifiably on-chain and debt is always repaid before the borrower realizes any return. Therefore, the TBYs have a similar economic risk profile to the underlying collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>Supporting Docs</strong><br>\nBloom: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation\">https://docs.bloom.garden/</a><br>\nTBY: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation\">https://docsend.com/view/ywukpt8kbqpg5m76/d/3kc3thbyrx48ku3z</a><br>\n<strong>Product Details</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gW4KSgml7oEKBsyO4SCD5Xt6EPK.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.22.16\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28_2_690x191.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.22.16\" data-base62-sha1=\"gW4KSgml7oEKBsyO4SCD5Xt6EPK\" width=\"690\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28_2_690x191.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28_2_1035x286.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ACACAC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b4e9e690793f32dab9cfb2ff7244d7f94cd30c2d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pOr4CmgOqEaU6JHC3z0wA6dxn7n.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.23.18\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b4e9e690793f32dab9cfb2ff7244d7f94cd30c2d.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.23.18\" data-base62-sha1=\"pOr4CmgOqEaU6JHC3z0wA6dxn7n\" width=\"690\" height=\"148\" data-dominant-color=\"A8A8A8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>The Underlying</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8a48e00c2ecd0f15cd2f719c4be3762800120363.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/jJk1zcL2xkTkB5ulB7PKr58S35N.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.24.00\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8a48e00c2ecd0f15cd2f719c4be3762800120363.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.24.00\" data-base62-sha1=\"jJk1zcL2xkTkB5ulB7PKr58S35N\" width=\"690\" height=\"152\" data-dominant-color=\"B0B0B0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>What is stTBY?</strong></p>\n<p>Staked TBY (stTBY) is a liquid yield vault for USDC, or a USDC LST, offered by the StakeUp protocol, and is pegged 1:1 to USDC.

Furthermore, CRR.D has a minimum investment size of $1, and is freely tradable and composable once minted.</p>\n<p>CRR.D is a debt product launched by the Chateau Capital team, an Arbitrum-native RWA platform that seeks to bring institutional-grade debt and equity instruments on-chain. We focus heavily on compliance and DeFi composability, to ensure that we are building a platform that is in line with Arbitrum’s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We are working directly with Hashnote which is a leader in the institutional DeFi space, with over 50 years of TradFi experience and tens of millions of $ in AUM. By bringing this product to the Arbitrum ecosystem, we also open the door for a deeper relationship between Hashnote and Arbitrum (currently they are focused on mainnet).</p>\n<p>There’s also 2 key aspects that we believe are worth emphasizing:</p>\n<p><strong>(i) Chateau is an Arbitrum-first platform.</strong> Unlike other projects that have chosen to prioritize other blockchains, the Chateau team is unapologetically focused on Arbitrum DeFi. Choosing Chateau as a service provider would send a strong signal to teams as to why they should focus on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>(ii) Chateau has a wider range of products than any other service providers.</strong> To truly drive more TVL via RWAs, Arbitrum must eventually expand beyond basic debt products. We have already launched Chateau Alternative Debt (CHAD.D) in partnership with Wall Street firm Covenant Venture Capital BVI. The product has a preferred return of 15% (averaging 18-21% since 2011) with no principal drawdown.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we will soon be launching private equity products including: OpenAI, Anthropic, MenloMicro, etc. We believe these RWA equity products will unlock massive demand that the current set of debt products cannot drive.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>Chateau Reverse Repo product (CRR.D) provides access to Hashnote’s Short Duration Yield Fund (USYC).</p>\n<p>Hashnote Short Duration Yield Fund invests in short-term U.S. Treasury Bills and performs repo / reverse repo activity as the underlying asset of the USYC token.</p>\n<p>USYC earns short-term risk-free rate returns. The fund benefits from the transaction speed, transparency, and composability of tokenization while eliminating virtually all of the protocol, custody, regulatory, and credit risks associated with other token projects.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor or similar rights?</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Regulatory oversight:</strong></p>\n<p>Please consult the Hashnote USYC application for appropriate response to this question.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Legal and Contractual structuring:</strong></p>\n<p>Please consult the Hashnote USYC application for more information on the legal structuring of iSDYF.  iSDYF investments are bankruptcy remote.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(i) Segregated Accounts:</strong></p>\n<p>Hashnote ensures that all assets invested in the USYC product are held in segregated accounts. This means that Arbitrum’s assets are kept separate from the assets of Hashnote and other investors, thereby safeguarding your investment in the event of a bankruptcy of the brokerage or financial institution.</p>\n<p><strong>(ii) Custodial Arrangements:</strong></p>\n<p>Hashnote partners with highly reputable custodians, such as BNY Mellon, to manage the custody of the assets. Additionally, Komainu provides custody support for USYC, offering elevated capital efficiency for institutions. These institutions are well-regulated and adhere to stringent financial standards, further reducing the risk of financial failure.</p>\n<p>Custodial Oversight: The custodians are subject to regular audits and regulatory oversight, ensuring that they maintain high levels of financial health and operational integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>Hashnote Reverse Repo USYC is managed separately from other assets. Please consult Hashnote’s USYC application for more information on the underlying assets.</p>\n<p>Chateau Capital has also launched the following assets on Arbitrum, with more equity listings in the pipeline:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.chateau.capital/app/debt/chateau-alternative-debt\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chateau Alternative Debt (CHAD.D)<br>\n</a><br>\nThere is no priority relationship between CHAD.D and CRR.D. Both assets have entirely separate smart contracts and SPVs set up that do not interact at all.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a detailed cash flow diagram that shows the flow of funds from ARB/Fiat conversion, investment in underlying asset, payment of expenses, sale of underlying asset, and repayment (Fiat/ARB conversion), including the counterparties and legal jurisdictions involved.</strong></p>\n<p>Please consult the Hashnote USYC application for information on subscription and redemption flows.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>The exact tax consequences depend on the tax jurisdiction of Arbitrum DAO and the legal entity making this investment</p>\n<p>When transacting in Hashnote’s USYC product and receiving yield, the anticipated tax consequences are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong>: If USYC tokens are sold at a profit, the gain may be subject to capital gains tax. The tax rate depends on the holding period: gains on tokens held for less than a year are taxed as short-term gains at ordinary income rates, while those held for longer are taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates, which range from 0% to 20% depending on your income.</p>\n<p><strong>Income from Yield:</strong> The yield generated from USYC, derived from investments in U.S. Treasury Bills and repo agreements, is treated as interest income, which is taxable at the federal level as ordinary income. However, interest from U.S. Treasury Bills is exempt from state and local taxes.</p>\n<p>Hashnote will generate the necessary tax forms for Arbitrum at the end of the year.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>Liquidation of CRR.D tokens into USDC can occur same day, or T+1 if the redemption request happens past 2pm EST cut off time.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p>Reverse Repos are the most liquid yield bearing asset in the world, as they represent overnight lending accounts at the Federal Reserve, and can be withdrawn daily unlike T-bills which carry a duration risk. They have essentially 0 stability risk, due to the Fed’s ability to issue currency infinitely. Please review Hashnote’s USYC application for more information on settlement and redemption.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>The main risks are:</p>\n<p>Smart Contract Risk for the ERC7540 CRR.D issuance contract and Hashnote USYC contracts.</p>\n<p>Chateau’s mitigations:<br>\ni. Audits with reputable firms for the contracts.<br>\nii. Using multisig wallets to custody funds and interact with the contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>13. Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps,OTC agreements)?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, CRR.D is built on Hashnote USYC.</p>\n<p>Hashnote is the premier on-chain institutional asset manager backed by the partners of DRW. Hashnote has an experienced in-house Fixed Income Team, with a track record of delivering consistent, risk-adjusted returns and liquidity management.</p>\n<p>The fund’s cash and securities are custodied at Bank of New York Mellon and managed by experienced portfolio and liquidity managers.

If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes it’s a permissioned infrastructure. We use a multi factor allowlisting process. Users have an onchain identity that spans factors such as location, type of investor, residence location, nationality location, AML/KYC flags etc… Investment assets</li>\n<li>We also have similar multifactor allow list indicating which locations they can be sold in, and what factors from an investor are allowed, then intent based protocol enables automated matching for immediate execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross chain interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>Libre share register is maintained on a permission sidechain and accessed through a web2 interface. The assets are then minted and locked on the mainnet through Libre Gateway.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The RWA tokens are not currently used in other protocols. However, the tokens will be used to build additional services and dApps such as collateralised lending, secondary market fund trading, and SMA portfolios. These services will be offered by Libre as well other partners on Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trusted parties like distributors and admins are setup through the “protocol council” who represent the protocol governance and consist of stakeholders in the protocol e.g., JV institutions and other parties on the network providing services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tokens have standard ERC-20 interfaces, especially the tokens that are locked on the Mainnets. We have internal logic that requires the asset and investors’ allowlists to be matched before a transaction intent is triggered and executed.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/librecapital-usd-money-market-a1-luma-step-application/23577\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/librecapital-usd-money-market-a1-luma-step-application/23577","pubDate":"Wed, 01 May 2024 23:50:39 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23577"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/librecapital-usd-money-market-a1-luma-step-application/23577.rss","#text":"LibreCapital USD Money Market A1 (LUMA) STEP Application"},"filter":false},{"title":"[Perennial] STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"lewi","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h3><a name=\"original-stip-application-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#original-stip-application-1\"></a>Original STIP Application</h3>\n<p>Our STIP proposal can be seen here:</p><aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"17388\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/lewi/48/3395_2.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/perennial-finance-final-stip-round-1/17388\">[Perennial Finance] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]</a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/incentive-framework/14\"><span data-category-id=\"14\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #000000; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF; --parent-category-badge-color: #25AAE2;\" data-parent-category-id=\"16\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category --has-parent\"><span class=\"badge-category__name\">Incentive Framework (Round 1)</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    <a name=\"section-1-applicant-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#section-1-applicant-information-1\"></a>SECTION 1: APPLICANT INFORMATION\n<a name=\"h-624x208uploadstrkektflxenm6mtcwtohigevghpng-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-624x208uploadstrkektflxenm6mtcwtohigevghpng-2\"></a><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/ca813b459adc9402b2f349487801c70f5c265363.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sTrkektfLxenM6mtcwTohigevGH.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[image]</a>\nApplicant Name: lewi \nProject Name: Perennial Finance \nProject Description: Perennial is an on-chain derivatives protocol built from first principles to be a DeFi primitive.

As with any direct to consumer grants program, a number of factors can affect the results of the applied incentives. Guided by our KPIs and the overarching KPIs, we modified the allocation of the STIP rewards almost each epoch.</p>\n<p>The STIP program coincided with the launch of Perennial’s V2. This offered an opportunity to see its new mechanism in action. We saw makers take advantage of native leverage over the length of the program with Total Available Liquidity peaking at a multiple of 4.9x the TVL in the protocol. This efficiency is key to providing traders the best liquidity to trade with &amp; offer sophisticated makers greater capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>We found that applying incentives on newer markets helped de-risk them for makers and allowed us to experiment with new payoffs and price feeds. We’ll aim to continue this approach in the STIP bridge as it helps bring diversity to the Arbitrum perps landscape. Another learning was that OI rewards are a fickle tool that can attract mercenary capital. We experimented for two weeks and then removed them in favor of more sustainable mechanisms or subsidies.</p>\n<p>A key outcome was de-risking the unique protocol design of Perennial V2 to building inside and outside the ecosystem. We aimed to bring dev teams to Arbitrum and the STIP has helped us secure a number of key partnerships with teams like Kwenta (Optimism).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-7\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: In parallel to this STIP Bridge proposal, Perennial has a stand alone proposal to the DAO with Kwenta to build an incentives package to best support their launch on Arbitrum.

Its permissionless fashion allows its holders to trade and utilize the coin without restrictions, besides interacting with US holders and other sanctioned jurisdictions (see <a href=\"https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/legal/terms-and-conditions\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Terms and Conditions</a>). Mountain Protocol Limited is a prudentially regulated entity by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (License <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#202302512</span>), safeguarding holders rights.</p>\n<p>All USDM is backed by short-term Treasury Bills, with an average maturity of 60 days, and with an overcollateralization rate of ~5%. USDM has 1:1 mint and redemption capacity for USDC and USD. There are no mint nor redemption fees. All these imply a very low market and protocol risk, securing a coin pegged to $1 with costs reduced to minimum.</p>\n<p>USDM supports Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem by providing a very low risk building block that can be composed easily by virtue of being a permissionless ERC20. Examples of this are the existing USDM/USDC Curve pools and the upcoming USDM/hnUSD, wUSDM/wstETH, and wUSDM/Grai pools, as well as the usage of USDM for SOFR interest rate swaps (by IPOR) and the usage of USDM as collateral on derivative protocols (by HMX and AARK).</p>\n<p>USDM has also been approved by the BMA, the largest global reinsurance regulator, for usage as collateral for insurance policies via Nayms for a Florida Hurricane policy. This is a case example of USDM enabling real world use cases of crypto in regulated industries.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

This resulted in a scenario where the increase in TVL to the Jones protocol was greater than the ARB amount distributed for the vast amount of time during the campaign.</p>\n<p>Alongside new deposits, incentivized Jones strategies such as jGLP grew in market value. For users, this was a great outcome as they received rewards from one of the most simple campaigns around, while being able to capture the effects of an upward-trending market, which provided them an incredible STIP experience!</p>\n<p><strong>6. [Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the lessons we learned from STIP is that, to amplify success, we need to foster more cooperation and collaboration with partners ahead of STIP campaign launch. One of the campaigns we wished had a stronger presence was our campaign for wjAURA. While the rewards for wjAURA on Arbitrum were great, we did not see as much composability &amp; cooperation from partners as we would have liked, and the utility of this product on the new chain (the result of a migration from ETH Mainnet to Arbitrum) didn’t grow as much as we wanted. This resulted in the lion’s share of rewards being absorbed by whales with a large wjAURA presence on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We were not unhappy with the campaign, since the overall number of users and TVL of the jAURA strategy increased, but we want to make sure people are staying with the protocol and more importantly, staying on Arbitrum. This is why we think that downsizing the relative % amount of rewards, plus targeting Arbitrum ecosystem integrations over the product itself, could be a way to have more capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Another lesson would be to focus more on retention after the conclusion of our campaign.</p>\n<p>For jGLP, we experienced a decrease in TVL after the STIP campaign concluded. By studying the top wallets holding jGLP, and by interviewing some of our user base, we can confidently assert that the new tokens stayed within the Arbitrum ecosystem, and specifically stayed in the GMX ecosystem, where they migrated to GMX V2 after rewards ceased. We hope that by launching a brand new incentives campaign centered around our new GMX V2 vault strategy, we will bring many of those users back to Jones and keep them satisfied for the long term, increasing the retention rate. Better performance in retaining TVL after the end of this iteration of the program would mean a marked improvement in the performance of our campaign.</p>\n<p>Finally, in our initial STIP campaign, we wanted to deploy a portion of the incentives towards our new product, jLP. jLP is a concentrated liquidity manager that is highly composable, with specific innovations that give it the Jones ‘touch’. We effectively released jLP in a beta state (labeled under “Jones Lab”) to gather initial feedback from users in terms of overall experience. After gathering this feedback and gathering data, we were not satisfied that the results produced were suitable for a STIP campaign that would provide enough value to users. As a consequence, we have been working for the last 4 months on the underlying infrastructure to be able to achieve the functionalities mentioned above as well as others beyond that scope. This time, we plan to utilize a portion of the STIP rewards to bootstrap this new revamped product.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7. How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>1M ARB (50% of the original STIP amount)</p>\n<p><strong>8. Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal? [Y/N]</strong></p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>9. [Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>We plan to allocate as following:</p>\n<p><strong>Partners Building on wjAURA:</strong> 0% - 12.5% (target: 10%)</p>\n<p>Users will be incentivised towards locking their wjAURA with partners (Isekai for example), that will effectively indefinitely lock the deposited wjAURA on Arbitrum. This guarantees a constant utility &amp; presence on Arbitrum for a product born on Ethereum Mainnet.</p>\n<p><strong>New Tokenomics:</strong> 0% - 12.5% (target: 10%)</p>\n<p>Jones will release a new token format with a gamified mechanism for locking and redeeming tokens, alongside the ability to participate in strategic token purchases derived from protocol revenue. ARB rewards will be used to incentivise the conversion and locking of JONES tokens. This product is currently in audit and should be released during May.</p>\n<p><strong>For the jGM/jUSDC Ecosystem:</strong> 30% - 80% (target: 45%)</p>\n<p>ARB tokens for the jGM/jUSDC ecosystem are expected to be distributed in three parts. On one side to incentivise deposits and boost jUSDC APR, on another to bootstrap and boost jGM APR, and the last for partners who could offer integrations such as lending &amp; borrowing markets on top of these strategies (ie: Dolomite for example).</p>\n<p>The split between jGM, jUSDC, and partners will be established on a week to week basis, since these strategies may receive yield boosts that will potentially be subject to other incentives placed on top by integrators. jGM will allow people to enjoy a product similar in structure to jGLP, in which a basket of GM tokens (gmETH, gmBTC, gmARB, gmSOL, among others) will be leveraged and algorithmically balanced against the borrowed USDC tokens provided by the jUSDC vault, which will enjoy a portion of the yield generated by jGM. jGM is currently in audit and should be released during May</p>\n<p><strong>For the jLP Ecosystem:</strong> 0% - 45% (target: 35%)</p>\n<p>As highlighted above in section 6, jLP will be the full iteration of our current Jones Labs automated V3 liquidity strategy offering, which is currently open to users. The vaults will have new innovations like: bull / bear / neutral strategies, limit / exit orders, and other functionalities that are not available in other products which will be announced on launch. The revamped infrastructure is currently going through audit and should be released during the first half of the STIP bridge.</p>\n<p>We will also attempt to coordinate with partners, especially lenders, to be able to spin up composable utility for the vault tokens right away. We plan to support of Uniswap and Camelot from day 1 (Camelot already publicly supported, Uniswap supported on our backend), and to open vaults specifically for blue chip pairs (ie: ARBETH, ETHUSDC) and other native arbitrum coins, with neutral(s), bull, and bear strategies available at launch.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution Strategy:</strong><br>\nOur strategy relies not only on products that we are confident will be released within the specified timeline, but also agreements with partners which may require development of some infrastructure. This is the reason why we have provided specific ranges and why, in general, we want to reserve the right to redirect any or all of the incentives outlined towards certain subsets of products to others. Accordingly, not only market conditions but also the agreements of aforementioned partners may have an impact.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>jUSDC: 0xB0BDE111812EAC913b392D80D51966eC977bE3A2 - This contract was recently re-deployed as a result of upgrades made to jUSDC that enabled the addition of the jGM strategy.</p>\n<p>jGM: TBD</p>\n<p>wjAURA OFT (Arbitrum): 0xcB9295ac65De60373A25C18d2044D517ed5da8A9</p>\n<p>jLP: TBD</p>\n<p><strong>11. Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<p>We think looking at ecosystems like Optimism &amp; Uniswap, with fleshed out governance models, would be great for the Arbitrum DAO team to take some notes from. Arbitrum is a different DAO: likely the most decentralized available and also the one with the highest amount of participation. For this reason, the goal is not to copy, but to iterate and improve on what they have already done.</p>\n<p>In terms of support via official tracking sites, it would be very attractive to see in-house versions of the 3rd-party information that was shared by the community during the lead up to STIP Round 1. These information spreadsheets and sites covered things such as: how much ARB each protocol was asking for, which protocols passed quorum, and which protocols were likely to receive their grants. A centralized hub for info on the incentive program, and if possible on all incentive programs, would be immensely helpful for transparency and project discovery.</p>\n<p>Learning from other ecosystems and implementing official tracking tools will make it easier for the DAO to help Arbitrum grow and create opportunities for protocols &amp; users to attract more attention to the chain by word-of-mouth or targeted marketing.</p>\n<p>Finally, having measurement metrics that take into account what has happened on Arbitrum, and more specifically protocols on Arbitrum, normalized for what has also happened in the market, would be a good way to properly understand the effectiveness of these programs.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/jones-stip-addendum/23570\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/jones-stip-addendum/23570","pubDate":"Wed, 01 May 2024 21:22:08 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23570"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/jones-stip-addendum/23570.rss","#text":"Jones STIP Addendum"},"filter":false},{"title":"OpenEden $TBILL STEP Application","dc:creator":"OpenEdenLabs","category":"STEP Applications","description":"<h1><a name=\"applicant-information-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#applicant-information-1\"></a>Applicant information</h1>\n<p><strong>Name</strong>: OpenEden Group<br>\n<strong>Address (Headquarters)</strong>: 1 Kim Seng Promenade <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#11-01</span> Great World City<br>\n<strong>City, State, Postal Code</strong>: Singapore, 237994<br>\n<strong>Country</strong>: Singapore<br>\n<strong>Website</strong>: <a href=\"https://openeden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://openeden.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Primary contact</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Name</strong>: Jeremy Ng<br>\n<strong>Title</strong>: Co-Founder<br>\n<strong>Country</strong>: Singapore<br>\n<strong>Email</strong>: <a href=\"mailto:jeremy.ng@openeden.com\">jeremy.ng@openeden.com</a><br>\n<strong>Telegram</strong>: <span class=\"mention\">@ly3333</span><br>\n<strong>Forum</strong>: OpenEdenLabs</p>\n<h1><a name=\"executive-summary-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#executive-summary-2\"></a>Executive Summary</h1>\n<p><em><strong>The First Native On-chain TBILL Vault with Arbitrum as a Core Focus</strong></em><br>\nThe OpenEden Tokenised U.S. Treasury Bill Fund (“TBILL Fund” or “Fund” or “Token Issuer”) is the first regulated U.S Treasury Bills Fund that is offered 24/7/365 on-chain through the <a href=\"https://app.openeden.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenEden TBILL Vault</a> (“OE TBILL Vault”). The OETBILL Vault is deployed natively on Arbitrum and Ethereum offering a DeFI UI/UX while offering the most institutional-grade and compliant access to U.S. Treasury Bills (“T-Bills”) yield on-chain. Having launched the Fund in April 2023, The TBILL Fund has a 1 year live track record which ranks amongst the longest in the market. Being the only on-chain native vault that utilises smart-contract technologies for settlement, there is much resources and planning from the team to deploy on Arbitrum natively, thereby showcasing the clear commitment to the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p><em><strong>A Robust Regulatory-First Approach for a Global Audience</strong></em><br>\nOpenEden’s TBILL tokens (“$TBILL”) are issued by The TBILL Fund, which is a British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission (“BVIFSC”) regulated professional fund established under the British Virgin Islands Securities and Investment Business Act 2010. The bankruptcy-remote TBILL Fund is managed by OpenEden’s affiliated entity, which is a Registered Fund Management Company regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). The investment manager of the TBILL Fund operates under an investment mandate to invest in short-dated T-Bills. $TBILL tokens of the Fund can be offered to Non-U.S Professional Investors defined under BVI SIBA Act and to U.S Accredited Investors defined under U.S Securities Act of 1993 Rule 501a (the Fund had filed SEC Form D Notice to offer under Reg D 506c)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Truly Crypto-native, Transparent and 24/7/365 Real-time Access</strong></em><br>\n$TBILL tokens can be minted instantly 24/7/365 on-chain via the OETBILL Vault using USDC, and $TBILL tokens are held in the investor’s self-custodial wallet. The OE TBILL Vault is currently the market’s only platform that offers real-time, instant on-chain minting of T-Bill backed tokens, thus removing settlement risks and allowing investors to earn yield from the point of minting till the point of redemption, maximising capital efficiency.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Institutional-grade Foundation with Best-in-Class Partners</strong></em><br>\nThe TBILL Fund’s portfolio of T-Bills are bought, sold and custodised through the Fund’s licensed Prime Broker, UK FCA registered StoneX Financial Limited, and custodised in the Prime Broker’s licensed sub-custodian, being BNP Paribas Bank, New York in segregated accounts. As the Token Issuer is a regulated fund managed by a regulated fund manager, there are stringent regulatory requirements including the appointment of an independent fund administrator to (i) provide independent daily valuation of the $TBILL token’s NAV; and (ii) participate as an independent multi-sig party for all fund asset transfer transactions as an additional safeguard against fraud. The Fund has also appointed KPMG as its tax advisor and is subject to annual audits on its balance sheet and financials. Ernst &amp; Young has also recently completed an independent audit on the OE TBILL Vault’s critical processes and controls in relation to the TBILL Fund’s KYC procedures, valuation methodologies and the Fund’s asset transfer and custody procedures and controls. OpenEden is proud to have achieved a satisfactory audit report with no critical or high risk findings.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-information-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-information-3\"></a>Key Information</h1>\n<p><strong>1.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong><br>\nFrom a treasury management perspective, the investment into the TBILL Fund via the OE TBILL Vault will provide healthy asset diversification for the Arbitrum treasury which is currently primarily held in Arbitrum native tokens. U.S. T-Bills are considered one of the safest assets in global markets being backed by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. Federal Government, and will only default when the U.S. government defaults, and currently provide a risk-free yield of over 5%. U.S. Treasury Bills are one of the least volatile asset classes in the world and are uncorrelated to the ARB token’s price. This diversification reduces the volatility of the Arbitrum treasury’s portfolio and aligns with the goal of capital preservation and increasing risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>From an ecosystem perspective, investment into native RWA projects on the ecosystem, such as the OpenEden Arbitrum TBILL Vault, shows the Arbitrum foundation’s support and commitment towards driving the growth of the RWA sector on the Arbitrum network. This would instil confidence in the overall RWA sector on Arbitrum and boost participation in RWA projects from different groups of stakeholders on the network. Ultimately, OpenEden’s goal is for Arbitrum to become one of the leading blockchain ecosystems for RWA projects in terms of TVL, composability, utility and activity.</p>\n<p>OpenEden is committed to allocating incentives to users of its products launched natively on Arbitrum, aiding in evangelising and promoting greater adoption for the Arbitrum RWA ecosystem. We are already in several conversations with key projects and stakeholders of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. Even in our future product roadmap, we are already in deep discussions with some Arbitrum-native projects in partnering our second product. Further, from OpenEden’s network of partners, we are also promoting the alignment to Arbitrum and this gives us the potential to aid in cross-sell.</p>\n<p>We are truly Arbitrum-aligned given how we have selected Arbitrum ahead of several other blockchains because we firmly believe in what Arbitrum stands for (“Home for DeFi”) and in its superior traits over its current peers. The amount of resources being utilizied to build the first native on-chain vault on Arbitrum with smart contract technology for settlement cannot be understated.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Has your entity or its officers/key contributors been subject to an enforcement action, criminal action, or defaulted on legal or financial obligations? Please describe the circumstances if so.</strong><br>\nNo.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Describe any conflicts of interest for your entity and key personnel.</strong><br>\nThere are no unmitigated conflicts of interest. The Fund has engaged OpenEden Labs (“OEL”) and Adam Eve Capital (“AEC”), both of which are wholly owned Group entities, as technology service provider and investment manager respectively. There has been disclosure of such arrangements in the Fund’s offering documents and the relevant service contracts, investment management agreements and conflicts of interest policies in place. To mitigate operational risks of such conflicts, a third party fund administrator has been appointed by the Fund to serve as an independent multi-signature approver in relation to approving the whitelisting of addresses and transfers between whitelisted wallet addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Insurance coverages, guarantees, and backstops</strong><br>\nOpenEden has assessed the risks of loss in the context of its issuance of $TBILL and has determined that obtaining insurance coverage is not required due to the legal structuring and technical capabilities of the Fund, OE TBILL Vault and $TBILL.</p>\n<p>The Fund is a regulated BVI professional fund which is managed by AEC, a MAS regulated fund management company. AEC and the Fund are subject to strict requirements from their respective regulatory bodies with respect to the independent custody of the Fund’s assets, which underpin the $TBILL token. Ernst &amp; Young has also recently completed an independent audit on the OE TBILL Vault’s critical processes and controls in relation to the Fund’s KYC procedures, valuation methodologies and the Fund’s asset transfer and custody procedures and controls. OpenEden is proud to have achieved a satisfactory audit report with no critical or high risk findings, demonstrating that the Fund has in place good risk control against fraud and mishandling of assets which could potentially cause losses to the $TBILL holders.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s investment mandate also limits the Fund’s portfolio to containing only short-term US Government Treasuries (ie. less than 6 month maturity with the current portfolio’s weighted average maturity being less than 50 days), ensuring that the Fund’s assets are liquid. $TBILL holders also have priority over the Fund’s management shareholders in the event of a distribution of the Fund’s assets by way of a legally enforceable subordination deed.</p>\n<p>The Fund’s underlying US Government Treasury assets as well as a small amount of USD are also held in segregated accounts with regulated custodians appointed by the Fund, currently UK FCA registered StoneX Financial Limited, with sub-custody handled by BNP Paribas New York. This reduces the risk of loss of the Fund’s underlying assets which back the $TBILL’s NAV through blockchain related hacks or exploits.</p>\n<p>The $TBILL itself cannot be transferred to non-whitelisted wallets, the process of which is safeguarded by multi-signature approval process involving independent third party signatories. The OE TBILL Vault also has the technical capability to respond to potential hacks/losses suffered by $TBILL holders by cancelling stolen/misappropriated $TBILLs and re-issuing them to affected $TBILL holders.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Historical tracking error in your proposed product, or similar to that being proposed product</strong><br>\nNone. There is no tracking error because the $TBILL is backed by directly held U.S. Treasury Bills. OpenEden uses live market data provided by London Stock Exchange Group (“LSEG”) to provide 24/7 live price of the $TBILL, which is the reflection of the NAV of the Fund.

Brief reason for above tracking error</strong><br>\nNot applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Please describe any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organizational structures</strong><br>\nWhile the OpenEden team has not had prior experience working directly with decentralized organisational structures, we are strongly committed to support DAO communities and to provide high-quality treasury management services. Our Co-Founder Eugene has been investing and supporting crypto-native projects since 2017, and his HFT firm DWF Labs has since amassed more than 700 crypto projects with a number of DAO foundations. Through his extensive network of crypto-native connections, he would be able to bring much value and expertise in any formal DAO engagement. He was also a core member of a relatively small DAO called DAOvergence.</p>\n<p>OpenEden has onboarded multiple DAOs as users and thus is familiar and comfortable working with the often unique structures associated with DAOs.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What is your entity’s current assets under management, assets held in trust, total value locked, or equivalent metric for your legal structuring?</strong><br>\nThe total value locked (“TVL”) of the $TBILL is currently approximately US$30,971,129 (as of 30 April 2024).</p>\n<p><strong>11. How many of these assets held are present on Arbitrum One, if any?</strong><br>\nThe current TVL of the $TBILL held on Arbitrum is US$308,920 (as of 30 April 2024). The OpenEden Arbitrum TBILL Vault was officially launched in March 2024 and we expect TVL to increase on Arbitrum as we establish more partnerships with Defi Protocols within the ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"plan-design-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#plan-design-5\"></a>Plan design</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Product : OpenEden $TBILL</strong><br>\nAs previously explained above in this RFP, the issuer of the $TBILL, being the TBILL Fund, is a registered professional fund (“Fund”) established under the British Virgin Islands Securities and Investment Business Act 2010 (“SIBA”) and regulated by the BVIFSC. The TBILL Fund is managed by AEC (as defined above), a wholly owned subsidiary of the OpenEden Group, which operates as a registered fund management company under MAS supervision. The TBILL Fund operates the OE TBILL Vault, a smart contract vault that provides investors with direct exposure to a pool of short-dated U.S. T-Bills and overnight reverse repurchase agreements through the minting of the $TBILL. The $TBILL is backed 1:1 by short-dated U.S. T-Bills and a small portion of U.S. Dollar (“USD”) held in bankruptcy remote segregated accounts in the Fund’s name. $TBILLs can be minted instantly 24/7/365, allowing investors to earn yield backed by the U.S. government on their USDC subscription at the point-of-mint itself, rather than having to wait up to T+2 business days as compared to traditional funds.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault operates on a zero-trust protocol, ensuring that all transactions are fully atomic, automated, transparent and managed on-chain without manual intervention. The protocol smart contract dictates that $TBILL can only be minted in the presence of the underlying asset, USDC, thus ensuring each token is always backed by actual assets. This minimises reliance on trust, making our system more secure and transparent than traditional incumbents. The OE TBILL Vault does not have the capability to freely mint tokens, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised token creation.</p>\n<p>The OE TBILL Vault is a permissioned protocol, which means that an investor has to meet specific criteria before the investor is eligible to hold $TBILL issued by the Fund. The OE TBILL Vault is currently only accessible to “Professional Investors’’ as defined under SIBA and to U.S. “Accredited Investors’’ within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act. $TBILL can only be minted and redeemed via the OE TBILL Vault by whitelisted wallets that have been fully onboarded after completing the Fund’s KYC/KYB process. As a permissioned token, $TBILL are transferable between whitelisted wallets.</p>\n<p>The $TBILL is an EIP-20-compliant representation of an investor’s economic interest in the Fund. By depositing USDC and minting $TBILL, the investor will have legal rights to the redemption value of the net assets held by the Fund, proportional to the amount of $TBILL the investor holds relative to the total outstanding supply of $TBILL. The $TBILL minted by the investor are held in the investor’s whitelisted self custodial wallet.</p>\n<p>Whitelisted investors are also provided with access to the investor dashboard visible on the OE TBILL Vault dApp. The dashboard provides the investor with a real-time view of their $TBILL balance and their realised and unrealised P/L. Please find the sample screenshot of the investor dashboard displayed below.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/5833ea409ddfff4837a58a4f4a7fc1718dec618c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/cAhfbjg265O5W5LPRbyzZYuOasc.png?dl=1\" title=\"investor_dashboard\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/5833ea409ddfff4837a58a4f4a7fc1718dec618c_2_603x500.png\" alt=\"investor_dashboard\" data-base62-sha1=\"cAhfbjg265O5W5LPRbyzZYuOasc\" width=\"603\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/5833ea409ddfff4837a58a4f4a7fc1718dec618c_2_603x500.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/5833ea409ddfff4837a58a4f4a7fc1718dec618c_2_904x750.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/5833ea409ddfff4837a58a4f4a7fc1718dec618c_2_1206x1000.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F8FAF9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Investment strategy</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund aims to provide the highest possible level of income generation while maintaining liquidity and maximum safety of principal.

The Certificate of Recognition will be will be provided via private email.</p>\n<p>The investment manager of the Fund, being AEC, is a registered fund management company incorporated in Singapore and regulated by the MAS.</p>\n<p>As a regulatory requirement for registered professional funds, the Fund has to lodge a Private Placement Memorandum and Subscription/Redemption Agreement with the BVIFSC that documents all the contractual rights of $TBILL holders. The Fund also has to notify the BVIFSC of any appointments of service providers to the Fund.</p>\n<p>Every tokenholder has legal and contractual rights to the redemption value of the net assets held by the Fund, proportional to the amount of $TBILL the investor holds relative to the total outstanding supply of $TBILL.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong><br>\nYes, the Fund’s assets are segregated from the OpenEden Group companies, chiefly AEC (the investment manager), OEL (the technology service provider). . No operational capital of AEC or OEL are commingled with the Fund’s assets.</p>\n<p>As per relevant regulatory requirements, the Fund holds its assets with independent and regulated custodians and/or institutions in its own name and not in the name of any other OpenEden Group entity, ensuring proper segregation of assets from the operating accounts of the Fund Manager and Technology Service Provider. Digital wallet transfers from wallets held with licensed custodians are also subject to independent third-party multi-signatory approval from the Fund’s fund administrator to ensure additional control over the Fund’s assets.</p>\n<p>Each $TBILL holder’s rights are set out in the Fund’s offering documentation and they have legal and contractual rights to the net redemption value of the underlying assets held by the Fund, and such rights/claims are ranked ahead of the management shareholders of the Fund via a legally enforceable subordination deed. Management shareholders do not have economic participation rights to the underlying assets held by the Fund. All terms are documented in the Private Placement Memorandum (provided in Supplementary documents section).</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong><br>\nThe following excerpts are extracted from StoneX Financial Limited’s custody services contract with the Fund.</p>\n<p><em>Any securities which StoneX holds as safe custody assets for their clients will be deposited via their sub-custodian network. The sub-custodian(s) which StoneX use and their credit ratings are identified in the following table:</em></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Sub-custodian</th>\n<th>Standard &amp; Poor’s Rating</th>\n<th>Moody’s Rating</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>BNP Paribas S.A</td>\n<td>A+ as of 25th April 2022</td>\n<td>Aa3 as of 5th July 2022</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><em>Under the terms of the custody agreement(s) with StoneX’s sub-custodian(s), each sub-custodian will segregate in its books and registers any clients’ safe custody assets from their own securities. StoneX’s sub-custodian(s) will not have security or similar rights enabling it to dispose of clients’ safe custody assets except to satisfy obligations incurred by clients, or for payment for services related to the clients’ safe custody assets, meaning that clients’ safe custody assets will not be commingled with StoneX’s assets or exposed to the performance of StoneX’s assets.</em><br>\n<em>In providing the custody service, StoneX is subject to the oversight and supervision of its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. The arrangements which StoneX has put in place with its sub-custodian(s) give effect, in particular, to the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority’s CASS Sourcebook, under which StoneX has a regulatory obligation to ensure that any clients’ safe custody assets deposited with a sub-custodian are identifiable separately from its own assets and from the assets of its sub-custodian(s), for the purpose of ring-fencing clients’ assets in order to safeguard their ownership rights.</em></p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong><br>\nNo. The TBILL Fund Only issues $TBILL as a digital representation of the holder’s investment into the TBILL Fund. The TBILL Fund does not and will not be used to issue other products.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a detailed cash flow diagram that shows the flow of funds from ARB/Fiat conversion, investment in underlying asset, payment of expenses, sale of underlying asset, and repayment (Fiat/ARB conversion), including the counterparties and legal jurisdictions involved.</strong><br>\nIt is our understanding that the Arbitrum Foundation will be swapping ARB token into USDC (ARB) before depositing into OE TBILL Arbitrum Vault. Should the Foundation choose to deposit through the TBILL Ethereum Vault, the process is similar as well. The screenshot of the TBILL dAPP below shows how the Foundation can deposit USDC to mint $TBILL.

Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong><br>\nU.S. T-Bills trade more than $100 billion on a daily basis and is the world’s most liquid asset. It trades almost 24 hours a day on US business days from Tokyo 8am open to New York 5pm close. T-Bills can be traded (buy and sell) with same day settlement, therefore the Fund expects to process redemption within T+1 US business days.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong><br>\nIn managing blockchain-derived risks, OpenEden adheres to stringent security protocols, particularly concerning our smart contract operations. Prior to any deployment or upgrade of smart contracts, we mandate comprehensive audits conducted by third-party security firms. These audits are essential to identify and rectify vulnerabilities, ensuring the integrity and security of our blockchain transactions.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, OpenEden implements strict access controls to enhance the security of both on-chain and off-chain treasury management. We employ the dual control principle, which requires multiple authorizations for critical actions, thereby minimising the risk of unauthorised access or fraudulent activities.

Is the project permissioned? If so, how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong><br>\nYes, only users who have fully cleared KYC and satisfied the Fund’s onboarding requirements will be whitelisted. Only whitelisted addresses can interact with the TBILL Vault dapp and hold $TBILL. Transfers are only permissible between whitelisted addresses. Additionally, the vault has a blacklisting feature, where addresses identified as blacklisted are prohibited from transferring or interacting with the OE TBILL Vault, including subscribing for or redeeming $TBILL tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross chain interactions?</strong><br>\nThe product is available on Ethereum and Arbitrum networks. There are currently no cross-chain interactions between $TBILL on the two networks, though there may be plans for such integrations in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong><br>\n$TBILL tokens have been accepted as eligible collateral on Hidden Road Partners through a tri-party agreement between OpenEden, Zodia Custody and Hidden Road Partners. Discussions are currently ongoing for $TBILL to be used as collateral on lending/borrowing DeFi protocols, perpetual exchanges and others.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong><br>\nAll actions which require admin intervention (such as asset transfers between venues, modification of the USDC deposit address, etc) are protected by multi-sig or multi-approval mechanisms to prevent any single admin user from executing any actions individually. The Fund Administrator is also part of the list of multi-sig approvers to provide external third-party oversight over such actions.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the OE TBILL Vault operates with a strict protocol where $TBILL tokens can only be minted in the presence of the underlying asset, USDC. This process is entirely managed on-chain, distinguishing it from other systems where manual token issuance might occur. The vault does not possess the authority to freely mint tokens; it can only mint $TBILL tokens when equivalent USDC deposits are confirmed, ensuring that token creation is always backed by actual assets. This key feature minimises trust reliance, making our system inherently more secure and transparent compared to traditional incumbents in the space.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong><br>\nNo, the $TBILL is a standard ERC-20 token.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"supplementary-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#supplementary-9\"></a>Supplementary</h1>\n<p><strong>1.

Basics and background</h1>\n<p><strong>1. How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>KNOX is an RToken deployed with Reserve protocol. To help answer this question, let’s familiarize ourselves with Reserve.</p>\n<p>Reserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet (as well as Arbitrum and Base) to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming onchain. Figure 3 illustrates an RToken’s potential.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/bf388f1bddb0d66418f80a22dd1d037e6a49e30d.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"rhCnbDtUCZdNE8Jrrwiv2KLApQ1\" width=\"624\" height=\"273\" role=\"presentation\"><br>\n<em>Figure 3: What are RTokens?</em></p>\n<p>RTokens enjoy numerous advantages over holding naked tokenized assets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Responsible governance by stakers with capital at risk</li>\n<li>Overcollateralization shielding in case of depeg events</li>\n<li>Diversified backing</li>\n<li>Permissionless, free onchain deployment, minting and redeeming</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, Electronic Dollar (eUSD) was the first RToken and is a safety-first stablecoin (backed by Aave and Compound deposits) that brings together diversified, highly liquid backing with<a href=\"https://twitter.com/griffpeer/status/1766927506597114354\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> anti-bank run overcollateralization that currently exceeds more than the value of the TVL of the RToken itself</a>. eUSD has been chosen as the stablecoin for two retail user applications: 1)<a href=\"https://ugly.cash/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Ugly Cash 1</a> - an app that gives bank-like services to customers throughout LatAm, enabling them to receive USD remittance from the US at 0% fee and spend their eUSD with a debit card. 2)<a href=\"https://www.sentz.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Sentz 1</a> - an app built on the MobileCoin blockchain that enables users to send and receive payments globally from anyone you can text for (basically) free.</p>\n<p>So, how will this improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecoststem? <em>By deepening RWA liquidity on the network</em>.</p>\n<p>KNOX becomes a demonstration vehicle for additional RWA use cases within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Its promise lies both in its composition today but also its future potential integrations.</p>\n<p>KNOX is backed entirely by USDC, an onchain representation of a dollar in a bank account - an RWA. By minting KNOX, the Arbitrum Foundation will be deepening its RWA ecosystem as KNOX collateral is Aave and Compound USDC deposits - thereby deeping market liquidity and decreasing capital costs. Lower capital costs on Arbitrum may bring users from other networks to take advantage of network-specific protocols to maximize profitability and <a href=\"https://defillama.com/borrow?borrow=USD_STABLES&amp;incentives=true\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">in such a competitive market landscape every bit helps</a>.</p>\n<p>A STEP allocation could also encourage users familiar with Reserve to bridge to Arbitrum to take advantage of KNOX APY and may bring second order benefits for Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem such as deeper Compound / Aave liquidity and new users for Arbitrum protocols. This RToken mint could improve both Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem and Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Identify key management personnel and individual experience. Also include third parties utilized for managing assets and their qualifications.</strong></p>\n<p>The Reserve protocol and RTokens such as KNOX are governed onchain through smart contracts, transparently, by capital-risking, incentive-aligned RSR stakers.

Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor or similar rights?</strong></p>\n<p>No shareholders, investors, creditors or any other parties have preferential rights over KNOX. RTokens are fully noncustodial and only the holder of the RToken can redeem it to access underlying collateral.</p>\n<p>Those staking $RSR on the KNOX RToken receive governance votes and yield from the collateral revenue in exchange for providing first loss capital.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>KNOX is an RToken deployed using Reserve that is fully decentralized and available through permissionless smart contracts onchain only. ABC Labs’ primary role in the Reserve ecosystem is the creation and maintenance of the Reserve protocol and it contributes from within the USA. ABC Labs but is one of many ecosystem contributors to the project and does not deploy RTokens itself. RTokens like KNOX do not have an issuer as the minting process is entirely manifested by users in smart contracts when they deposit the underlying collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Arbitrum’s KNOX assets inherit the properties of Compound, Aave and USDC. Neither the KNOX creator nor ABC Labs have any control over the KNOX asset-backing which are transparently locked in smart contracts onchain and controlled by governance.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation’s assets are held in non-custodial smart contracts. Should KNOX collateral depeg, $RSR overcollateralization will go some distance to recapitalize Arbitrum’s KNOX. This mechanism has already been market stress tested during the<a href=\"https://blog.reserve.org/eusd-emerges-strong-the-resilience-of-reserve-protocol-during-usdc-depegging-e5a698a990c9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> USDC depeg of March 2023</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no formal issuer on the Reserve protocol given its fully onchain decentralized nature. Although ABC Labs does not deploy RTokens, the protocol has been used by others to deploy 1000+ RTokens assets accounting for ~$90M in TVL to date. Each RToken has independent governance, independent asset backing and independent overcollateralization. There is no priority between different RTokens or collateral.</p>\n<p>The KNOX RToken does have emergency collateral with different “diversity factors”, which represents the priority placed on each emergency collateral. KNOX’s emergency collateral is <a href=\"https://feature-arbitrum-support.reserve-register.pages.dev/arbitrum/token/0x0bbf664d46becc28593368c97236faa0fb397595/settings\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DAi, USDC and USDT</a> with a diversity factor of 2, which means 2 of the backup tokens are used to replace any single defaulting collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>We do not give tax advice and it is dependent on the country where the holder lives; however our understanding is that when KNOX is redeemed for a greater monetary value than the amount minted, there is a tax differential. RToken holders are responsible for their own tax obligations and should consult with a tax advisor with up to date information about their relevant tax jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>KNOX can be permissionlessly redeemed by its holders onchain, 24/7.</p>\n<p>Given the size of this withdrawal, RToken throttles would apply, limiting mints to 7.5% (or $2,500,000, whichever is greater) of KNOX’s TVL per hour. This may result in Arbitrum’s redemption requiring a few hours to fully complete, but ABC Labs contributors would be available to guide the process.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>Overcollateralization is provided by RSR stakers and driven by a combination of revenue distributed to stakers and risk profile of the RToken’s underlying collateral. Overcollateralization rates are set by the market. However, using other RTokens as yardsticks, somewhere between 11% overcollateralization <a href=\"https://app.reserve.org/ethereum/token/0xacdf0dba4b9839b96221a8487e9ca660a48212be/overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">(High Yield USD)</a> to 83% overcollateralization <a href=\"https://app.reserve.org/ethereum/token/0xa0d69e286b938e21cbf7e51d71f6a4c8918f482f/overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">($eUSD)</a> may be possible.

Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>ABC Labs has developed Reserve protocol smart contracts with risk management front and centre. Risk management is an ongoing process and monitoring tools such as <a href=\"https://www.hypernative.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Hypernative alert the team</a> (located across all timezones) perpetually to important protocol activity. Aside from the 6 year development process, 8 (and counting) audits, $5M bug bounty previous stated, please see this addendum to ABC Labs risk management policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The protocol and collateral plugins are all heavily unit tested, with code coverage of 98% or above. They also have extensive integration tests, and exhaustive tests that test permutations of the most extreme configurations and states allowed by the protocol.</li>\n<li>Additionally, there are 3 separate echidna suites that fuzz the protocol. Every test must pass for a new release to make it to production</li>\n<li>No code is allowed to be used in production until it has been audited at least once with the majority of code in production being audited 3 or more times.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asset risk management for RToken collateral is conducted by RToken governors. Given that this is informal and decentralized, there is no codified risk management policy to attach. However, here is a brief insight into some of the considerations taken when discussing basket changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collateral asset: what is the underlying asset for the yield-bearing collateral? Does it have a <a href=\"http://bluechip.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bluechip.org</a> rating? What are its trust assumptions? How can it be redeemed? How deep is onchain liquidity? What are borrow rates on multiplier markets?</li>\n<li>Underlying protocols: how long have they held TVL? How many audits does the code have? Is there a bug bounty? How decentralized is parameter decision making? Is there a monolithic approach to risk management or is it more granular? Does it have an ITB Risk Radar rating? How have DeFiSafety scored it? How liquid is the collateral’s market? What is the RToken asset being supplied being borrowed collateralized with by borrowers?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://blog.reserve.org/comprehensive-risk-mitigation-at-reserve-protocol-68a724e9989e#a23f\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Comprehensive Risk Mitigation at Reserve protocol.</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"h-6-performance-reporting-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-6-performance-reporting-6\"></a>6. Performance reporting</h1>\n<p><strong>1. What are your proposed performance benchmarks? If this is substantially different from the underlying assets, please explain why.</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed performance benchmark is DAI Savings Rate. If KNOX provides sustained, higher comparable yield to its offering (currently 10%), then this treasury allocation is outperforming the benchmark DeFi rate and can be viewed as a success. KNOX is both diversified and enjoys an amount of overcollateralization, which presents advantages over a deposit into the DAI Savings Rate.</p>\n<p>Indeed, while KNOX’s current holder APY just meets that target, the revenue share structure (explained in supplementary) may more than compensate for that over the course of a year. It is also true that the market is in a minor downtrend at the moment, reducing Aave and Compound rates.</p>\n<p>Given that KNOX deposits collateral into lending markets, a utilization benchmark should also be pursued. One of the key value propositions of this treasury allocation by the Arbitrum Foundation is the second order benefits additional liquidity begets so these should be monitored.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the content, format, preparation process, and cadence of performance reports. This should include proof of reserves, if appropriate. Please include a sample report.</strong></p>\n<p>Performance reports would be placed in a thread on the Arbitrum forum and updated biweekly. They would include the following metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>KNOX APY for period</li>\n<li>Arbitrum Foundation Earnings for period (including both KNOX appreciation and 2.5% fee)</li>\n<li>KNOX collateral composition</li>\n<li>KNOX TVL</li>\n<li>KNOX overcollateralization ratios</li>\n<li>Aave and Compound USDC outstanding borrows</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lEPHYj8YG1oTgujN0IwRPxBlFJgFliFrQsC8Gs7xtxI/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">A sample comment can be viewed here. </a></p>\n<p><strong>3. Who provides the performance reports in respect of the underlying assets?</strong></p>\n<p>These performance reports would be produced by ABC Labs contributors. Nevertheless, since the data is available onchain, anyone could verify / replicate the results as required. The preparation process would be straightforward.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe any formal audit process and timing of such audits</strong>.</p>\n<p>There is no formal audit process since all data is available onchain publicly.

Nevertheless, these <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/usdp-oracle-manipulation-event-16th-april/17385\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">oracles are not flawless</a>.</li>\n<li><em>Governance risk</em>: it is not impossible that governance on each protocol may change parameters to allow unsafe loan-to-value ratios (for example) and accrue bad debt to the protocol. This is unlikely given the largely risk averse nature of contributors to both DAOs, as demonstrated by Aave delegates’ recent discussion on <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/aave-decides-to-reduce-makerdao-s-dai-collateral-after-proposal-to-completely-eliminate-it?ref=onepagecrypto.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DAI’s suitability as a collateral token. </a>\n<ul>\n<li>Indeed, should bad debt occur and Arbitrum’s deposits be irretrievable, both Aave (with its <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">safety module</a>) and Compound (with<a href=\"https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#total-reserves\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> its reserves</a>) offer additional capital to backstop this process. This exists before considerations about RToken overcollateralization come into play. This risk is measured.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, there is <em>custodian risk</em> from highly centralized Circle, with which USDC collateral is held. Circle is <a href=\"https://www.circle.com/en/transparency\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a highly transparent custodian</a>. Nevertheless, with DAOs holding ~$700M of the asset makes USDC the most popular way for DAOs to currently store value (outside of their own token / ETH).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Indeed, once more, as this DAO treasury mint is held in KNOX, it enjoys overcollateralization protection. <a href=\"https://blog.reserve.org/eusd-emerges-strong-the-resilience-of-reserve-protocol-during-usdc-depegging-e5a698a990c9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">This proved its worth during USDC’s depeg, with Electronic Dollar $eUSD being restored to peg the day after USDC depegged</a>, despite USDC holders not being made whole until days later.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is fair to say that the few trusted roles/admins managed in the system have had their potential impact minimized through the RToken system.

Indeed, an allocation now may turn into a self-sustaining form of revenue for the DAO. This directly aligns incentives between Reserve’s ecosystem and Arbitrum’s - which should mean a win for either is a win for both. A STEP allocation could kickstart this process.</p>\n<p><strong>2. KNOX’s age</strong></p>\n<p>As you can see, KNOX is a recent RToken. It was deployed less than a week before this application was submitted. As market participants know, there is no better endorsement than smart contracts holding funds for a long period of time.</p>\n<p>Given that Reserve contracts have been live now and crossed ~$90M in TVL across its deployments, it is not unreasonable to state that these assets have been proven. Even during the USDC depeg stress test, an <a href=\"https://blog.reserve.org/eusd-emerges-strong-the-resilience-of-reserve-protocol-during-usdc-depegging-e5a698a990c9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">internal RToken failsafe was triggered that further protected $eUSD holders.</a></p>\n<p>KNOX uses entirely the same code (with a small, audited modification to be compatible with Arbitrum’s faster blocktimes) as eUSD. The collateral is the same (there is a case to be made that it is safer with no USDT exposure), the KNOX RToken contract is (effectively) identical, the revenue handling is the same, the audits are on the same code, the testing has been done on the same code, the four risk types have been considered in the same way and the bug bounty is still the same $5M.</p>\n<p>ABC Labs contributors invested 6 years of rigorous system design and testing. KNOX inherits the provable resilience of the Reserve protocol’s other RTokens. KNOX is as safe as a mint into any other major RToken.</p>\n<p><strong>3. KNOX Governance</strong></p>\n<p>KNOX is a young asset but leverages tens of thousands of RSR holders and 18 months of live market governance experience with RSR stakers. The Reserve ecosystem may alternatively offer an interest-free loan to the Arbitrum Foundation if preferred so that the Foundation will have an influence on KNOX’s future. This staked RSR provides an additional revenue stream to the Arbitrum DAO in addition to governance influence.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"closing-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#closing-10\"></a>Closing</h1>\n<p>Thank you for your consideration and patience with these applications.

Centrifuge has since been developing the ecosystem and demand for RWAs on Arbitrum, starting with a webinar with Offchain Labs co-founder Steven Goldfeder in November sharing the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/events/7125924551783297024/comments/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vision for bringing RWAs to Arbitrum</a>. Centrifuge is fully operational on Arbitrum and ready to accept investments from day one. Centrifuge is multi-chain by design, meaning all of the liquidity and TVL will stay on Arbitrum.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"decentralization-is-our-dna-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#decentralization-is-our-dna-7\"></a>Decentralization Is Our DNA</h4>\n<p>Centrifuge itself is a fully decentralized DAO, and comes with an active ecosystem and contributors. A partnership in this capacity would further the network effects of our relationship by connecting both ecosystems. The Centrifuge ecosystem consists of issuers and liquidity providers, which the Arbitrum ecosystem can onboard at any time.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"tvl-on-the-most-trusted-rwa-protocol-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tvl-on-the-most-trusted-rwa-protocol-8\"></a>TVL On The Most Trusted RWA Protocol</h4>\n<p>An investment through Centrifuge’s platform will bolster RWAs on Arbitrum by bootstrapping network liquidity for one of the largest RWA protocols onchain. The Stable Treasury Endowment Program was set up not only to improve treasury health, but to strengthen projects built on Arbitrum. Using Centrifuge will grow RWA TVL on the Arbitrum network on the most well-recognized RWA protocol. Bootstrapping liquidity on Arbitrum would also further the case for building DeFi primitives composable with our permissioned tokens on the Arbitrum network itself.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"introducing-anemoy-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introducing-anemoy-9\"></a>Introducing Anemoy</h4>\n<p>Anemoy is a web3 native asset manager built on Centrifuge. The Anemoy DeFi Yield Fund (DYF) is a regulated, fully onchain fund of funds for direct access to DeFi yields through centralized asset managers. The fund is approved and regulated by the BVI Financial Services Commission (BVI FSC).</p>\n<p>Centrifuge proposes that the Stable Treasury and Endowment Program start allocating to DYF through Anemoy to further diversification of stable yields within the STEP program. DYF will give the foundation a passive way to benefit from high DeFi rate environments, without having to worry about the complexities of managing positions.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><a name=\"identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-10\"></a>Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

Some relevant partners to Arbitrum include MakerDAO, BlockTower, Aave, Frax, and GnosisDAO. Centrifuge is happy to facilitate introductions between organizations as requested. Brief descriptions of our work are below:</p>\n<p>MakerDAO:</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2022, we proposed alongside institutional lender, BlockTower, to launch a $220M securitization pool on Centrifuge. The underlying assets were made up of senior loan positions in invoice financing, trade finance, or other short-term receivables. Today, BlockTower pools on Centrifuge have around $190M in assets. The BlockTower arrangement was the first time a credit fund’s operations had been brought onchain, requiring immense legal and operational work to bring to fruition. Much of our DAO protocol work since has taken learnings and structures from this arrangement to implement elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Centrifuge began working closely with MakerDAO in 2020 when our first real estate credit pool was <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ns-drop-mip6-application-new-silver-drop-real-estate-backed-loans/3477\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposed</a> with New Silver. Since then, New Silver has launched another pool with MakerDAO titled New Silver II, where they got a debt ceiling increase from $20M to $50M.</p>\n<p>Aave:<br>\nThe Centrifuge RWA Market on Aave was launched in 2021 marking the first institutional-grade RWA lending market. This allowed users to deposit stablecoins in return for senior or junior tranches of credit directly within the Aave application. The Aave DAO recently has approved to onboard the Aave Treasury into Centrifuge Prime, to allocate an investment into the Anemoy US Treasury Bill fund.</p>\n<p>Celo:</p>\n<p>Celo is another network using Anemoy on the Centrifuge platform to better their long-term sustainability for their treasury. They’ve invested in Anemoy’s LTF and have intentions to diversify into other assets including Flow Carbon’s offset pool. Centrifuge is live on Celo through Liquidity Pools, marking the first use case of our multi-chain product. TVL remains on the Celo network, akin to this proposal with Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>GnosisDAO:<br>\nSome of our newest clients include GnosisDAO, who decided to allocate a portion of their treasury to Centrifuge Prime, mainly the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund. The <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0xa779ccda18ee2aeb56894e8b5baafd3d2568e99b0fea4a03dd246f548084a93c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GnosisDAO proposal</a> includes $10M being allocated. Karpatkey is the financial service provider for GnosisDAO who is now managing the day to day operations of all investments including in RWAs.</p>\n<p>Frax:<br>\nFrax is another DAO that recently decided to onboard the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund. The Frax treasury will be bringing $20M to RWAs as outlined in this <a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-308-onboard-frax-to-centrifuge-prime/2775\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">recent proposal</a>. This is a strong step in the direction of working towards long term sustainability of the DAO in light of ongoing liabilities and ecosystem development.</p>\n<p>Web3 Foundation:</p>\n<p>The Web3 Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that supports Web3 teams and open-source projects through funding, advocacy, research and collaboration, recently <a href=\"https://centrifuge.mirror.xyz/RPd-sjMJLK9W2UYknAM09EJwguxHJci-dbc2msd27MU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">announced their investment</a> with Anemoy on the Centrifuge platform.

It was created for DeFi and TradFi investors to capture yields within DeFi from high quality institutional funds on public blockchains. The fund is attractive in all market environments. It is a fund of funds with a focus on private, market-neutral funds starting with Re7 Capital and Dialectic, and soon onboarding several more.</p>\n<p>The fund of funds structure for DeFi yields is unique in that it provides onchain investors ulta-safe access to DeFi rates in an actively managed manner, and offchain investors built in diversification with low fees. The fund of funds structure further abstracts away single protocol counterparty risks that all of the underlying funds already control for. The fund will start with an already committed investment of +$1M so that balancing portfolios is more seamless initially as the fund is being setup due to the minimum investments in the underlying funds . The underlying assets consist of market-neutral cash and carry trades, lending stablecoins in blue chip protocols (Aave etc), or LP’ing in stable AMM pairs.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/84a9580a9fc502ced4cb82d94dbbf19b96c23fd2.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/iVzQjp4ULZJwZuvswKzq67GdSlc.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/84a9580a9fc502ced4cb82d94dbbf19b96c23fd2_2_690x364.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"iVzQjp4ULZJwZuvswKzq67GdSlc\" width=\"690\" height=\"364\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/84a9580a9fc502ced4cb82d94dbbf19b96c23fd2_2_690x364.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/84a9580a9fc502ced4cb82d94dbbf19b96c23fd2_2_1035x546.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/84a9580a9fc502ced4cb82d94dbbf19b96c23fd2_2_1380x728.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EFEDE9\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Anemoy DYF tokens fully represent the BVI fund shares. They come with full legal shareholder recourse rights to the underlying assets under BVI law (shares are issued as tokens following BVI law). The token price directly reflects the NAV of the fund with fees already withheld from the price. As mentioned above, the NAV is updated monthly. Investors invest and redeem monthly based on the updated NAV. The token is not a rebasing token.</p>\n<p>Benefits of the Anemoy structure include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‍Liquidity: The fund offers monthly redemption orders with 30-day notice. Quarterly redemptions and 60-day notice is common among private hedge funds.</li>\n<li>Direct Ownership: The tokens serve as direct evidence of ownership of the fund shares, allowing cost-efficient redemptions and providing full legal claims on assets.</li>\n<li>Investor Protection: Prospective investors must adhere to the Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering requirements of a BVI-regulated professional fund, ensuring a secure and transparent investment environment well-protected from regulatory risk and sanctions enforcement.</li>\n<li>Transparency: Centrifuge provides near real-time onchain visibility of holdings, returns, and tokenized private shares.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why The Anemoy DeFi Yield Fund? Combine DeFi Yield With T-Bill Liquidity</p>\n<p>The financial goal for the STEP program is to deploy Arbitrum Treasury Funds in stable, liquid, yield bearing assets. DYF represents yield that is not tied to U.S interest rates, as we expect most other STEP allocation to be. This allows for the Arbitrum Foundation to access uncorrelated yield furthering diversification, and benefit from safe yield opportunities in DeFi through externalized professional risk managers with a long track record in the space.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/cb90a1201a37fccb9209e4decf350f98a5746e43.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/t2ONcpWGhVBDTZNKpRM4pLgPQjh.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cb90a1201a37fccb9209e4decf350f98a5746e43_2_547x205.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"t2ONcpWGhVBDTZNKpRM4pLgPQjh\" width=\"547\" height=\"205\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cb90a1201a37fccb9209e4decf350f98a5746e43_2_547x205.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cb90a1201a37fccb9209e4decf350f98a5746e43_2_820x307.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cb90a1201a37fccb9209e4decf350f98a5746e43_2_1094x410.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E9E9E4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Stability:</p>\n<p>In the 48 months (4-yrs) of data we have on the two funds, only three months out of the 48 had negative returns.

The underlying funds are restricted to monthly redemption liquidity on the first of the month when requested at 30-days’ notice. We believe when mixed with lower-yielding, more liquid products, and inversely correlated assets, DYF is a very strong choice for a higher-yielding fund. It is important to note that monthly redemptions are relatively liquid for private professional funds.

It’s important to note that in 2020 and 2021, “DeFi summer” occurred leading to exceedingly high returns not feasible in DeFi markets as we know them today. This leads to the total historical volatility of DYF being misleading at 64%. The volatility of monthly returns annualized in 2023 for example was 3.2% post DeFi summer, more reflective of what DeFi rates look like today.</p>\n<p>Over its history, the sharpe ratio of DYF, the excess returns divided by annual volatility, significantly outperformed other relevant benchmarks. The sharpe ratio is the golden formula in traditional finance for simply calculating risk-adjusted returns. The Sortino ratio does the same, except only looks at the volatility of returns less than 0%, as to not penalize volatility in the upward direction.</p>\n<p>The correlations show that DYF is non or negatively correlated with other major asset classes, notably being negatively correlated with AAA corporate bonds, representative of the belief that DYF is a valuable asset in combination with T-Bill funds.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6c6f3b52540a4e6e29f52e714eb694cf674d75d9.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ftfSxupUwklTCA7etfJwl6606N3.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6c6f3b52540a4e6e29f52e714eb694cf674d75d9_2_609x236.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ftfSxupUwklTCA7etfJwl6606N3\" width=\"609\" height=\"236\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6c6f3b52540a4e6e29f52e714eb694cf674d75d9_2_609x236.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6c6f3b52540a4e6e29f52e714eb694cf674d75d9_2_913x354.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6c6f3b52540a4e6e29f52e714eb694cf674d75d9_2_1218x472.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F3EE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The above chart visualizes the sharpe ratio of DYF against both the S&amp;P and Eth in 2023, which it significantly outperformed.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/93726f44ce10264a119706af6a30a66782726602.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/l2nmwkt0uYM22hr8XUdyw9Bs5HQ.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93726f44ce10264a119706af6a30a66782726602_2_604x232.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"l2nmwkt0uYM22hr8XUdyw9Bs5HQ\" width=\"604\" height=\"232\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93726f44ce10264a119706af6a30a66782726602_2_604x232.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93726f44ce10264a119706af6a30a66782726602_2_906x348.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93726f44ce10264a119706af6a30a66782726602_2_1208x464.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F2ED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/2b9c37d3cbdb951b8c8ca01c847252bb58f3edf2.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6dNe4fB2xfR4Z7OC0YX7EJ0MBNw.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2b9c37d3cbdb951b8c8ca01c847252bb58f3edf2_2_630x252.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"6dNe4fB2xfR4Z7OC0YX7EJ0MBNw\" width=\"630\" height=\"252\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2b9c37d3cbdb951b8c8ca01c847252bb58f3edf2_2_630x252.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2b9c37d3cbdb951b8c8ca01c847252bb58f3edf2_2_945x378.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2b9c37d3cbdb951b8c8ca01c847252bb58f3edf2_2_1260x504.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F2EE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The above charts show DYF having exceedingly high annual alphas against both Eth and the S&amp;P for both 1/22 to present, and 1/23 to present. Notably also, the beta shows DYF had near zero (or negative) systematic market risk tied to either Eth or the S&amp;P for both timeframes.</p>\n<p>A beta coefficient measures the volatility of an individual asset compared to the systematic risk of the entire market (in this case the S&amp;P and Eth). Statistically, it’s the covariance of the individual asset returns and those of the market, divided by the variance of returns of the market. According to efficient market philosophy, investors are only compensated for systematic risk in a market, and any deviation from this is called ‘alpha’, which can be positive (good), or negative (bad).</p>\n<p>DYF as shown as the y-intercept above, shows extremely high alpha over both timeframes. DYF historically has taken very little/no market risk, yet generated strong returns. This is mainly attributed to DeFi operating in somewhat of a silo, separated from traditional asset managers arbing the alpha away.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"about-the-first-two-funds-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#about-the-first-two-funds-24\"></a>About The First Two Funds</h4>\n<p>Dialectic:</p>\n<p>Dialectic is a premier, tech forward Zug based crypto asset manager founded in 2020.

Operational risk is minimized due to a highly simplified and streamlined process. Legal and regulatory risk is minimal as the fund is fully licensed under BVI law. The BVI Financial Services Commission is one of the world’s only regulators actively allowing and regulating funds such as the one being proposed. This allows Anemoy to not provide services in the gray areas of the law.</p>\n<p>Trident Trust - the fund administrator - oversees meticulous KYC/KYB/AML protocols. Anemoy ensures stringent BVI compliance standards are met, safeguarding against illicit activities. Monthly NAV checks are completed and overseen by seasoned Professional Fund Administrators and reviewed by Trident Trust to maintain stability and integrity for the pool. Access to pivotal financial hubs like Circle, and bank accounts are prudently restricted, bolstering asset protection measures.</p>\n<p>The Anemoy DeFi Yield Fund does intense research supported by independent subject matter experts to select funds with a minimum of 2-year successful operating history, a strong track record, and a proven market-neutral strategy. Further criteria are at least monthly NAV and redemptions with no more than 30-days for notifications. As a fund of funds, The Anemoy DeFi Yield Fund offers participation in the best market-neutral strategies.</p>\n<p>Anemoy will start with two funds - those of Re7 Capital and Dialectic - and will further diversify to up to ten funds as the fund grows. The limitations of the underlying funds mean such a diversified portfolio can’t occur right from the start. For example, minimum investment sizes/redemptions make it impossible to support ten funds from day one.

Additionally, by the time the last STIP report was released, we had successfully locked over $17 million worth of assets on Arbitrum through our initiatives, including PENDLE, GRAIL, RDNT, and WOM, aiding the sustained development of Arbitrum’s core platforms.</p>\n<p>Also, we learned the importance of incentivizing liquidity pairs for liquid wrappers to deepen liquidity and provide a reliable avenue for users to sell their positions while supporting the peg of the liquid wrapper tokens. This encourages user participation and supports the long-term development of top Arbitrum protocols by effectively decreasing the circulating supply of governance tokens.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-3\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7.

[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>We plan to continue leveraging incentives in alignment with our goals to boost user engagement and support the core functionalities of protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In addition to sustaining our commitments to lock up governance tokens from Pendle Finance, Radiant Capital, and Camelot DEX, we are adjusting our incentive strategies to include liquidity providers. Notably, MGP liquidity providers from Magpie will receive 100% of the ARB tokens allocated to Magpie through the STIP Addendum, while liquidity providers on Penpie, Radpie, and Campie will be able to share 40% of the incentives allocated to them respectively. This change reflects our decision to ensure more balanced and sustained liquidity across our supported platforms.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we are excited to introduce a new initiative with Eigenpie, a liquid restaking platform created by Magpie. The allocation of ARB to Eigenpie will focus on growing the TVL of LRTs on Arbitrum, reflecting a strategic expansion to leverage new products and deepen network functionalities. This adaptation showcases that we not only maintain but also enhance our support for the Arbitrum network and its participants. We consider LRTs to be an important category in DeFi, and we aim to help position Arbitrum as a hub for LRTs with Egienpie.</p>\n<p>STIP Addendum Allocations for the Magpie Ecosystem</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Penpie - 285,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>60% RUSH events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>40% LPs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Radpie - 100,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>60% RUSH events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>40% LPs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Campie - 100,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>60% RUSH events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>40% LPs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Magpie - 40,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>100% Incentivize MGP liquidity on Arbitrum</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Eigenpie - 100,000 ARB</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>100% Incentivize LRT LPs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10.

Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<p>The Magpie Ecosystem saw a significant increase in TVL, growing by more than 140% since the initiation of STIP fund distribution on Arbitrum. Our primary objective was to absorb the governance tokens of protocols we collaborate with, thereby enhancing yield and governance influence across various platforms, which led to increased advantages for users within the Magpie Ecosystem. This strategy moves beyond merely boosting TVL, which can attract temporary capital that targets STIP-related funds and departs once ARB incentives are no longer available. Our approach drives sustainable, long-term benefit for users, enabling them to gain more from the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem even beyond the STIP period. Despite receiving a smaller STIP grant compared to other platforms, the Magpie ecosystem has successfully increased participation, TVL, and activity within Arbitrum. We advocate for Arbitrum to consider this approach in the future as a proven strategy, as it not only contributes to TVL growth in the short-term but also supports the enduring value of the tokens from protoocls within the network.</p>\n<p>Through this initiative we effectively supported the long-term value of governance tokens from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pendle (2nd biggest protocol by TVL on Arbitrum at the moment)</li>\n<li>Camelot (7th biggest protocol by TVL on Arbitrum at the moment)</li>\n<li>Radiant (13th biggest protocol by TVL on Arbitrum at the moment)</li>\n<li>Wombat Exchange (Hyper-efficient stableswap)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Marketing Support: Arbitrum could utilize its prominent market presence to boost user awareness about the advantages offered through STIP/Grants programs. By actively promoting these programs, Arbitrum could greatly increase user engagement and enhance visibility of their benefits, which may result in more funds flowing into the network.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts -

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The addition of Backed Finance’s tokenized fixed income products to Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem will provide a low-risk, stable source of yield generation. Assets like the bIB01, bZPR1, bERNX, and bERNA offer consistent, predictable returns through their underlying exposure to government bonds and investment-grade corporate debt. This reliable yield can be reinvested into other parts of the Arbitrum ecosystem, supporting the growth and development of new protocols, applications, and services. By incorporating these tokenized fixed income products, Arbitrum can establish a sustainable source of funding for its broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>bTokens are issued by Backed Assets (JE) Limited, incorporated in Jersey. Tokens are issued under license by the JFSC, the Jersey Financial and Securities regulator. The issuer is also AML licensed and regulated in Jersey.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Jersey regulation, bTokens are MIFID financial products by virtue of having an approved EU prospectus, filed with the Liechtenstein FMA.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>All Backed products are bankruptcy remote. bTokens are issued by an SPV, which is legally separated from Backed Finance AG, the tokenizer and the operator of the majority of employment activity.</p>\n<p>A 1:1 ratio of underlying is maintained at all times. It is supervised by both a “proof-of-reserve”, which is published the collateralization status on-chain, and by an appointed security agent, which has the authority to seize the assets on behalf of token holders in case there is any deviation from the commitments the issuer has made.</p>\n<p><strong>5. <strong>How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable</strong> financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>The underlying assets which guarantee the bTokens are book entry securities held in custody by a licensed Swiss bank, and are therefore “off-balance-sheet”, namely they are not exposed to the financial situation of the custodian bank.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>Backed issues a variety of products. Each product has a dedicated collateralized sub account with the custodian bank, which holds the assets of that specific product. There is no seniority difference between the different products, each product has primary claim to its collateral assets.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<h4><a name=\"liquidity-of-all-the-different-assets-we-are-proposing-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquidity-of-all-the-different-assets-we-are-proposing-6\"></a><strong>Liquidity of all the different assets we are proposing:</strong></h4>\n<p>The underlying assets for Backed Finance’s tokenized fixed income products are highly liquid and stable, benefiting from the immense liquidity and trading volumes in their respective markets.</p>\n<p>For instance, the iShares € Ultrashort Bond UCITS ETF (ERNX) and iShares $ Ultrashort Bond UCITS ETF (ERNA) track indices composed of investment-grade corporate bonds denominated in euros and US dollars, respectively. While the net assets of these ETFs are in the billions (€3.1B and $1.3B), the liquidity of the underlying corporate bond markets is substantially larger.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the SPDR® Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill UCITS ETF (ZPR1) and iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF (IB01), with $453M and $14.9B in net assets, are underpinned by the highly liquid and stable US Treasury market, which has a total market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion.</p>\n<p>Even the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (CSPX), a $82B equity ETF, benefits from the immense liquidity of the large-cap US stock market, with the S&amp;P 500 components regularly trading billions of shares daily.</p>\n<p>The large size and trading volumes of these underlying fixed income and equity markets ensure ample liquidity for the respective tokenized versions offered by Backed. This liquidity, combined with the stability of high-quality assets like government bonds and investment-grade corporates, provides a solid foundation for Backed Finance’s tokenized products, ensuring efficient pricing and reliable redemption processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Settlement times:</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of settlement times, Backed settlement times ranges from T+1 to T+3 (Business days) , we aim to settle fiat/stablecoin with clients on T+1 (current stats show that we settle T+1 80% of the time)</p>\n<p>This rapid settlement, with the majority occurring within 1 business day, allows Backed to deliver the fiat or stablecoin proceeds to investors in the bTokens in a timely manner. The short settlement window minimizes the exposure to market movements between the sale of the underlying assets and the repayment to investors.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>No reliance on blockchain for the flows except token contracts, that are as close to standard as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>13. Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps,OTC agreements?)</strong></p>\n<p>No, all products are based on the original underlying security.</p>\n<p>Products are issued as debt certificates under EU law.

Can you explain how risk management (inv and operational) is being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Operational Risk Management:</strong></p>\n<p>Backed manages operational risks by maintaining  strict risk management policies that include detailed processes and continuous employee training.We limit access to sensitive operations, client’s information, and financial accounts to authorized personnel only… This said access is monitored and controlled through secure systems that require multiple approvals before any critical operation can be executed, ensuring additional safety and accountability.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of on-chain operations, Backed has partnered with a leading MPC provider and implemented multiple policy layers to ensure that at each step, only authorized personnel are able to make state changes and only after multiple signers given their approval for the action.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance and Reporting:</strong></p>\n<p>Backed ensures consistent compliance and operational integrity by conducting regular audits and reconciliations with our custodians and other third-party service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Security/Smart Contracts:</strong></p>\n<p>Backed places a strong emphasis on the security of our tokenization platform and smart contract integrity. To ensure the highest standards of safety, all of our smart contracts undergo rigorous audits conducted by reputable third-party security firms. These audits are designed to identify and rectify any vulnerabilities before the contracts are deployed, providing an extra layer of security. Additionally, we utilize a multi-signature approval process for all critical operations, which requires several trusted members of our team to approve any significant changes or transactions. This method greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and enhances the overall security of our operations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"performance-reporting-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#performance-reporting-7\"></a>Performance reporting</h2>\n<p><strong>1. What are your proposed performance benchmarks? If this is substantially different from the underlying assets, please explain why.</strong></p>\n<p>The performance benchmarks for Backed’s tokenized products will be directly aligned with the benchmarks used by the respective underlying ETFs or funds. As the tokenized versions are designed to track the performance of the physical products on a 1:1 basis, using the same benchmarks ensures consistency and transparency.</p>\n<p>For example, a tokenized ETF tracking a broad equity index like the S&amp;P 500 would use the S&amp;P 500 Index as its benchmark. Similarly, a tokenized fixed-income fund would benchmark against the appropriate bond index or yield curve.</p>\n<p>There is no need for substantially different benchmarks, as the goal is to provide investors with exposure to the same underlying assets and performance as the physical ETFs or funds. Using the industry-standard benchmarks allows for easy comparisons and evaluation of how well the tokenized products are tracking their respective underlying investments.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the content, format, preparation process, and cadence of performance reports. This should include proof of reserves, if appropriate. Please include a sample report.</strong></p>\n<p>The performance reports for Backed’s tokenized products will closely mirror the reporting provided by the respective issuers of the underlying ETFs or funds. Investors can refer to the regular performance reports published by the asset managers, which typically include details on net asset value, total returns, portfolio composition, and other key metrics.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Backed utilizes Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve solution to provide transparent and trust-minimized confirmation of the full collateralization of the tokens by the underlying assets.</p>\n<p>Proof of reserves <a href=\"https://por.backed.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a></p>\n<p><strong>3. Who provides the performance reports in respect of the underlying assets?</strong></p>\n<p>The performance reports for the underlying ETFs or funds are provided by the respective asset managers who issue and administer these products. For example, iShares (BlackRock) provides performance reports for their ETFs, while Amundi and other asset managers are responsible for reporting on their respective funds.</p>\n<p>As the issuers and administrators of the physical investment products, these asset managers are responsible for compiling and publishing regular performance reports, including details on net asset value, returns, portfolio holdings, and other key metrics.</p>\n<p>Backed will leverage these established performance reporting frameworks from the underlying product issuers to ensure transparency and alignment between the tokenized versions and their respective physical counterparts.</p>\n<p>A sample performance report for the IB01 ETF can be found on the iShares <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/uk/professional/en/products/307243/ishares-treasury-bond-0-1yr-ucits-etf?switchLocale=y&amp;siteEntryPassthrough=true\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">website</a> .</p>\n<p><strong>4.

As described in greater detail in other sections of this application below, the fund covered by this application, SGD Delta Fund, is the first sub-fund of the Delta Master Trust, a master fund structure designed for launching funds tokenized using the Libeara platform. The SGD Delta Fund has not yet been launched and as such its AUM is $0.</p>\n<p>Volume of transactions LTM: N/A, new fund</p>\n<p>Source of first-loss capital: N/A</p>\n<p><strong>Basics and Background</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>FundBridge Capital’s SGD Delta Fund (“SGDLTA” or the “Sub-Fund”), a sub-fund of the Delta Master Trust, is a fund whereby its units will be tokenized and issued via the Libeara platform. SGDLTA is the first investment grade-rated token in the Ethereum ecosystem, rated Aa-bf by Moody’s. As such, the tokens represent the introduction of a new primitive in the Arbitrum ecosystem: investment grade-rated assets.</p>\n<p>While there are a number of other tokenized fund units in the market, we believe ours is among the most secure due to the legal approach to structuring and the jurisdiction of issuance (Singapore). The fund units are tokenized and issued via the Libeara tokenization platform. Libeara is a new venture incubated and funded by Standard Chartered Bank, its parent. The SGDLTA fund is the first tokenized fund to be launched in collaboration with Libeara, whose roadmap also includes the tokenization of other fund units managed by leading fund managers and bonds issued by governments and corporates.</p>\n<p>We believe the Arbitrum community would benefit greatly from the introduction of an investment-grade primitive as well as the institutional presence of Libeara and its partners in the ecosystem. Furthermore, as an SGD-denominated investment linked to a portfolio of securities issued by the Government of Singapore, rated AAA by all three major credit rating agencies, SGDLTA offers currency and geopolitical risk diversification for the Arbitrum Treasury as it pursues its investment strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

For further details, please refer to the supplementary documents provided with this application.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>SGDLTA is the first sub-fund of the Delta Master Trust, an open-ended, umbrella unit trust designed for launching funds where the fund units are tokenized and issued using the Libeara tokenization platform. A separate portfolio will be maintained for each sub-fund established under the Delta Master Trust, and each sub-fund will have its own investment objectives and risks.</p>\n<p>SGDLTA has been designed and structured in compliance with the existing financial regulations in Singapore, a leading legal and regulatory jurisdiction. The umbrella unit trust structure was specifically selected as the fund vehicle of choice for SGDLTA due to its many years of use by the industry for open-ended funds (including in the retail investor space) at scale off-chain.</p>\n<p>Each of the Manager, the Trustee and the Custodian are regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the “MAS”) as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Manager is regulated by the MAS as a holder of a Capital Markets Services Licence to conduct the regulated activity of fund management in Singapore.</li>\n<li>the Trustee is regulated by the MAS as a trust company licensed under the Trust Companies Act 2005 of Singapore and an approved trustee under Section 289 of the SFA.</li>\n<li>the Custodian is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a holder of a Capital Markets Services licence for, among others, dealing in securities and providing custodial services for securities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please also note that the Fiat On/Off-Ramp Provider, Xfers Pte.

Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Pursuant to the trust deed constituting the Delta Master Trust, each sub-fund of the Delta Master Trust constitutes a trust separate and distinct from other sub-funds of Delta Master Trust and the assets of each sub-fund are held on trust by the Trustee for the unitholders of the relevant sub-fund. Consequently, the assets of SGDLTA will be held on trust by the Trustee and will not be affected by the liquidation of the Trustee, the Manager, Libeara or the liabilities of other sub-funds of Delta Master Trust. In the event of the liquidation of the Trustee, the assets of SGDLTA will not form part of the Trustee’s own property and will not be included in the pool of assets to be distributed to the Trustee’s creditors.</p>\n<p>As indicated in our response to the immediately preceding question, SGDLTA has been designed and structured in compliance with the existing financial regulations in Singapore, a leading legal and regulatory jurisdiction. The umbrella unit trust structure was specifically selected as the fund vehicle of choice for SGDLTA due to its many years of use by the industry for open-ended funds (including in the retail investor space) at scale off-chain.</p>\n<p>Full details of SGDLTA are available in the supplementary documents provided with this application.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>Under the terms of the prime services agreement with the Custodian, the assets of SGDLTA are to be segregated from the Custodian’s own assets and reflected as being owned by the Trustee (in its capacity as trustee of SGDLTA). As such, the liquidation of the Custodian should not affect the assets of SGDLTA, which should be assessed by the liquidators to be held on trust for the Trustee (in its capacity as trustee of SGDLTA) and not be included in the pool of assets to be distributed to the Custodian’s creditors. The Custodian, as a regulated entity, is also required by applicable laws to adhere to regulations applicable to the handling of customer moneys and assets.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>Each sub-fund of the Delta Master Trust is constituted by a separate and distinct trust.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>FundBridge maintains a Risk Management Policy Manual and Risk Management Registers on a firm wide basis as well as risk registers for each fund that it manages. This risk management framework covers the risks criteria/tools, frequency of monitoring as well as mitigating controls for inherent risks such as financial, investments, operations as well as legal/regulatory risks. The risk management process and internal controls are audited on a periodic basis with the audit frequency depending on the level of risk. FundBridge’s Board of Directors hold quarterly meetings and risk management, controls and compliance issues are reported to the Board.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance Reporting</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. What are your proposed performance benchmarks? If this is substantially different from the underlying assets, please explain why.</strong></p>\n<p>Our benchmark is the 3-month SGD Interbank Offer Rate, which is a typical benchmark for Singapore Dollar Short-Duration Government Bond Funds.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the content, format, preparation process, and cadence of performance reports. This should include proof of reserves, if appropriate. Please include a sample report.</strong></p>\n<p>Investors will be receiving monthly NAV statements as well as daily NAV prices prepared by the Fund Administrator, Vistra.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Who provides the performance reports in respect of the underlying assets?</strong></p>\n<p>FundBridge will be providing factsheets on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe any formal audit process and timing of such audits.</strong></p>\n<p>Financial audits are performed on an annual basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Provide a copy of your standard contract, or one similar to what is being proposed here.</strong></p>\n<p>Please see Subscription Agreement provided as supplementary documentation submitted privately with this application.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Fee summary</strong></p>\n<p>A summary of the applicable fees is set out below.</p>\n<p><strong>Fees and charges payable by Holders</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Sales Charge (payable to the Fund Manager): Currently none</li>\n<li>Redemption Charge: Currently none</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fee and charges payable by the Sub-Fund*</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Management Fee (per annum):</strong> Currently 0.3% of the Value of the Deposited Property of the Sub-Fund; maximum 0.5% of the Value of the Deposited Property of the Sub-Fund</li>\n<li><strong>Trustee’s Fee (per annum):</strong> Maximum 0.02% of the Value of the Deposited Property of the Sub-Fund. Subject to a minimum fee as may be agreed between the Manager and the Trustee</li>\n<li><strong>Fee payable to Libeara in connection with the provision of Delta Platforms (per annum):</strong> Currently 0% of the Value of the Deposited Property of the Sub-Fund; maximum 0.2% of the Value of the Deposited Property of the Sub-Fund</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Please refer to the Trust Deed for full details of the fees and charges that may be deducted out of the Deposited Property of the Sub-Fund.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Sub-Fund shall bear all costs and expenses in relation to the establishment and continued operation of the Sub-Fund out of its assets, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>all expenses properly incurred for the establishment of the Sub-Fund;</li>\n<li>all expenses properly incurred in connection with the offering of the Sub-Fund; and</li>\n<li>all operating expenses of the Sub-Fund, including any transactional expenses incurred in connection with investments and dispositions, and fees of professional (including legal and audit) advisers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please refer to the Trust Deed for further details on the expenses to be borne by the Sub-Fund.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe frequency of fee payment and its position vis-a-vis payment priority compared with other expenses (i.e., cash waterfall)</strong></p>\n<p>Fees and expenses are accrued and deducted on a daily basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract/Architecture</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. How many audits have you had and name of auditors? Please provide a copy of reports.</strong></p>\n<p>The Libeara platform has had one audit, performed by NCC Group in November 2023. Report provided privately in the supplemental documents submitted with this application. All findings in the report have been addressed.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Is the project permissioned? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Investors must complete KYC/AML and onboarding with the Fund Manager. Once onboarded, investors’ Ethereum wallet addresses are whitelisted in the Delta contracts, giving onboarded users full access to investment, transfer and redemption functionalities.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross-chain interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>SGDLTA is currently only available on Ethereum Mainnet. The Delta platform is also currently deployed on Arbitrum testnet, and we are actively working toward the launch of SGDLTA on Arbitrum One in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Support for cross-chain interactions is not part of the near-term roadmap.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>SGDLTA is not yet used in any protocols, though we expect it to be later this year. We view SGDLTA and the subsequent tokenized funds we issue as bridges between TradFi capital and DeFi functionality, especially given our relationship with Libeara, the tokenization platform provider, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>SGDLTA is designed and structured in compliance with existing financial regulations in Singapore, a leading legal and regulatory jurisdiction. The umbrella unit trust structure was specifically selected as the fund vehicle of choice for SGDLTA due to its many years of use by the industry for open-ended funds (including in the retail investor space) at scale off-chain.</p>\n<p>The Manager, Trustee, Securities Custodian and fund’s Bank are regulated firms in Singapore with fiduciary duties to SGDLTA investors. Furthermore, processes have been put in place to reconstitute token ownership and materialize tokenized fund units in the event of technical or operational necessity.</p>\n<p>Investors trust the Fund Manager and its delegated representative, the Fund Administrator, to mint tokens and process redemptions. Investors trust the fund’s Bank and Securities Custodian to secure the fund’s cash and securities.</p>\n<p>All Manager and Fund Administrator platform access is secured by 2FA. All platform access and actions are logged and subject to audit. All on-chain activities, including minting, burning and whitelisting, require Manager approval using Fireblocks MPC.</p>\n<p>Internal and external audits and reviews are performed regularly to ensure compliance with operational processes and regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<p>The SGDLTA token contract is built on top of the ERC-20 standard OpenZeppelin contract. The contract employs an on-chain whitelisting mechanism to restrict minting and transfers to wallet addresses owned by duly KYCed and onboarded investors in the fund. The contract also maintains a “clawback” function to recover tokens from lost or compromised wallets, requiring Fund Manager approval using Fireblocks MPC.</p>\n<p><strong>Supplementary</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong><br>\nThere are two main stated aims of the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Short and medium term, to diversify Treasury held ARB into assets that are stable in value, liquid, and will provide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called “risk free rate of return” of US Treasuries (hereby called ‘stable RWAs’); and</li>\n<li>To function as a trial run, both in terms of the smooth functioning of the legal and infrastructural piping as well as to provide a proof of concept that Arbitrum Treasury diversification can simultaneously support ecosystem growth.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Gyroscope’s GYD stablecoin is uniquely positioned to enable the Treasury WG to achieve both of these objectives.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>GYD is stable in value. See <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gyroscope-gyd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. The stablecoin was designed from the bottom up to be as resilient as possible as a store of value. This means:\n<ol>\n<li>A widely diversified all-weather reserve (as described above) with smart contract encoded safety checks to keep the vaults comprising the reserve within defined bounds;</li>\n<li>Smart contract encoded minting/redemption pricing which seeks to promote long-term stability, autonomously balancing the goal of maintaining a tight peg with the goal of long-term GYD stability in the face of short-term crises;</li>\n<li>A new on-chain oracle system, the Consolidated Price Feed, which minimizes trust on single oracle systems such as Chainlink and improves fault tolerance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>GYD is liquid. GYD is perhaps the most liquid stablecoin for its size, able to do more volume per day than its total circulating supply while remaining on peg. GYD also leverages Gyroscope E-CLP pools that are the most capital efficient in DeFi. Further, GYD is directly redeemable through a primary market.</li>\n<li>RWAs are a core part of GYD as currently calibrated, providing yield uncorrelated to crypto markets. RWAs are to comprise around 50% of the GYD Reserve. The expected yield on the GYD reserve is 9-10%, significantly more than the risk free rate on US Treasury bonds while featuring a very great degree of risk diversification. It should be noted that as of the time of writing, the GYD Reserve is mostly contained in an sDAI/GYD bootstrapping pool. This bootstrapping pool is implemented at the protocol level and has provided an initial simplified way to acquire GYD by providing a pre-set amount of GYD that can be ‘minted’ against sDAI as a reserve asset by swapping through the pool. Ahead of receiving an allocating from the Arbitrum Treasury, these sDAI reserves from the bootstrapping pool would be partially unwound into the proposed wider Gyroscope reserve as outlined above, across the 4 vaults (fUSDC, aUSDT, sDAI and LP shares of a Gyroscope LUSD/crvUSD pool). Through time, other bootstrapping pools may be created including on other chains and L2s.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In relation to the long-term aims of Arbitrum’s Treasury diversification program, GYD is exceptionally well placed to showcase ecosystem growth. An ARB allocation could significantly boost the GYD stablecoin supply, with an allocation on the upper-end of the considered scale of 20m USD igniting growth for the GYD stablecoin on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>This would greatly serve to benefit both Arbitrum and Gyroscope long-term. Gyroscope is ideally placed to showcase such ecosystem growth, with an allocation of ARB under the STEP programme serving to supercharge growth alongside Gyroscope’s separate LTIPP and ecosystem grant.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong><br>\nGYD is entirely on-chain. Specifically considering the question of the risks relevant to transactional flows, the risks include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart contract risk: As with any smart contract system, there is an inherent risk that an exploit or bug puts committed assets at risk. This risk can be reduced by conducting code audits and testing, but it cannot be fully excluded.</li>\n<li>Risks of reserve assets: The Gyroscope system is backed by reserve assets, which may include other stablecoins, LP shares in AMM pools, and other tokens. Each of these assets has its own risks, and there is no guarantee that Gyroscope reserve assets always have enough value to fully back the system. More information on stablecoin risks is described, for example, in this paper. More information on LP risks is described in the CLP docs. While these asset risks have been studied (like in the provided links), cryptocurrencies remains a new space in which risks may not be fully understood yet. The Gyroscope reserve may in principle incorporate volatile assets, such as WETH, as future reserve assets. Should this happen, the system may be expected to become under-reserved at times due to the volatility of such assets. Stable assets also contain risks, and a depeg of such an asset could also cause Gyroscope to become under-reserved.</li>\n<li>Price oracle risks: The Gyroscope system relies on a system of price oracles to import asset pricing information from off-chain markets and to read pricing information from on-chain markets. At times, these oracles may provide wrong information or may be manipulated, which may lead to system losses on reserve assets. Oracle risks are described further, for example, in this paper and in the oracle system specification. While the Gyroscope design attempts to mitigate oracle risks, some residual risk always remains.</li>\n<li>Risks of using the DSM: The DSM defines the system’s monetary policy of how reserve assets are used toward maintaining a stablecoin peg. The DSM is designed to balance maintaining a peg with preserving reserve assets in the scenario that reserve assets experience shocks and the system becomes under-reserved. By the design of the DSM (and transparent on-chain), there is no guarantee that users are able to redeem GYD from the system at a value near the peg price at all times. In addition to drawdown risk due to volatility of reserve assets, the DSM may lead to additional drawdown of reserve value. The DSM monetary policy is designed to allow some level of redemptions near the stablecoin peg while the system is under-reserved, which would draw down the overall reserve ratio available for later redemption. This additional drawdown depends on the level of inflows and outflows that the system experiences while under-reserved and on the calibration of the DSM. The DSM is designed to be bounded by a DSM parameter, as described in the DSM technical paper.</li>\n<li>Bootstrapping pool risk: GYD is launched with a ‘bootstrapping pool’, which allows a pre-set amount of GYD to be minted in a simplified manner against a specific reserve asset. The bootstrapping pool structure bypasses the normal Gyroscope minting and redemption structure, including the extra minting and redemption safety checks and reserve diversification mechanisms. Should the single reserve asset held in the bootstrapping pool depeg, it would have an outsized effect on the Gyroscope system while the bootstrapping pool is large in comparison to the rest of the system.</li>\n<li>Upgradeability risk: Many contracts forming the GYD stablecoin system are upgradeable, meaning that the smart contract code may change over time. While it is intended that smart contract upgrades for GYD would fix any code bugs that may materialize, upgrades may also introduce new vulnerabilities and have their own smart contract risk.</li>\n<li>Blockchain infrastructure risk: The GYD stablecoin contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, and any interaction with the smart contracts inherits the risks of the Ethereum network.</li>\n<li>UI and blockchain interaction risks: When a user interacts with the Gyroscope system through the Gyroscope web UI, they are exposed to technical risks. While the Gyroscope UI has been carefully reviewed to avoid bugs and vulnerabilities, these cannot be completely excluded. A UI bug may lead to an incorrect transaction being generated, or the UI may become unavailable. A user’s own IT setups (e.g., web browser, wallet software) may further contain bugs and vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any of the above risks can lead to a partial or complete loss of the user’s assets.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps, OTC agreements?)</strong><br>\nNo</p>\n<p><strong>8. List all the third party counterparties linked to your assets including and not restricted to prime broker if any, custodian, reporting agent, banks for derivatives or loans and provide primary contact details for the third party counterparties</strong><br>\nN/A</p>\n<p><strong>9. Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong><br>\nThe central design aim of the Gyroscope protocol and stablecoin is to minimize and diversify risk to the greatest extent possible. At the center of GYD is a novel all-weather stablecoin design. It is designed to be fully backed by a basket of assets with fundamental innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level.</p>\n<p>GYD’s risk management innovations aim to segment and contain risks from across the asset space and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated risk diversification rules,</li>\n<li>Optimized minting and redemption bonding curves that guide the protocol on how to use reserve assets to maintain stability,</li>\n<li>A new resilient oracle and circuit breaker system that handles stress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GYD is designed to protect against the main risks of holding stablecoins, placing risk control at a high degree of automation in a decentralized, non-custodial way. It serves as a principled risk control layer for stablecoin holders. GYD, which aims to form the safest on-chain stable asset, implements these design principles.</p>\n<p>At the smart contract level, a number of safety checks are performed as part of every minting and redemption operation. Further information is available <a href=\"https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/stablecoin/reserve-safety-checks\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Circuit Breakers. The Oracle system has a series of circuit breakers that are designed to protect the application protocol in case faulty oracle information makes it through the consolidation mechanism as well as providing protection against more general risks, such as mitigating the effects of smart contract bugs.\n<ul>\n<li>Flash Crash circuit breaker. If oracle prices as reported by Chainlink change by more than a threshold in a given amount of time, then the flash crash circuit breaker initiates safety mode in the protocol.</li>\n<li>Excessive flow rate circuit breaker.  Other circuit breakers initiate a safety mode, which is a pause of protocol operations over a set time period. It is designed as a last resort to protect against oracle exploits as well as smart contract bugs and unknown exploits. It operates by measuring ultra-short term flows within the protocol and triggering safety mode if they would exceed thresholds. Atomic exploits are also limited by adding a respective threshold amount.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Dynamic Stability Mechanism (DSM) can be paused. The DSM is an automated market maker that defines minting and redemption of stablecoins against reserve assets. The circuit breaker parameters can be calibrated by taking into account the manipulation costs of the price checks in the consolidation mechanism.</li>\n<li>Oracle guardian mechanism. A DAO-elected whitelist of oracle guardians can initiate safety mode for a defined period of time. The DAO is able to replace the list of guardians at any time. This mechanism is designed as an emergency response lever, which only has pause control, and is intended to be activated in the event of an oracle failure or if a smart contract bug is found.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Performance reporting</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

Anyone will be able to observe the performance of sGYD live either through a front-end application such as a Dune dashboard (<a href=\"https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope</a> will feature sGYD performance information). By design, the reserves will be transparently observable on-chain; showcasing the core value propositions of DeFi, it is not necessary to trust third parties to correctly store the reserves.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Who provides the performance reports in respect of the underlying assets?</strong><br>\nOverall, performance of the underlying assets will most straightforwardly be observable on-chain or via dashboards such as provided on Dune. In respect of the RWA components of the underlying assets themselves (subject to change as the underlying assets evolve):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fUSDC: primary source <a href=\"https://ondo.finance/ousg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OUSG</a> yield. OUSG deposited in BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), with the remainder in BlackRock’s FedFund (TFDXX), bank deposits, and USDC for liquidity purposes. The OUSG portfolio may, in the future, include other US Treasury funds and/or direct investments in US Treasuries.

Describe any formal audit process and timing of such audits.</strong><br>\nIn an on-chain environment, anyone is able to audit the state of the GYD reserve in real time as all data is transparently and publicly available. One visualization of the GYD reserve is made available at app.gyro.finance and other dashboards are available.<br>\nSeparately, as detailed below, the protocol has undergone very extensive code audits.</p>\n<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Provide a copy of your standard contract, or one similar to what is being proposed here.</strong><br>\nN/A as this is a noncustodial solution.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Fee summary: Inclusive of the full scope of services requested. Product Fee schedule If asset based Fee calculation for our plan if asset based Annual fee if flat fee Any other fees (including redemption or minting fees)</strong><br>\nLargely N/A aside from fees set at the protocol level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minting fees: 0bp</li>\n<li>Redemption fees: fUSDC vault (2bp); aUSDT vault (3bp); sDAI vault (3bp); ECLP vault (5bp).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Describe frequency of fee payment and its position vis-a-vis payment priority compared with other expenses (i.e., cash waterfall)</strong><br>\nMinting and redemption fees are paid for each minting and redemption operation. So for a single mint of GYD with ARB, the minting fee would be paid once. Likewise for a redemption. These fees accrue to the reserve backing GYD.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart Contract/Architecture</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. How many audits have you had and name of auditors?

Is the project permissioned? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong><br>\nTrue to the core value propositions of DeFi in general, the on-chain GYD is fundamentally permissionless. Any address is able to mint or redeem GYD through the smart contracts. In relation to the Oracle Guardians, a whitelist of addresses is able to pause minting (but not redemption) of the protocol. This is a security measure to allow minting to be paused if suspicious activity is detected.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross chain interactions?</strong><br>\nAt the time of writing, GYD has been bridged to Polygon zkEVM.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong><br>\nGYD’s largest use case today is as an asset in LP strategies, many of which are supported by Balancer and Aura. Several other protocols integrate GYD as a pairing asset for secondary market liquidity. This includes Aave GHO in collaboration with Tokenlogic and Karpatkey as well as upcoming integrations with Frax, Mimo paUSD, and PrimeDAO D2D.</p>\n<p>Further integrations in lending markets on Ethereum and Arbitrum are also underway.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong><br>\nGYD is to be governed entirely on-chain by the Gyroscope DAO. Various stakeholders in the Gyroscope community control the system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>holders of the Gyroscope protocol’s native governance token, GYFI;</li>\n<li>holders of the Gyroscope stablecoin who provide it as trading liquidity;</li>\n<li>Founding Members of the protocol, community members who have been involved since the beginning;</li>\n<li>Councillors, parties with expertise in DeFi protocol management;</li>\n<li>other DAOs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Votes can also be delegated.</p>\n<p>Participants in the governance system make proposals, which are discussed and voted on. Some changes need more voters (higher quorum) and of the voters, a higher proportion of agreement in order to pass. This is because some governance actions are low-risk and routine, such as deciding on the recipient of a community grant, while others are high-impact and may implement changes to the entire protocol.</p>\n<p>Proposed changes are subject to a timelock - a waiting period - before they are implemented. This is a protective measure to ensure that protocol participants have time to react to any changes they don’t agree with.</p>\n<p>Since the risk of code bugs cannot be fully mitigated, it is important that both the Gyroscope community and the development team at FTL Labs, who was mandated to deliver v1 of the protocol, are able to quickly address smart contract issues that may be found. For this reason, a centralized control multisig will temporarily retain control of the system parameters and protocol update and design decisions in parallel with decentralized governance. This multisig is led by the Gyroscope Foundation, a foundation company associated with Gyroscope governance.</p>\n<p>Following full decentralization, this centralized control vector will be removed, and further updates to Gyroscope contracts will have to be enacted by Gyroscope governance. This is fundamentally important to launching Gyroscope as a decentralized protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token?

FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXB tokens are only convertible to FRAX stablecoins; they do not guarantee FRAX peg, FRAX value, or yield/interest denominated in any other asset except FRAX. FXBs do not entitle holders to any asset off-chain or on-chain (other than FRAX stablecoins). Thus, FXBs are not redeemable for US Treasury Bills nor any real-world asset, are not directly backed/collateralized by them (or any specific asset), and do not have any utility except trustlessly converting to FRAX stablecoins at the pre-programmed maturity timestamp generated at their minting. This is important and not merely a semantic distinction because it directly defines the normative and economic property of FXBs. Frax Bond tokens only guarantee that they convert to FRAX on a one-to-one basis through smart contracts that issue them.</p>\n<p>While 1 FXB will always equal 1 FRAX, the FXB AMO auctions off FXBs at a discount to face value; this discount provides buyers with the equivalent of RWA yield without assuming RWA risk.</p>\n<p>FXBs allow the formation of a yield curve to price the time value of lending FRAX back to the protocol itself. Each FXB token is a fungible ERC20 token deployed from an on-chain factory contract. Immediately at the minting time, FRAX stablecoins are minted into the FXB redemption contract for conversion on maturity. This prevents any external actions from being necessary for the complete FXB cycle to occur and entirely remains trustless. Multiple FXB series can be circulating at all times (decided by frxGov), and there is no limit for the minimum or maximum maturity timestamp for FXBs deployed from the factory.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/6/6919115d8e7d2748c960e12e63187b69d23b475b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/eZJQcAdvVsbVavidqoiMVBU43dF.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6919115d8e7d2748c960e12e63187b69d23b475b_2_624x317.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"eZJQcAdvVsbVavidqoiMVBU43dF\" width=\"624\" height=\"317\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6919115d8e7d2748c960e12e63187b69d23b475b_2_624x317.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6919115d8e7d2748c960e12e63187b69d23b475b_2_936x475.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6919115d8e7d2748c960e12e63187b69d23b475b_2_1248x634.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E6E6EF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>FXBs underlying assets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RWA\n<ul>\n<li>US Treasury Bill maturity equivalent to FXB timestamp</li>\n<li>Short-dated United States treasury bills</li>\n<li>Federal Reserve Overnight Repurchase Agreements</li>\n<li>USD deposited at Federal Reserve Bank master accounts</li>\n<li>Select shares of money market mutual funds</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fraxlend LP (Based on Fraxlend AMO allocation restrictions)</li>\n<li>Curve Stable Pools LP</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c43d8fccec945cb3a5bebc815d739aa5e58f5990.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/s01tJwOPfhc6NCWM7nmxo0MXP0s.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c43d8fccec945cb3a5bebc815d739aa5e58f5990_2_624x347.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"s01tJwOPfhc6NCWM7nmxo0MXP0s\" width=\"624\" height=\"347\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c43d8fccec945cb3a5bebc815d739aa5e58f5990_2_624x347.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c43d8fccec945cb3a5bebc815d739aa5e58f5990_2_936x520.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c43d8fccec945cb3a5bebc815d739aa5e58f5990_2_1248x694.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D6D7D6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"allocation-among-assets-and-general-investment-guidelines-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#allocation-among-assets-and-general-investment-guidelines-10\"></a>Allocation Among Assets and general investment guidelines</h2>\n<p>sFRAX: 60%</p>\n<p>FXB_20263112: 40%</p>\n<h2><a name=\"targeted-maturity-mix-and-credit-quality-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#targeted-maturity-mix-and-credit-quality-11\"></a>Targeted Maturity Mix and Credit Quality:</h2>\n<p>This mix would likely be the most profitable and diversified mixture of dollar-denominated yield that is hedged against short-term rates going down as possible.

Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Frax Finance, similar to Maker, is a DAO and decentralized protocol. The assets and yields it sources come from partnerships with real-world asset providers and companies. One aspect of Frax Finance that is unique among DAOs is that it has its own horizontal <a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-277-onboard-finrespbc-as-frax-v3s-offchain-rwa-partner/2492\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RWA entity that is a public benefit corporation and onboarded through governance when FRAX v3 launched</a>. This entity that is in the control, oversight, and constant transparency of Frax Core Developers is one (in a number of places) that Frax Finance can hold tbills, RWAs, and receive off-chain yield, which powers both sFRAX and FXBs. Frax Finance also has similar RWA partners as Maker including Ondo, Centrifuge (another applicant for this same program), and more. All RWA partners must adhere to transparency requirements and pass governance by FXS holders &amp; are industry standard top/reputable firms.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yes, both de facto and de jure RWA bankruptcy remote partners are used for Frax Finance’s RWA assets.<br>\nWhile bankruptcy remote is a legal term that is very narrow, meaning that offchain assets are held in the benefit of Arbitrum rather than held as an entity asset, Frax Finance has bankruptcy remote RWA partners/entities identical to leading fiat stablecoins and RWA firms.<br>\nFinresPBC is not bankruptcy remote but is a public benefit corporation meaning that it does not partake in any other business or for profit activity other than serving the Frax Finance DAO for RWA custody. So even in a bankruptcy process, there would be no other customers or entities in line for there sFRAX or FXB holders to be protected from. Thus, it is de facto protected from bankruptcies due to no competing classes of customers existing outside of sFRAX and FXB holders. Other RWA entities that have been onboarded do hold their assets in trust segregated bankruptcy remote structures so assets there that back sFRAX and FXBs are protected as well.</p>\n<p>How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</p>\n<p>Arbitrum would be first and foremost a counterparty to the Frax Finance DAO and holder as a holder of sFRAX and FXBs. Arbitrum’s first assurance and “line of defense” to be assured on the value of the two assets is that the Frax Finance DAO stands by these assets both in terms of restitution &amp; using all available means to recoup funds in the unlikely event of depeg or value loss including its treasury, sales of FXS tokens for cash, and its annual and consistent 8-figure revenues. Secondly, the RWA assets that back sFRAX and FXBs on the Frax Finance balance sheet are a mix of full de jure bankruptcy remote partners and public benefit corporation with no other customer or commercial activity/risk than custodying assets for Frax Finance so such RWA collateral should be straightforward and transparent to retrieve even in the cases of unwinding/insolvency etc (explained above).</p>\n<p>Does the Issuer issue more than one asset?

This feature is particularly advantageous for managing large-volume transactions quickly and efficiently, accommodating sudden liquidity needs or strategic shifts in investment.</p>\n<p>Stability: The underlying asset, FRAX, is a stablecoin that maintains its peg to the US dollar through an overcollateralized backing.</p>\n<p>Settlement Times: The conversion from sFRAX to FRAX is immediate upon unstaking. Subsequent transactions, such as using FRAX to purchase ARB or other currencies, typically settle within minutes, depending on the trading platforms’ liquidity. This rapid settlement is beneficial for dynamic treasury management and operational flexibility.</p>\n<p>FXBs (Frax Bond Tokens)</p>\n<p>Liquidity:</p>\n<p>Pre-Maturity: FXBs can be sold on the open market before their maturity date, providing a degree of liquidity that allows holders to exit their positions if necessary. The liquidity of FXBs in the secondary market depends on the demand and trading volume, which can vary based on market conditions.</p>\n<p>Post-Maturity: Upon reaching maturity, FXBs can be redeemed for their full nominal value, ensuring liquidity is restored to the holder without market impact.</p>\n<p>Stability: FXBs are engineered to maintain a stable valuation with respect to FRAX, where 1 FXB is always equivalent to 1 FRAX. This one-to-one parity ensures that each FXB token inherently carries the value stability of the FRAX stablecoin, which is pegged to the US dollar. While 1 FXB will always equal 1 FRAX, the FXB AMO auctions off FXBs at a discount to face value. This discount provides the equivalent of RWA yield to buyers without the assumption of RWA risk.</p>\n<p>Settlement Times:</p>\n<p>Pre-Maturity Sales: The settlement time for selling FXBs on the open market can vary depending on the liquidity of the secondary market.</p>\n<p>Post-Maturity Redemption: Redemption of FXBs at maturity is immediate upon redemption.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The only blockchain that the proposed assets rely on is Ethereum Mainnet.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps,OTC agreements)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>sFRAX and FXBs do not rely on any specific derivative product but convert to FRAX stablecoins, which is Frax Finance’s flagship dollar-pegged decentralized stablecoin.

Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Frax Finance’s RWA tokens, specifically FXBs and sFRAX, are actively utilized in several other protocols, underscoring their versatility and integral role within the broader DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>FXBs (Frax Bond Tokens)</p>\n<p>Use in Fraxlend: FXBs are utilized as collateral within Fraxlend, a decentralized lending platform developed by Frax Finance. This integration allows holders of FXBs to engage in borrowing activities, using their bond tokens as collateral. This capability enhances the liquidity and utility of FXBs, providing token holders with flexible financial options without necessitating the sale of their holdings.</p>\n<p>Liquidity Provision in Automated Market Makers (AMMs): In addition to lending, FXBs can be used to provide liquidity on AMMs such as Curve. By contributing FXBs to liquidity pools, holders can earn trading fees and other incentives, thus generating additional yield while supporting the market’s depth and stability.</p>\n<p>sFRAX (Staked Frax)</p>\n<p>Collateral for CDPs and Lending Markets: sFRAX serves as collateral in collateralized debt positions (CDPs) and various lending markets. This utility allows users to leverage their sFRAX holdings to engage in further financial activities, such as generating loans or creating leveraged positions in other assets. The use of sFRAX in these capacities highlights its value as a stable yet productive financial instrument within DeFi.</p>\n<p>Liquidity Provision on AMMs: sFRAX is also widely used for liquidity provision on popular AMMs, including Curve and Balancer. This involvement in liquidity pools helps to stabilize sFRAX’s value and ensures its integration into the broader ecosystem of token exchanges. Liquidity providers who stake their sFRAX in these pools benefit from trading fees and liquidity incentives, which can significantly enhance the returns on their staked assets.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system?

As explained in <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/savings/savings\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Angle documentation</a>, participants in Angle savings solution for a stablecoin are automatically allocated 90% of the yield earnings the protocol makes on the backing of this stablecoin, yet if less than 90% of the stablecoins are in the savings solution, then participants of the savings product may earn more than what they would be earning themselves if they were doing the same strategies as the one of the protocol.</p>\n<p>Savings yield therefore varies depending on the utilization rate of Angle savings solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the multiplier effect and the utilization rate?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>utilization rate of the Angle savings contract</strong>: The yield that the protocol distributes to stUSD holders comes from the backing of USDA. Currently, only 27% of the USDA is staked into stUSD, this means that the savings contract utilization rate is low and it allows stUSD holders to earn more.</li>\n<li><strong>earning more with Angle than if the DAO was just holding underlying RWAs</strong>: with Angle’s stUSD, users can earn more than what they would otherwise earn by holding the underlying assets/RWAs themselves</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why is the utilization rate low?</strong></p>\n<p>The current utilization rates on the stUSD and stEUR are low due to competing DeFi integrations that incentivize USDA and EURA holders to deposit their stablecoins in pools rather than staking them with Angle. For example, USDA supply is largely used on Aerodrome (Base Chain DEX) and Morpho rather than being staked.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/026704aa69008e40d9a6d504252ca0e80c51cfb5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lfFzhUsQPOPNiNRKBTOFMnV1nT.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/026704aa69008e40d9a6d504252ca0e80c51cfb5_2_690x382.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"lfFzhUsQPOPNiNRKBTOFMnV1nT\" width=\"690\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/026704aa69008e40d9a6d504252ca0e80c51cfb5_2_690x382.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/026704aa69008e40d9a6d504252ca0e80c51cfb5_2_1035x573.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/026704aa69008e40d9a6d504252ca0e80c51cfb5.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F3F2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Please note that both stUSD and stEUR are separate products linked to the USDA and EURA stablecoins.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></h2>\n<p>This investment will improve both the Arbitrum RWA ecosystem and the DAO’s holding in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eliminate acquisition costs of RWAs for all</strong>: investing in both, or either of stUSD and stEUR, gives the Arbitrum Foundation the ability to save on all acquisition costs and overhead related to investing in RWAs. Indeed, Angle Protocol directly supports the acquisition costs of the RWA with Backed Finance. Minting USDA and EURA to benefit from the yield provided by Backed Finance assets only costs the gas fees associated with the transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity, convertibility and no redemption time with USDC:</strong> Please note that USDA and EURA have deep liquidity with USDC and EURC from Circle, and it is possible at all times to mint USDA and EURA with USDC or EURC at zero (0) fees and also burn them for the same tokens for zero (0) fees two from the Angle Price Stability Module.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency: choose an audited, auditable and transparent solution</strong> with institutional grade transparency standards for its ecosystem with real-time analytics available,</li>\n<li><strong>Instant yield, no minimum, no lock-up: provide and get access to both RWAs and a USD yield-bearing stablecoin</strong> allowing instant yield, minimal fees, no lock-up and no minimum deposit,</li>\n<li><strong>Earn more: The Arbitrum Foundation will earn more and improve the return of assets of the DAO</strong> with stUSD compared to just holding bare RWAs thanks to Angle’s multiplier effect (see explanations on the “utilization rate” above). The stUSD yield will not stay at 20% forever but in any case and given the current and upcoming integrations for USDA, it has a high chance of remaining at least above the base US Treasury yield. In fact, the global policy for the DAO is to offer the best of very low DeFi and TradFi yields through the stUSD product.</li>\n<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: by investing in stUSD and stEUR, the Arbitrum Foundation will choose a system that is based on a reliable and predictable automatic design that favors reliability and access to collaterals onchain in case of a black swan event. The Angle stablecoins are also stablecoins that have been reviewed in light of existing regulations (legal opinion available upon request).</li>\n<li><strong>Over-collateralization:</strong> Thanks to the equity buffer in place for both stablecoins, <strong>USDA and EURA are the stablecoins with the highest equity to liability ratio in the industry</strong> (19% for USDA, 15% for EURA) ****and therefore the higher relative amount of first-loss capital.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-13\"></a><strong>2.Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

The protocol has <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/transmuter/mintburn#%F0%9F%93%88-target-price-and-deviation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">important safeguards</a> in place. Failure of some of the oracles on which the protocol relies may lure the protocol into giving away its assets at a deflated value thus leaving the protocol under-collateralized.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"collateral-risk-39\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#collateral-risk-39\"></a><strong>Collateral Risk</strong></h3>\n<p>Angle stablecoins are backed by collateral assets. Within <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/transmuter/transmuter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the Transmuter</a> for instance, these should be denominated in the same currency as that of the stablecoin. For instance, EURA has in its reserves bC3M a tokenized representation of <a href=\"https://www.amundietf.fr/fr/professionnels/produits/fixed-income/amundi-etf-govies-06-months-euro-investment-grade-ucits-etf-dr/fr0010754200\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a Euro ETF</a>.</p>\n<p>Every collateral of a protocol’s stablecoin may pose some relative risk.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"counterparty-risk-40\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#counterparty-risk-40\"></a><strong>Counterparty Risk</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of the collateral assets of the protocol (EURC, USDC for instance relating to Circle or tokenized RWAs relating to Backed) are controlled by centralized entities. There is therefore a counterparty risk related to these entities. Bankruptcy remoteness and the ability to claim the underlying assets of the supported collaterals is an important aspect of the collateral selection process.</p>\n<p>As part of its <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/side-modules/amo\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">direct deposit modules</a>, the protocol invests stablecoins and a portion of its treasury into other protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Morpho for instance).

As part of this system, Angle implements <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/resources/guides/bridge#bridge-limits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">total and hourly limits</a> to further reduce exposure to hacks.</li>\n<li><strong>internal security processes</strong>: the protocol has a “guardian” multisig on each chain on which it is deployed. This guardian multisig is made for time-sensitive situations where it may be necessary to update parameters, pause or unpause contracts functionalities. However please note that the guardian has limited ability to impact the protocol and cannot for example, modify references to an oracle contract and hence manipulate prices to its advantage. Major decision and minor decisions that have not been delegated to the guardian lie with the DAO. Note that it’s this guardian multisig that is responsible for updating the APYs for stEUR and stUSD onchain. The multisig cannot however increase the rate above a threshold defined by governance and decrease it below 0.</li>\n<li><strong>onchain decentralized governance:</strong> Centralization risks can exist within any system, even decentralized protocols. Angle is managed by <a href=\"https://docs.angle.money/governance/angle-dao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a fully onchain governance system</a>, where ownership belongs to a Timelock contract with a 24h delay on each chain where the protocol is deployed. Governance attacks can be mitigated by an emergency multisig (4/6) which has the right to veto decisions that are obvious governance attacks. The Timelock contract ensures that even if “bad” policy decisions are taken by Angle DAO members, any stakeholder has the ability to leave the protocol before changes are actually enforced.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mitigating investment/counterparty/economic risks</strong></p>\n<p>The main following points mitigate investment risks with Angle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a design of the price stability module that centers automatic rebalancing of reserves and target weights in order to avoid exposure to certain assets that would exceed recommendations retained during risk assessments,</li>\n<li>an asset liability management committee with Steakhouse Financial that assesses the risk faced by the DAO and helps Angle governance optimize its balance sheet under hard solvency and liquidity constraints. This committee is what’s behind the recommendation and strict measure of always keeping at least 30% of the backing in liquid assets that can be redeemed/liquidated at T+0.

Boost plans to evolve it’s previous grant by introducing three improvements to it’s previous STIP grant: 1) A more aggressive and active sybil-deterrence strategy using Farcaster as a gated distribution channel, 2) an emphasis on sybil-resistant use cases, and 3) explore third-party incentive managers.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-1-farcaster-growth-opportunity-sybil-deterrence-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-1-farcaster-growth-opportunity-sybil-deterrence-3\"></a>1. Farcaster Growth Opportunity &amp; Sybil Deterrence</h4>\n<p>Farcaster presents an exciting growth opportunity for the Arbitrum ecosystem, as a significant portion of its user base is currently on Optimism and not yet active on Arbitrum. Boost will leverage Farcaster as a sybil-resistance layer, leveraging the fact that participating requires paying for <a href=\"https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/contracts/reference/id-gateway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Farcaster’s FID storage cost</a>. Lastly, Farcaster expands Boost distribution beyond Boost Studios hosted frontends (Boost Inbox, RabbitHole) to include Farcaster via “frames”. Some new advantages of this Farcaster approach are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It enables a targeted “conquest campaign” to attract Optimism’s Farcaster users to bridge over and engage with Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Frames with incentivized calls-to-action like bridging assets or trying Arbitrum apps can drive meaningful user flows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The team has identified 509,923 Farcaster IDs, with 15,881 IDs with Arbitrum transaction history, and 494,042 Farcaster IDs with no Arbitrum history, creating a massive potential for bringing external users to the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This Farcaster user acquisition initiative will run in parallel to broader sybil deterrence efforts like whitelisting/excluding addresses based on sybil probability scoring. Combining a sybil-resistant channel like Farcaster with aggressive mitigation tactics allows Boost to drive an influx of authentic new users at scale.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-objective-and-use-case-based-campaigns-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-objective-and-use-case-based-campaigns-4\"></a>2. Objective and Use-Case based campaigns</h4>\n<p>In parallel, Boost will double down on some of the exciting and novel use cases highlighted in the previous <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rabbithole-retro-stip-analysis-4-1-2024/22955\">Retro STIP Analysis report</a> and leverage aggressive whitelisting strategies such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trading Volume Growth\n<ul>\n<li>Boosting trading volume on Camelot DEX by incentivizing minimum swap amounts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Governance Participation\n<ul>\n<li>Incentivizing ARB token delegation to increase participation in Arbitrum governance</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>User Targeting\n<ul>\n<li>Attracting users from competing ecosystems (e.g. Optimism’s perpetual traders) to Arbitrum platforms</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>User Engagement\n<ul>\n<li>Boosting engagement for creators and NFT collections on Zora marketplace</li>\n<li>Incentivizing “free mints” of NFTs to drive organic mints and earnings for creators</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This multi-pronged approach of sybil-resistant acquisition channels and novel incentive use cases aims to drive sustained user growth and engagement securely.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-3-leveraging-third-party-incentive-managers-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-3-leveraging-third-party-incentive-managers-5\"></a>3.

Basics and background</h2>\n<p>Before answering the question, here is a brief of DigiFT:</p>\n<p>DigiFT is the <strong>first regulated on-chain exchange</strong>, approved as a Recognized Market Operator with a Capital Markets Services license by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) since December 2023. DigiFT allows asset owners to issue blockchain-based security tokens and investors can trade with continuous liquidity via an Automated Market Maker (AMM).</p>\n<p>At the moment, DigiFT’s smart contracts are <strong>on Ethereum and Arbitrum</strong>, and we are seeking partnership with leading Layer 2 ecosystem to better leverage efficiency of the underlying technology.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-how-will-this-investment-improve-arbitrums-rwa-ecosystem-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-1-how-will-this-investment-improve-arbitrums-rwa-ecosystem-5\"></a>1. How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</h3>\n<p><strong>Asset diversification:</strong>  This is straightforward, cryptocurrencies are too volatile for treasury management which target stable and safe yields. As a regulated security token exchange, DigiFT is able to bring traditional capital markets onchain and let Arbitrum ecosystem get access to diversified high quality assets that are uncorrelated with cryptocurrencies, and meet various demand of traditional assets from the Arbitrum communities.</p>\n<p><strong>Institutional adoption:</strong> As a regulated financial institution, DigiFT is in constant conversation with major financial institutions and regulators. DigiFT will be an advocate with regulators and financial institutions, to draw their awareness and increase their adoption of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Building a next-generation security token exchange on tier-one layer 2:</strong>  This is our mission. We want to leverage Ethereum and Arbitrum’s security to build the next generation of capital markets with higher efficiency, more transparency, and less middle-layer cost. By deploying the DigiFT exchange on Arbitrum blockchain, Arbitrum communities can trade diversified capital market products directly on-chain with instant settlement.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-6\"></a>2.Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

Centrifuge has since been developing the ecosystem and demand for RWAs on Arbitrum, starting with a webinar with Offchain Labs co-founder Steven Goldfeder in November sharing the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/events/7125924551783297024/comments/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vision for bringing RWAs to Arbitrum</a>. Centrifuge is fully operational on Arbitrum and ready to accept investments from day one.

A partnership in this capacity would further the network effects of our relationship by connecting both ecosystems. The Centrifuge ecosystem consists of issuers and liquidity providers, which the Arbitrum ecosystem can onboard at any time.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"tvl-on-the-most-trusted-rwa-protocol-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tvl-on-the-most-trusted-rwa-protocol-8\"></a>TVL On The Most Trusted RWA Protocol</h4>\n<p>An investment through Centrifuge’s platform will bolster RWAs on Arbitrum by bootstrapping network liquidity for one of the largest RWA protocols onchain. The Stable Treasury Endowment Program was set up not only to improve treasury health, but to strengthen projects built on Arbitrum. Using Centrifuge will grow RWA TVL on the Arbitrum network on the most well-recognized RWA protocol. Bootstrapping liquidity on Arbitrum would also further the case for building DeFi primitives composable with our permissioned tokens on the Arbitrum network itself.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"start-with-treasury-bills-expand-beyond-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#start-with-treasury-bills-expand-beyond-9\"></a>Start With Treasury Bills, Expand Beyond</h4>\n<p>Centrifuge is asset agnostic, meaning we do, and will continue to support diversified, high-quality RWA credit asset managers and issuers. As Arbitrum develops beyond phase-1 in the STEP program, Centrifuge will be able to play a key role as a one-stop solution for onchain credit. By onboarding Centrifuge, the path to other assets becomes a more seamless journey.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"introducing-anemoy-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introducing-anemoy-10\"></a>Introducing Anemoy</h4>\n<p>Anemoy is a web3 native asset manager built on Centrifuge. The Anemoy <a href=\"https://www.anemoy.io/funds/ltf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Liquid Treasury Fund</a> (LTF) is a regulated, fully onchain actively managed fund for direct access to &lt;6 month US Treasury Yield. The fund is approved and regulated by the BVI Financial Services Commission (BVI FSC). The fund <a href=\"https://app.centrifuge.io/pools/4139607887\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">TVL is $9.7M</a> and has committed allocations of an additional $10M from GnosisDAO and $20M from Frax.</p>\n<p>Centrifuge proposes that the The Stable Treasury Endowment Program starts with an allocation to Treasury bills through Anemoy. Anemoy is waiving all management fees (15bps annually) on the Arbitrum Network starting from when the Arbitrum Foundation subscribes to the fund, ending May 1st, 2025. This is a move to not only attract the Foundation, but also incentivize other players on the network as a whole. Additionally, all third-party service provider fees are waived until the AUM reaches 50M USDC (currently 9.7M USDC). This brings fees to zero initially, and very low thereafter.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><a name=\"identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-11\"></a>Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

Some relevant partners to Arbitrum include MakerDAO, BlockTower, Aave, Frax, and GnosisDAO. Centrifuge is happy to facilitate introductions between organizations as requested. Brief descriptions of our work below:</p>\n<p>MakerDAO:</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2022 we proposed alongside institutional lender, BlockTower, to launch a $220M securitization pool on Centrifuge. The underlying assets were made up of senior loan positions in invoice financing, trade finance, or other short term receivables. Today, BlockTower pools on Centrifuge have around $190M in assets. The BlockTower arrangement was the first time a credit fund’s operations had been brought onchain, requiring immense legal and operational work to bring to fruition. Much of our DAO protocol work since has taken learnings and structures from this arrangement to implement elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Centrifuge began working closely with MakerDAO in 2020 when our first real estate credit pool was <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ns-drop-mip6-application-new-silver-drop-real-estate-backed-loans/3477\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposed</a> with New Silver. Since then, New Silver has launched another pool with MakerDAO titled New Silver II, where they got a debt ceiling increase from $20M to $50M.</p>\n<p>Aave:</p>\n<p>The Centrifuge RWA Market on Aave was launched in 2021 marking the first institutional grade RWA lending market. This allowed users to deposit stablecoins in return for senior or junior tranches of credit directly within the Aave application. The Aave DAO recently has approved to onboard the Aave Treasury into Centrifuge Prime, to allocate an investment into the Anemoy US Treasury Bill fund.</p>\n<p>Celo:</p>\n<p>Celo is another network using Anemoy on the Centrifuge platform to better their long-term sustainability for their treasury. They invest in Anemoy’s LTF and have intentions to diversify into other assets including Flow Carbon’s offset pool. Centrifuge is live on Celo through Liquidity Pools, marking the first use case of our multi-chain product. TVL remains on the Celo network, akin to this proposal with Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>GnosisDAO:</p>\n<p>Some of our newest clients include GnosisDAO, who decided to allocate a portion of their treasury to Centrifuge Prime, mainly the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund. The <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0xa779ccda18ee2aeb56894e8b5baafd3d2568e99b0fea4a03dd246f548084a93c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GnosisDAO proposal</a> includes $10M being allocated. Karpatkey is the financial service provider for GnosisDAO who is now managing the day to day operations of all investments including in RWAs.</p>\n<p>Frax:</p>\n<p>Frax is another DAO that recently decided to onboard the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund. The Frax treasury will be bringing $20M to RWAs as outlined in this <a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-308-onboard-frax-to-centrifuge-prime/2775\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">recent proposal</a>. This is a strong step in the direction of working towards long term sustainability of the DAO in light of ongoing liabilities and ecosystem development.</p>\n<p>Web3 Foundation:</p>\n<p>The Web3 Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that supports Web3 teams and open-source projects through funding, advocacy, research and collaboration, recently <a href=\"https://centrifuge.mirror.xyz/RPd-sjMJLK9W2UYknAM09EJwguxHJci-dbc2msd27MU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">announced their investment</a> with Anemoy on the Centrifuge platform.

A tracking error in this context is the divergence between the price behavior of the LTF tokens, and the underlying prices of portfolio assets. This is not applicable for LTF tokens as the relationship between NAV and token price is identical. LTF tokens do not trade on the secondary market, meaning the only prices come from primary issuance and redemption.

These efficiencies in reporting, operations, and programmability ultimately save money for the end investors through low fees charged by issuers on Centrifuge. On the asset management side, Centrifuge drives efficiencies in reporting allowing all the flow data to be aggregated and act as a single source of truth for back office purposes.</p>\n<p>Diversification:</p>\n<p>Onboarding with Centrifuge allows the Arbitrum Foundation to access a multitude of different asset classes once the program develops beyond stable yields.

Current utility offerings around RWA tokens are insufficient for reputable institutions to interact with from a compliance perspective. We are actively working to integrate them into a few different use cases such as lending and other DeFi primitives. See our recent proposal <a href=\"https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/rfc-launch-an-rwa-lending-market/6346\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">on Centrifuge’s forum</a>. Centrifuge is setting up use cases to allow investors to 1) pledge RWA tokens as collateral to borrow at high LTVs, and 2) gain instant redemptions as lenders are able to buy the short-term liability when users request to redeem shares. This happens in an institutional grade, permissioned environment by all parties interacting with the contracts and the contracts themselves.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"the-anemoy-liquid-treasury-fund-24\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-anemoy-liquid-treasury-fund-24\"></a>The Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund</h4>\n<p>The Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund invests exclusively in U.S T-bills with a maximum maturity of 6-months, and focuses on maximizing interest rates and minimizing price and duration risks.

The assets held in the relevant US Treasury portfolio are exclusively owned by the shareholders that have purchased shares in the fund. Under BVI law, the tokens themselves represent share ownership in the Fund in the same manner as a share certificate. As this is ownership of a segregated portfolio company, all of the assets in the dedicated portfolio (Treasury Bills in this case) are by law owned by the fund shareholders. In case of bankruptcy, these assets would be liquidated and the proceeds would be distributed to tokenholders by operation of British Virgin Islands law.

The management fee is charged daily onchain and paid out from the cash reserve in USDC with a direct impact on the NAV and LTF token price. Charging the management fee started on 3/27/2024. Because there is one NAV being continually calculated regardless of which chain the TVL sits on (as shown in the UI), Arbitrum waived fees will be rebated upon redemption of shares.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4><a name=\"describe-frequency-of-fee-payment-and-its-position-vis-a-vis-payment-priority-compared-with-other-expenses-ie-cash-waterfall-48\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#describe-frequency-of-fee-payment-and-its-position-vis-a-vis-payment-priority-compared-with-other-expenses-ie-cash-waterfall-48\"></a>Describe frequency of fee payment and its position vis-a-vis payment priority compared with other expenses (i.e., cash waterfall)</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The fund administrator calculates fees.

However, the system faced hurdles, particularly regarding the availability of ARB from vesting contracts. Rapid issuance of oARB tokens initially yielded high returns for early depositors, but challenges arose towards the end of the period. As more depositors opted for the non-ETH investment 40-week option, we encountered delays due to the need to taper emissions.</li>\n<li>This experience highlighted the importance of closely monitoring token availability and adjusting emissions to ensure a sustainable and consistent user experience. Additionally, while the requirement for increased ETH and ARB investment faced backlash from farmers accustomed to direct emissions, it was a critical aspect contributing to the success of our strategy. Mandating a vesting ARB and ETH investment commitment helped reduce the number of users taking advantage of the high emissions rate, allowing savvy users to achieve increased yield in a shorter timeframe.</li>\n<li>Overall, this experience provided valuable insights for future iterations that protect the ARB community, emphasizing the need for flexibility and adaptability in incentive programs.</li>\n<li>Going forward we will target a direct incentive approach with dynamic incentives based on where TVL is needed within our vault system.</li>\n<li>Without an oARB system and running two different types of emission schedules we can create a streamlined dune dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>375,000 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved decision making</strong> - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Retaining top performers</strong> - Some ideas and teams won’t produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher self awareness &amp; accountability</strong> - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowers individual contributors</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.</li>\n<li><strong>Removed intermediaries</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone’s compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible information usage</strong> - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source contribution data</strong> - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Self sovereign identity adoption</strong> - Individual contribution logs can be tied to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust based networks</strong> - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they’ve built and the common connections they share.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Read our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution verification and contribution logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/approaches/contribution-verification-approaches\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification approaches</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Experimentation in Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>Individual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants process or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to start building up their own reputation. Idea funding and contributor funding could both experiment with individual contribution logs.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Further investigation</strong></p>\n<p>These is an opportunity to create more tooling that could enable individual contributors to easily record and present their contribution efforts. Contribution logs could become increasingly useful and reliable for contributors to build their reputation in the ecosystem and for voters when making funding decisions.</p>\n<p>In the comings months the Web3 Association is going to look at what tooling already exists that could be used and then explore what new tools could be created to make it easier to record and present contribution efforts.

It’s crucial to highlight that the impact of our STIP is not about ephemeral incentives. Instead, we are strategically deploying funds directly into DAO treasuries to foster long-term, sustainable TVL on the Arbitrum network. Our approach is not centered on short-term fluctuations; rather, we’re committed to enhancing the long-term stability and scalability of TVL on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We aim to cultivate a sticky and lasting TVL within these DAO treasuries on Arbitrum, focusing on the strategic growth of the ecosystem. This will be achieved by strengthening the financial health and governance capabilities of the DAOs involved, as evidenced by monitored metrics such as TVL growth and participatory governance activities incentivized by Tally. We are excited to track these metrics over time</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, we are in close communication with STIP recipients Open Dollar and Pixel Vault, who are expected to augment their DAO treasuries with substantial TVL contributions shortly. We are currently gathering feedback regarding the timelines and specifics of these deployments, which we will include in our final STIP Bridge proposal. Thus far, here are some metrics on the 3 DAO recipients of our STIP: Open Dollar, Content Guild, and Pixel Vault:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TVL in DAOs on Arbitrum incentivized by Tally</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>10/23</th>\n<th>11/23</th>\n<th>12/23</th>\n<th>1/24</th>\n<th>2/24</th>\n<th>3/24</th>\n<th>4/24</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/opendollar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open Dollar</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>41.7k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/content-guild\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Content Guild</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>16.4k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xa1885BFfE760bcCa872D3C34c976Eb0350e3590c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pixel Vault</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>75k (still awaiting our STIP distribution via bridge to Arbitrum Nova)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li>Votes in DAOs on Arbitrum incentivized by Tally</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>10/23</th>\n<th>11/23</th>\n<th>12/23</th>\n<th>1/24</th>\n<th>2/24</th>\n<th>3/24</th>\n<th>4/24</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/opendollar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open Dollar</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/content-guild\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Content Guild</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xa1885BFfE760bcCa872D3C34c976Eb0350e3590c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pixel Vault</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ol start=\"5\">\n<li>[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?<br>\nWe found that it is very difficult to predict how many DAOs will launch on Arbitrum during a specific period of time. Launching on Tally is free and self-serve to launch on Tally, though, so DAO launches are not dependent on our dev capabilities. Publicly, <a href=\"https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-governance-upgrade/3354\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GMX has committed to launching</a> soon and we intend to incentivise their launch in the next STIP round. We are in talks with several other DAOs, whom we cannot name, some for NDA reasons and some because without a public commitment, we are not 100% confident they will launch within the STIP period. We are excited to distribute funds in this STIP round to all DAOs launching on Arbitrum that we see as valuable contributors to the long-term TVL on Arbitrum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?<br>\n200,000 ARB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

To to mitigate this to a certain extent, we shipped an “airdrop points shraing” system - as a part of which, lenders earn 50% of the points from EigenLayer points/ LRT points. This is done to make lending attractive too, and make the status quo appealing to all stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>186,000 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same way* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, we will keep the incentive program unchanged from last time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in term of mechanisms and products?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>N/A</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?<br>\nThe address will be:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisig to receive the incentives: 0x2e39fbb069accd1959d003297250129879eb20a1 (same as last time)</li>\n<li>Contracts that will distribute the incentives\n<ul>\n<li>Strategy Gateway: 0xDc6c3dFb237D5202a8eE4d8472A52A94F9282053</li>\n<li>ysETH.h: 0x092d4BEe60B9F8904918bA7b0341c0B45f16FB55</li>\n<li>ysETH: 0x5ecb93b3ef882bf42fee65541942d50a7dab4b33</li>\n<li>ysUSDC.e: 0x3251f402Cc06b33E742f08E1ADbE0D2E4C1ea2FA</li>\n<li>ysUSDC: 0x97a57663491ba1f0464d587b4b01ed58e49e4109</li>\n<li>ysUSDT: 0x36569fbc5a9d4c59d71e81d46db24256a09d1ad6</li>\n<li>ysARB: 0xab416E57ec74e87295B8a1507745a954B0bB9</li>\n<li>ysWBTC: 0x8e57143d14bae132210cfeec58d0c48875f7d415</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The multisig used to receive the incentives will be the same, while the incentive distribution contract changed compared to STIP</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>Could you share any feedback or suggestion on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall experience was quite positive, with no specific feedback.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stella-stip-addendum/23471\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stella-stip-addendum/23471","pubDate":"Sun, 28 Apr 2024 09:49:01 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23471"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stella-stip-addendum/23471.rss","#text":"Stella STIP addendum"},"filter":false}]}}}
