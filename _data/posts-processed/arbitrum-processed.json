How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Term Finance is an EVM DeFi lending primitive that brings scalable fixed-rate, fixed-term lending through an innovative single-price, sealed-bid auction system, specifically designed to address the volatility and inefficiencies in existing cryptocurrency lending markets.Term’s architecture allows the protocol to onboard both permissioned and permissionless RWAs as collateral (see e.g. Matrixport’s permissioned wSTBT auctions).</p>\n<p><strong>2. Identify key management personnel and individual experience. Also include third parties utilized for managing assets and their qualifications.</strong></p>\n<p>Key contributors to the protocol include the following:</p>\n<p>Dion Chu – Dion is co-founder and CEO at Term Labs. Prior to founding Term, was a trader at Capula Investment Management, a global fixed income specialist firm that manages absolute return strategies, primarily for sovereigns, institutions, and financial intermediaries.

Brief reason for above tracking error</strong></p>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<p><strong>9. Please describe any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organizational structures</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol has strategic partnerships with several onchain projects, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Large upcoming partnerships with on-chain vault strategies managing over $400 million in TVL</li>\n<li>Partnership with Matrixport to enable fixed-rate lending against permissioned RWAs</li>\n<li>Partnership with Lido to offer exclusive incentives to lenders on the Protocol</li>\n<li>Partnership with prominent LRTs (EtherFi) for points integration and bonus points for lenders on the Protocol</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10. What is your entity’s current assets under management, assets held in trust, total value locked, or equivalent metric for your legal structuring?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s TVL is $22m and its volume of transactions is $81.45m.</p>\n<p><strong>11. How many of these assets held are present on Arbitrum One, if any?</strong></p>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<h2>**Plan design** </h2>\n<p><strong>1. Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol enables fixed-rate, fixed-term collateralized loans of cryptoassets, including RWAs for the assets being lent or serving as collateral. The Protocol solves the extreme volatility and rapidly increasing rates in variable rate DeFi markets, which make financing unpredictable and costly for borrowers. Isolated lending pools also enable quick adoption of new collateral types to respond to a rapidly changing market without additional risk to its users.</p>\n<p>The Protocol’s innovative characteristics include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single-Price Sealed Bid Auction Instead of AMM: Instead of using an AMM, Term introduces an innovative auction mechanism that matches lenders and borrowers at a single fixed rate, eliminating slippage and spread issues common in other DeFi lending models.</li>\n<li>Fixed-Rate, Fixed-Term Lending at Scale: Offers stability and scalability in a market known for extreme volatility, enabling both individual and institutional participants to manage and execute financial strategies at scale with predictability.</li>\n<li>Permissioned RWAs: Term is able to support the onboarding of permissioned RWAs as collateral. Term has successfully completed multiple pilot auctions in partnership with Matrixport and their STBT token.</li>\n<li>Isolated Collateral Pools: Each loan is backed by its own segregated collateral pool, enhancing protocol security and enabling customized loan terms and rapid onboarding of new collateral types onto the protocol.</li>\n<li>Capital Efficiency: Unmatched funds are immediately returned to lenders, optimizing capital efficiency and eliminating idle assets.</li>\n<li>Customizable Loan Features for a Variety of Needs: Supports diverse financial needs rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach by allowing customization of loan terms, oracles, and tokens, catering to a wide range of borrowing and lending needs.</li>\n<li>Dynamic Liquidations: Implements an innovative dynamic / soft liquidation mechanism that limits liquidations to the point that take the borrower back to their initial margin ratio - neither too much nor too little.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor or similar rights?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and transparent. Lenders on the Protocol are protected through a collateral liquidation mechanism, specifically an innovative dynamic / soft mechanism that limits liquidations to the point that take the borrower back to their initial margin ratio—neither too much nor too little.</p>\n<p>In addition, each loan is a separate smart contract deployment, which enables isolated collateral pools that reduce the risk of contagion and allows the Protocol to onboard a wider range of collateral types (including RWAs).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is a decentralized collection of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum mainnet and Avalanche (and is expected to be deployed on additional chains, including Arbitrum).</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your own entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes—the Protocol is noncustodial and neither Term Foundation nor any entity or person other than Protocol users themselves own the assets being lent or serving as collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p>Because the Protocol is entirely onchain, Arbitrum’s assets are not exposed to any brokerage or financial institution.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is not an issuer. However, as described above, the Protocol supports a wide variety of cryptoassets for lending and collateral (including RWAs). Lenders with a specific collateral pool are pari passu with respect to any haircuts due to bad debt.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Provide a detailed cash flow diagram that shows the flow of funds from ARB/Fiat conversion, investment in underlying asset, payment of expenses, sale of underlying asset, and repayment (Fiat/ARB conversion), including the counterparties and legal jurisdictions involved.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ARB is converted to a supported cryptoasset (e.g., USDC or a tokenized RWA).</li>\n<li>The cryptoasset being lent is then used to make loan offers in Protocol auctions or placed in a vault or smart contract that does so.</li>\n<li>As loans mature, the proceeds are collected and either retained or rolled into new auctions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above flow is entirely onchain. The only counterparties are Protocol users borrowing in auctions.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>The yield received would likely be considered interest received on a loan. Although the Protocol’s interface geoblocks the U.S. and does not permit U.S. users, the tax treatment in the U.S. may be instructive—loan interest is typically taxed as ordinary income at the federal level.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>Outstanding loans may either be held through maturity or a buyer can be found for the tokens that represent the right to claim loan repayments.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>As explained above, the Protocol socializes losses across all lenders in a specific isolated collateral pool on a pari passu basis.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p>As described above, outstanding loans may either be held through maturity or a buyer can be found for the tokens that represent the right to claim loan repayments. Under these circumstances liquidity depends on factors such as length to maturity. Loan terms are typically 4 weeks and 4 week ladders can be constructed to have weekly liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and has undergone significant real-use and audit testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its smart contracts have undergone multiple security audits with reputable firms like Sigma Prime, Dedaub, and Runtime Verification.</li>\n<li>It has undergone formal verification using Certora’s prover with thorough protocol coverage (over 200 rules and invariants verified).</li>\n<li>It has achieved a 93% rating from DefiSafey for access controls, audit process, and overall protocol monitoring procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>13. Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps,OTC agreements?</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>14. List all the third party counterparties linked to your assets including and not restricted to prime broker if any, custodian, reporting agent, banks for derivatives or loans and provide primary contact details for the third party counterparties</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is noncustodial and neither Term Foundation nor any entity or person other than Protocol users themselves own the assets being lent or serving as collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>15. Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s contributors carefully evaluate new cryptoassets being considered. Factors consider for onboarding collateral assets include 1) Reputable Oracles 2) deep onchain liquidity 3) other factors e.g. withdrawal queues also taken into account.</p>\n<h2>Performance reporting</h2>\n<p><strong>1. What are your proposed performance benchmarks? If this is substantially different from the underlying assets, please explain why.</strong></p>\n<p>Performance should be benchmarked in an asset-specific manner to other lending protocols, such as Aave. Because the Protocol is entirely onchain, performance can be tracked onchain in a transparent manner.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Describe the content, format, preparation process, and cadence of performance reports. This should include proof of reserves, if appropriate. Please include a sample report.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s developers would be able to generate performance reports in a manner to be agreed upon.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Who provides the performance reports in respect of the underlying assets?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol’s developers.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Describe any formal audit process and timing of such audits.</strong></p>\n<p>Because the Protocol is entirely onchain, it does not need to undergo financial audits.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Provide a copy of your standard contract, or one similar to what is being proposed here.</strong></p>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<p><strong>2. Fee summary: Inclusive of the full scope of services requested. Product Fee schedule If asset based Fee calculation for our plan if asset based Annual fee if flat fee Any other fees (including redemption or minting fees)</strong></p>\n<p>Protocol users are subject to two types of fees: a loan servicing fee and liquidated damages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Servicing Fee: Borrowers are charged a loan servicing fee, typically ranging from 0.25%-0.50% per annum on the amount borrowed through Term. The servicing fee is a fee earned by the protocol for processing loans, maintaining records, and monitoring collateral. The fee is quoted as an annualized rate applied to and deducted from any loan proceeds obtained as a result of a successful bid by a borrower.</li>\n<li>Protocol Liquidation Fees: Borrowers in default are subject to liquidated damages (a surcharge), which is applied to any debt covered in liquidation and collected in collateral tokens. Liquidated damages are split between liquidators (typically 5.2%) as a liquidation incentive and the Protocol (Protocol liquidated damages, typically set at 2.8%).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Describe frequency of fee payment and its position vis-a-vis payment priority compared with other expenses (i.e., cash waterfall)</strong></p>\n<p>Servicing fees are paid by the borrower upon disbursement of loan proceeds to a borrower in an auction.</p>\n<h2>Smart Contract/Architecture</h2>\n<p><strong>1. How many audits have you had and name of auditors? Please provide a copy of reports.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and has undergone significant real-use and audit testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its smart contracts have undergone multiple security audits with reputable firms like <a href=\"https://developers.term.finance/deployed-contracts/smart-contract-audits\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sigma Prime, Dedaub, and Runtime Verification</a>.</li>\n<li>It has undergone <a href=\"https://developers.term.finance/deployed-contracts/formal-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">formal verification using Certora’s prover</a> with thorough protocol coverage (over 200 rules and invariants verified).</li>\n<li>It has achieved a <a href=\"https://defisafety.com/app/pqrs/576\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">93% rating from Defi Safey</a> for access controls, audit process, and overall protocol monitoring procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Is the project permissioned? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol can operate in both a permissionless and permissioned manner. For example, the Protocol has a partnership with Matrixport to enable fixed-rate lending against permissioned RWAs. In permissioned assets the protocol also onboards whitelisted liquidators to ensure orderly liquidations. User identities are typically managed through the RWA partner/project’s process.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross chain interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is current available on Ethereum mainnet and Avalanche, with additional chains to be added in the coming months. At the moment there are no cross-chain interactions, but they are being evaluated.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol itself does not have its own RWA tokens. Instead, RWA tokens from other projects can be lent or used as collateral in either a permissioned or permissionless manner.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol is entirely onchain and lending operates through smart contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<p>The Protocol itself does not have its own RWA tokens. Instead, RWA tokens from other projects can be lent or used as collateral in either a permissioned or permissionless manner.</p>\n<h2>Supplementary</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

As an asset that accumulates value and is denominated in USD, mTBILL enables users to borrow traditional stablecoins with higher-than-average loan-to-value ratios while minimizing liquidation risk.<br>\nThis arrangement promotes an influx of stable capital into Arbitrum lending protocols, attracting users seeking favorable rates in the current market environment.</p>\n<p>In isolated pool models, mTBILL enhances interest rates for lenders and borrowers, narrows the rate spread, and offers a method for mitigating bad debt as the collateral asset appreciates. As a permissionless ERC-20 token, mTBILL can be transferred seamlessly in the case of loan default. In single-pool structures, mTBILL can improve rate spreads and boost supply-side yields for traditional stablecoins like DAI, USDC, and USDT.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"capital-commitment-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#capital-commitment-10\"></a><strong>Capital commitment</strong></h4>\n<p>Midas has established an impressive network of investors and co-allocators, including, but not limited to: BlockTower, Framework Ventures, and GSR, who are aligned to utilize and grow the adoption of mTBILL and RWA assets that Midas issues on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>These partners plan to work in concert with Midas to create new opportunities within Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem by providing liquidity in protocols and creating new opportunities for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. We anticipate the activity will create a network effect within the Arbitrum ecosystem, contributing to its long-term growth and success.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"capital-preservation-accumulation-for-the-arbitrum-dao-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#capital-preservation-accumulation-for-the-arbitrum-dao-11\"></a><strong>Capital Preservation &amp; Accumulation for the Arbitrum DAO</strong></h4>\n<p>The investment from the Arbitrum DAO into tokenized treasuries such as Midas mTBILL safeguards the foundation’s financial stability and fosters growth, while also playing a pivotal role in advancing the real-world asset (RWA) ecosystem on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>By leveraging mTBILL, which utilises strategies akin to corporate treasury management, the foundation can diversify its assets and achieve stable financial returns without compromising liquidity or incurring high risk. Simultaneously, this investment enhances the security and stability of the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting its development and resilience against market volatility by integrating real-world financial mechanisms into the blockchain environment.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Arbitrum stands to gain from Midas’s robust legal and regulatory framework used to issue mTBILL, details of which we will explore later in this proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed product, Midas mTBILL, is a regulatory-compliant security token that offers investors on-chain exposure to yield from US Treasury Bills (T-Bills), specifically through the iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF managed by BlackRock. This ETF is comprised of short-dated US Treasury Bills, targeting a maturity mix of 0-1 year to minimize interest rate risk while providing a stable return.</p>\n<p>Given that US T-Bills are backed by the credit of the United States government, the credit quality of the underlying assets is among the highest. The product is designed to 1:1 track the performance of its underlying assets, offering both safety and yield onchain.</p>\n<p>Relevant attachments are included via email.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor, or similar rights?</strong></p>\n<p>mTBILL is a placement of a secured credit by the issuing SPV Midas Software GmbH.</p>\n<p>Investors in mTBILL gain exposure to the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying ETF, ensuring a claim to the financial returns generated from the US Treasury Bills. No shareholder or voting rights are associated with mTBILL.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the legal and contractual structuring for your product including regulatory bodies overseeing your business and the product and identifying all legal jurisdictions interacting with your product. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>Midas mTBILL is issued under German law by Midas Software GmbH, structured as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to ensure compliance with the European Securities Regulation and Anti-Money Laundering law. Midas mTBILL is a secured loan issued by Midas Software GmbH to investors during token issuance. The asset tracks the value of the underlying Blackrock iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF (IB01).</p>\n<p>This setup adheres to regulations in multiple jurisdictions, with specific exclusions for US, China, sanctioned countries, and UK retail investors.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Would Arbitrum’s assets be bankruptcy remote from your entity and its officers/key contributors? If so, please explain the legal and contractual basis. On a confidential, non-reliance basis, provide any third-party legal opinions to support the conclusions.</strong></p>\n<p>Arbitrum’s assets invested in mTBILL are bankruptcy remote due to the legal and contractual design involving an SPV (Midas Software GmbH) and the secure custody of assets by regulated custodians (e.g., Maerki Baumann).</p>\n<p>A security agent (e.g., ATG Azimut Treuhandgesellschaft mbH) acts on behalf of investors to ensure the segregation and protection of assets. This structure is established under German and Swiss law, providing a strong legal basis for asset protection against bankruptcy or adverse events affecting Midas.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The fund shares backing mTBILL are securely ring-fenced and held by a qualified custodian, assuring asset protection in the unlikely event of Midas’ insolvency.</li>\n<li>Assets are held in a segregated brokerage account protected from the custodian’s solvency. Maerki Baumann serves as the licensed Custodian of the assets.</li>\n<li>The appointed security agent acts as trustee to token holders ensuring bankruptcy remoteness. ATG Azimut Treuhandgesellschaft mbH acts as the Security Agent on behalf of investors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6. Does the Issuer issue more than one asset? If so, what is the priority relationship between different asset classes?</strong></p>\n<p>No, not at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>7.

Is the project permissioned? If so how are you managing user identities? Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>The mTBILL token is permissioned to the extent that primary issuance and redemption of the asset require accepted counterparties (e.g. those who have successfully passed KYC and AML checks and have successfully onboarded to Midas).  Yes, there is a blacklist function to prevent sanctioned individuals and operators of scam/fraud operations from utilizing the asset.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is the product present on several chains? Are there any cross-chain interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, mTBILL is available on Ethereum Mainnet. Arbitrum will be the second chain that mTBILL is natively available on.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Morpho has launched a lending market for mTBILL paired with USDC. The USDC RWA-backed Morpho vault enables access to mTBILL yields, arbitrage, and leverage strategies. Morpho Blue is a fast-growing DeFi lending protocol on Ethereum. The USDC mTBILL vault enables USDC to be lent against mTBILL as a collateral asset.</p>\n<p>Midas is working on similar use cases with various other protocols where mTBILL will be leveraged as accepted collateral, given its low volatility and highly liquid backing.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>Pending a successful onboarding, the user’s wallet address is greenlisted. There is an unavoidable degree of trust present when using centralized service providers, but the product has been designed to partition and mitigate risks wherever possible.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<p>No custom logic is required.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"supplementary-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#supplementary-19\"></a>Supplementary</h3>\n<p><strong>1.

In the average monthly user chart above, a significant statistic of 92% of total players were retained.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>While the Arbitrum funding provided invaluable support that helped propagate our game, there was a lack of on-chain metrics in terms compared to other protocols due to the off-chain nature of our game. Tales of Elleria is now enhancing on-chain metrics to convert off-chain players to on-chain activity. We’ve now added mechanics to distribute rewards, incentives, and other tokens on-chain, and forcibly made players interact with Arbitrum to access these rewards so we have more representative on-chain metrics to show in the future.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while the Arbitrum funding provided invaluable support, we realized that we needed to create content and other retention mechanics after our two big game partners, DeFi Kingdoms and Spellborne, brought about a wave of new players, to fully capitalize on our growth. Tales of Elleria strategically enriched its content offerings to enhance player retention and achieved a whopping 91% monthly retention ratio the month after STIP.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7.

The average monthly player count peaked in March, the last world boss event, showing a 70% increase in active player counts since the event started from 1413 average monthly players to 2407 average monthly players.</p>\n<p>A significant majority of the players were also retained as they continued playing Tales of Elleria in April. In the average monthly user chart above, a significant statistic of 92% of total players retained.</p>\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we extend our deepest gratitude to the STIP grant for its pivotal role in Tales of Elleria’s journey. This support provided the essential foundation for our goals, allowing us to innovate and grow in ways we couldn’t have imagined otherwise. However, alongside the grant, we recognized the need to invest additional effort in crafting compelling content with our partners to ensure player retention and engagement. This combination of financial backing, proactive content creation, and partnered project support proved to be a winning formula, resulting in significant achievements for our project.</p>\n<p>Throughout the grant period, we witnessed remarkable strides forward. Notably, our collaborative events with DeFi Kingdoms and Spellborne garnered outstanding success. These partnerships not only expanded our reach but also retained users. The tangible outcomes, including substantial increases in player count, transaction count, and fee generation, underscore the effectiveness of the grant in driving our project’s success. As we reflect on these achievements, we’re inspired to continue our growth of Tales of Elleria.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tales-of-elleria-program-update/23633\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tales-of-elleria-program-update/23633","pubDate":"Fri, 03 May 2024 15:02:44 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23633"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tales-of-elleria-program-update/23633.rss","#text":"Tales of Elleria Program Update"},"filter":true},{"title":"Delegate Incentive Program Results (APRIL 2024)","dc:creator":"SEEDGov","category":"Delegate Incentives Program","description":"<p>We are proud to announce the initial outcomes of the second month of the Delegate Incentive Program.

[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>Even if the program allowed us to grow (1) the Angle TVL on Arbitrum with peak 1753% increase now stabilizing at a 538% increased compared to the begining of the program, and (2) DEX liquidity, the remaining stEUR holders after the program did not necessarily leave their liquidity in the pools created, they keep holding the EURA and stEUR stablecoins but out the pools.  In summary, new holders of the EURA stablecoin remained after the end of the program and a considerable part of them (approx. 50%) kept staking their EURA stablecoin into stEUR to gain the RWA yield associated with it. Indeed Around 1m of EURA are currently staked in the stEUR savings product. However, most of these people pulled their liquidity out the Camelot pools that were set up.</p>\n<p>The integration of stEUR with Silo allowed the onboarding of new EURA and stEUR holders. Integrations and sigle-sided liquidity incentivization on Silo appears to be a good continuation path for this STIP Bridge.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7.

This surplus buffer is made up of the profits the protocol has built since its launch in November 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Borrowing Facility on Morpho</strong>: For USDA, Angle delegated its borrowing facility to a Metamorpho vault curated by Gauntlet by pre-minting USDA in it. This is functionally equivalent to having a borrowing system on its own. The choice to delegate the borrowing infrastructure of USDA to the Morpho system holds benefits in terms of distribution, helps to benefit from the expertise of a reputed third party as Gauntlet and still allows the protocol to manage its risk on Morpho by proposing to adjust debt ceilings. To this date, the protocol has minted $3M USDA in the form of Automatic Market Operations (AMO) for seeding purposes in the Morpho vault curated by Gauntlet. This is always trackable in <a href=\"https://analytics.angle.money/collaterals\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the real-time analytics and balance sheet </a> provided by Angle.

This is also always trackable in <a href=\"https://analytics.angle.money/collaterals\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the real-time analytics and balance sheet </a> provided by Angle.

The yield that the protocol distributes to stUSD holders comes from the backing of USDA. Currently, only 27% of the USDA is staked into stUSD, this means that the savings contract utilization rate is low and it allows stUSD holders to earn more. <strong>Why is the utilization rate low?</strong> The current utilization rates on the stUSD and stEUR are low due to competing DeFi integrations that incentivize USDA and EURA holders to deposit their stablecoins in pools rather than staking them with Angle. For example, USDA supply is largely used on Aerodrome (Base Chain DEX) and Morpho rather than being staked.</p>\n<p>A larger target and user base that the Euro stablecoin: USDA has been launched two weeks ago and currently has a 10m TVL. More generally, USD stablecoins have larger use cases and adoption in Defi, hence the plan to direct the potential STIP bridge funds to the development of use cases around USDA and stUSD.</p>\n<p>After the initial STIP program, an event if Angle registered solid growth numbers in user count, volume, and TVL, it appears that favoring lending and/or perpetual DEX inregrations may be better long term spending for networks effects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The new plan would be to allocate the funds as follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step 1 - 250,000 ARB dedicated to single sided USDA liquidity providers on lending markets including at least Silo,</li>\n<li>Step 2 - 100,000 ARB dedicated to (1) bringing stUSD liquidity on a native perpetual DEX on Arbitrum (Vela Exchange or else) to facilitate more trades, or (2) bringing furthermore USDA liquidity a money market on results observed in Step 1</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incentives distributions on Silo</strong><br>\nAngle will gradually distribute incentives on Silo starting with a lower amount of incentives during the first weeks to avoid incentives collection by a minority of lenders. Incentives will be streamed on a weekly basis in order to monitor and maintain a constant APR.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentives distributions on a perpetual DEX</strong><br>\nThe goal would be to facilitate more trades by bringing further liquidity on a native decentralized Arbitrum perpetual DEX. The incentives would be distributed to reward the liquidity deposited.

[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>During the STIP, we decided to repurpose 100k set aside for partnerships to extend out the juiced vaults for another month. We were not able to find a proper set of partners that were capable to deploy options liquidity mining given the time constraints and resource requirement from the receiving team. If we had to do it again, we would get some commitment prior to the STIP period to lock-in the partnerships. However, given the amount of new projects moving over with LTIPP, it’s doubtful we will run into that problem again.<br>\nWe were also able to develop some new vault types we have not deployed yet as well as a new algo strategy that a few groups are interested in utilizing that should result in some newer exotic options vaults for tokens that do not have a mature spot market yet, which we are excited to deploy soon. We started the cross protocol initiatives to move over liquidity from other chains (SOL) and soon (OP) and with more to come, however the we kind of stink at doing the cross-protocol marketing and end up releasing piecemeal, we could definitely do a better job coordinating between project teams. So if STIP Bridge does get over the line, the items addressed here are what we would course correct this time around to continue to develop our relationships with other projects across the ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a name=\"vaults-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#vaults-3\"></a>Vaults</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>During the STIP, the vaults had an 80% utilization rate. As you dig deeper the majors tokens of ETH and ARB were constantly at 90% utilization throughout the STIP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4><a name=\"traders-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#traders-4\"></a>Traders</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>During and immediately following the STIP, Premia experienced an exponential growth in volume. This was due to the combination of orderbook liquidity coming online, algorithmic traders integrating into our platform, and deep liquidity in the vaults.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-5\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h1>\n<p><strong>7. How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>420,000 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><em>8. Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways</em> as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal? [Y/N]</em>*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>9. [Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning from the previous period, we plan on keeping the allocation percentages largely similar. However, regarding execution, we plan to incorporate different ecosystem tools to boost engagement and reach parties outside of the de facto Options Community. Note that during the STIP, we decided to repurpose 100k set aside for Options Liquidity Mining partnerships to extend out the juiced vaults for another month, as we were not able to find a proper set of partners that were capable to deploy OLM given the time constraints and resource requirement from the receiving team. Given this, we will only incentivize Vaults and Traders this time around.</li>\n<li>The new split will focus on incentivizing foundational desired behavior. This will include incentive programs for makers &amp; takers, vault participants, and project archetype users. The breakdown is as follows\n<ul>\n<li><strong>280,000 Arbitrum tokens allocated to incentivizing vault participants (6/9 as before)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This will allow for more option writing. We will target 6mm in new Liquidity into the vaults</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>140,000 Arbitrum tokens allocated to incentivize makers and takers (3/9)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>With the recent success of trading programs by vertex and dydx we plan to replicate a similar program. They have shown a proven path to attract new traders and increase volume in a healthy and manageable manner.</li>\n<li>Moreover these incentives will help support the soon to launch project archetype. Users will benefit directly from incentivizing takers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Additionally we will be partnering with ecosystem tooling to track engagement and reach parties outside of the de facto options Community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10.

Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall, the experience was very positive and led to a lot of growth in the protocol that we believe can springboard Premia’s further usage.</li>\n<li>Regarding pain points, we did have some lessons to learn regarding allocating for partnerships, described in more detail in item 6 - and this was something on our end that we’re already prepared to correct.</li>\n<li>Juiced emissions are nice for legitimacy scoring (TVL) and vanity metrics - foundational incentivization of desired behavior is where we are starting to reap what we sowed. It all plays into the cycle; higher TVL brings more eyes and rapport, and gets you into conversations</li>\n<li>with participants that can make time and resource investments to make your Defi protocol a success.</li>\n<li><strong>The ultimate goal we planned on solving with STIP rewards (the cold start problem), was knocked out of the park!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"future-plans-for-the-product-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#future-plans-for-the-product-6\"></a>Future Plans for the product</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>We are currently working on what we call Project Archetype. It will be an AA-first defi platform (that uses Premia under the hood) aimed at growing options adoption and defi more broadly by streamlining opinionated defi experiences. It will feature a first-of-its-kind ‘price protection’ feature utilizing options and smart account wallets for smoother onboarding of new users. We are planning to have this ready during the STIP bridge period this summer, and like Premia will be Arbitrum exclusive.</li>\n<li>We are working on a portfolio margin solution. Over the past 6 months the premia team has talked to current users and potential users about the limitations and struggles in the onchain options ecosystem. The universal theme among all conversations has been the need for capital efficiency. Our goal now is to create that capital efficient system with the introduction of portfolio margin.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</h3>\n<p>TrueFi tfBILL helps Arbitrum to achieve its objectives of managing treasury into high-quality, highly liquid assets by providing on-chain access to short-term U.S. Treasury Bill yields.</p>\n<p>Through STEP, Arbitrum and TrueFi can establish a model for successful investment of DAO treasury into “real world assets” using a crypto-native stack that integrates processes of leading off-chain asset managers (Adapt3r Digital) into open, on-chain financial infrastructure (TrueFi).</p>\n<p>As the RWA ecosystem evolves, TrueFi is positioned to facilitate additional RWA activity beyond tokenized T-bills. TrueFi has originated nearly $2B in onchain credit to date (source: <a href=\"http://rwa.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">rwa.xyz</a>), and built generalized credit infrastructure that suits our needs as the asset manager of tfBILL.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic Compliance and Regulatory Leadership</strong></p>\n<p>Consistent with our belief that a tokenized asset is only as strong as the regulatory compliance of its issuer, Adapt3r Digital has crafted tfBILL with a foundational emphasis on compliance. We aim to set the gold standard within the DeFi space for regulatory adherence. This approach not only aligns with stringent financial regulations that come with being a US-domiciled asset manager, but also the investor protections that come with a Professional Mutual Fund registered with the BVI Financial Services Commission. Adapt3r has taken a measured approach to integrations to date, focusing on KYC’d and permissioned ecosystems. By adhering strictly and conservatively to global securities regulation, tfBILL is best positioned to scale with the growth of Arbitrum without interruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Commitment to Decentralization</strong></p>\n<p>With the launch of tfBILL, Adapt3r Digital leverages the TrueFi protocol’s proven track record of nearly $2 billion in loan volume, which is by far the highest volume as well as one of the longest-lasting RWA ecosystems in DeFi. Consistent with Arbitrum’s vision, TrueFi is the only RWA platform managed exclusively by a decentralized community. The integration of tfBILL on Arbitrum also brings TrueFi’s core private credit marketplace, which is relaunching <a href=\"https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-11-rebuilding-a-risk-managed-crypto-native-lending-vertical-on-truefi/1602\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">professionally underwritten pools</a>, as well as a soon-to-debut <a href=\"https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-12-truefi-trinity-a-new-vision-and-roadmap/1620\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">treasury-backed stablecoin </a>to every user in the Arbitrum ecosystem. By offering an entire ecosystem rather than a single asset, TrueFi’s tfBILL is a logical choice for growing Arbitrum without compromising on quality or overall mission of the endowment.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasury Diversification and Composability</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the immediate benefit of investing in US treasury bills, the most liquid and low risk asset globally, the broader TrueFi ecosystem also offers Arbitrum’s treasury a strategic diversification option by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@cicadapartners/cicada-partners-secures-approval-from-truefi-dao-to-serve-as-credit-risk-manager-4d1e3b81fba8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">providing access to alternative credit products</a>, which contain higher yielding opportunities with established managers. This diversification allows the treasury to tap into an alternative asset class that is not only stable and profitable but also managed through robust risk controls and compliance measures, enhancing the overall security and yield potential of treasury assets.</p>\n<p>For more information on the general benefits of tfBILL, please see <a href=\"https://docs.adapt3r.com/adapt3r-digital-docs/qualified-access-products/adapt3r-short-term-us-treasury-fund/us-treasury-bill-yield-now-on-chain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our docs</a> and also find TrueFi docs <a href=\"https://docs.truefi.io/faq\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-6\"></a>2.

Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</h3>\n<p>Our risk management, across both operations and investment activity, centers on the simplicity of our investment approach and product structuring. This simplicity is by design – we believe that complexity breeds fragility.</p>\n<p>tfBILL was built in response to compliance and complexity concerns we continually heard from DAOs and on-chain investors about existing treasury bill offerings. Specifically, many DeFi entities and users expressed difficulty evaluating existing options due to contrived and opaque legal structures with uncertain investor recourse, hidden layers of fees, and aggressive operation in regulatory grey areas.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning, our primary goal has been to build an on-chain treasury instrument that is simple, transparent, and secure for all users.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational Risk Management</strong></p>\n<p>The Fund’s operations are safeguarded by robust internal controls, including consensus-based approval mechanisms and role-based governance protocols.</p>\n<p>For example, by limiting disbursement of funds from the contract to <a href=\"https://github.com/TrueFi-Protocol/contracts-fluorine/blob/main/docs/interfaces/IStructuredAssetVault.md#disburse-1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>onlyAllowedBorrowers</code></a> that are assigned the <code>BORROWER_ROLE</code> by TrueFi governance, tfBILL can ensure that USDC can only be disbursed to approved addresses at Coinbase Prime.</p>\n<p>These measures are bolstered by multi-layered physical and digital security protections. On-chain assets are safeguarded by multi-sig operations and leading custodial providers. Off-chain assets are held in custody with a regulated institutional custodian and a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer.</p>\n<p>Our operational controls are supported by technology solutions including real-time monitoring and alerts, ensuring that any unauthorized access or deviations from established procedures are quickly identified and addressed. Additionally, we engage a reputable fund administrator to oversee daily Net Asset Value calculations as well as an AML Reportig Officer to enforce meticulous KYC, KYB, and AML protocols, further reinforcing our commitment to regulatory compliance and operational integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Investment Risk Management</strong></p>\n<p>The cornerstone of our Investment Risk Management centers ADAPT I LP focuses on maintaining a conservative and strategic approach to portfolio management, investing only in short-term U.S. Treasury bills. Our investment strategy employs a ladder approach by diversifying across different maturities to effectively manage duration and liquidity risks.</p>\n<p>This strategy is supplemented by active internal reviews and monitoring, ensuring alignment with our risk appetite and investment goals. We also conduct extensive research and leverage independent expertise to inform our investment decisions, ensuring that each investment is well-positioned to meet our stringent criteria for risk and return.</p>\n<p>By maintaining rigorous operational controls and a prudent investment strategy, we ensure the safety and performance of our fund.

How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</h3>\n<p><em>Trust-minimized:</em> Full transparency into flow of funds and real time on-chain monitoring. On-chain assets are segregated in cold storage and held by a Qualified Custodian. Off-chain assets are segregated and custodied by a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer. Investors can monitor the manager’s portfolio, yield generation, fees and expenses, and ongoing maturity profile in real-time. Streamlined investor reporting statements are provided by Archblock. Further, investors have real-time visibility of the off-chain U.S. Treasury Bills held by the manager as well as deposits and withdrawals to the Fund. The primary activity that requires trust from our investors is within the subscription/redemption process, whereby Adapt3r withdraws USDC to Coinbase Prime. Adapt3r controls the TrueFi Asset Vault using multi-sig technology, and access is limited to key management personnel. Every other aspect of the flow of funds is trustless and/or highly regulated.</p>\n<p><em>Audits &amp; Attestations:</em> Independent third-party fund administrator NAV Consulting releases daily NAV reports (which are available to investors on Archblock’s frontend), detailing the Net Asset Value of the backing tfBILL’s underlying holdings. ADAPT I LP is subject to annual audits, conducted by Wolf &amp; Company, a recognized fund auditor with deep experience in blockchain fund audit and accounting services. This ensures that ADAPT I LP maintains the highest accounting standards and third party oversight.</p>\n<p><em>Administrator:</em> NAV Fund Administration Group serves as the Administrator for the Fund. The Administrator provides certain accounting, operations and other administrative support for the Fund as preparing quarterly reports, calculating the Fund’s Net Asset Value, providing the registrar and transfer agency services in connection with the issuance and transfer of Interests, performing the required acts relating to the redemption and/or subscription for the Interests and performing certain other administrative and clerical services in connection with the administration of the Fund as agreed among the Fund and the Administrator.</p>\n<p><em>Custodian:</em> The Fund has appointed TradeStation Securities, Inc. as its custodian to custody the U.S. Treasury Bills and may have a separate custodian for the custody of USDC and other consideration paid by Limited Partners. Such custodians have developed security systems to maintain confidential access to private keys that have been generated and which control movement of the Tokens, as applicable. The Investment Manager may not be able to obtain control of the private keys generated by the exchanges utilized by the Fund, because each exchange may use different methodologies and security systems. The Investment Manager seeks to employ a comprehensive due diligence process to select custodians that it determines have developed sophisticated security systems and will continue to reevaluate the due diligence process and security systems of the various custodians.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-6-is-there-any-custom-logic-required-for-your-rwa-token-if-so-please-give-any-details-51\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-6-is-there-any-custom-logic-required-for-your-rwa-token-if-so-please-give-any-details-51\"></a>6.

Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</strong></p>\n<p>We found that the incentive campaign brought in many wash traders, where our intention was to promote real users. We will change the campaign in the bridge version to remove the risk of wash trading by targeting developers and adjusting the economics when targeting end users. This will be beneficial not only for the end user, but the developers and protocols that integrate our API/SDK as well. This is therefore not just a benefit for us, but also all the protocols that build with us in terms of lowering development costs, improved security, better incentives and economic models, and improving their product by offering more features and functions that would otherwise not be available.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<p><strong>7. How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>350,000 ARB</p>\n<p>(200,000ARB will be utilized for rewards for lending dashboard users, and 150k towards protocol rewards to users who utilize Protocolink, such as Radiant’s Unwind feature)</p>\n<p>8.Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</p>\n<p>No</p>\n<p><strong>9.How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<p>It is our intention in this version to promote the use of Protocolink by our partners and developers. If a protocol or developer utilizes Protocolink API/SDK to route transactions, a portion of the overall volume will be incentivized and rewarded. This is different from our previous campaign because we will not only be incentivizing retail users, but builders as well. Therefore we will provide 150k rewards towards user incentives for protocols that route transactions through Protocolink.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, the first change we want to make is to include an incentive to builders who build using our public API/SDK. Protocolink, our API/SDK, is one of the most robust SDK’s in the industry today. Through the composability of Furucombo, Protocolink allows developers to take advantage of the functions and features available through Furucombo, such as advanced position management, zap in/out of lending positions, multi-send, and more. Additionally, by a developer or protocol utilizing Protocolink, we can significantly reduce the cost of development for developers, as well as reducing security risks. Through our studies, we have calculated that developers can save approximately 77% development costs by utilizing Protocolink for their Lending SDK needs. This can be demonstrated by our collaboration with Radiant protocol who is utilizing our API/SDK to unwind positions directly on their interface. These rewards will incentivize developers to utilize Protocolink so that they can provide rewards directly to their users through the integration. We believe that this can help to strengthen the developer community on Arbitrum and act as an incentive to develop more outstanding dapps to deploy on chain due to the developer friendly environment.</p>\n<p>The second change will be to focus on how we can avoid wash trades on Furucombo, and to promote real users. This began to happen once the $ARB token saw a big price swing and it was profitable to perform trades to earn tokens. We still want to provide incentives to users, but we noticed that a volume based approach for all functions on the Lending Dashboard caused the back and forth trades from occurring. Therefore we will focus again on the advanced features, such as Collateral Swaps, Debt Swaps, Leverage, and Deleverage. Additionally, we will adjust the rewards based on the token amount (instead of price), to target a specific percentage of rewards. Furthermore, we will provide users with gas incentives. Because of the complex transactions when performing position management, gas fees can vary anywhere from a few dollars to as high as over five dollars. By providing gas incentives, it will allow users to be able to manage their positions without having to worry about the cost of performing the transactions on the network. With these changes, we believe this will greatly reduce the back and forth swaps and will focus more attention on real users attempting to adjust their positions.</p>\n<p>The goals for this campaign will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>KPI 1 - Increase volume through the Protocolink API through our partner integrations (such as Radiant’s Unwind feature) by providing user incentives</li>\n<li>KPI 2 - Increase real volume on users doing position management advanced actions (collateral swap, debt swap, leverage, and deleverage)</li>\n<li>KPI 3 - Increase the amount of users that are able to use these functions (~50% increase, previously we seen a 57% increase)</li>\n<li>KPI 4 - Add more protocols that utilize the Protocolink API/SDK for transactions (&amp; provide incentives to those users)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final details will be determined upon the creation of this campaign including recommendations from the community and Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>10.Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisig Address\n<ul>\n<li>0x99D40438543041e3CC53ac1fE8FF2B8f68996C79</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>11.Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n<p>Overall the experience was good. It would be nice to be able to assign incentives based on our own schedule, as opposed to staying static to an overall schedule. We believe that we could have run the previous round of rewards for a longer period of time, and therefore could have provided incentives for longer. Other than that, we really appreciate that Arbitrum is focusing on developer incentives and providing us the ability and opportunity to continue to build and provide the best possible experience for users for managing their positions, and performing transactions in DeFi.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/furucombo-stip-addendum/23599\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/furucombo-stip-addendum/23599","pubDate":"Thu, 02 May 2024 08:47:32 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23599"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/furucombo-stip-addendum/23599.rss","#text":"Furucombo STIP Addendum"},"filter":false},{"title":"Ondo Finance: Ondo I LP (OUSG) STEP Application","dc:creator":"Boulder17","category":"STEP Applications","description":"<p><strong>Applicant information</strong><br>\nName: Ondo I LP<br>\nAddress (Headquarters): 500 W Putnam Ave Ste 400<br>\nCity, State, Postal Code: Greenwich, CT, 06830-6096<br>\nCountry: US<br>\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://ondo.finance/ousg\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OUSG | Ondo Finance</a></p>\n<p>Primary Contact<br>\nName: Katie Wheeler<br>\nTitle: VP of Partnerships<br>\nCountry: US<br>\nEmail: Katie.Wheeler@Ondo.Finance<br>\nTelegram: <span class=\"mention\">@Katie_Wheeler</span></p>\n<p>Key Information<br>\nExpected Yield: 4.96% APY as at 04/30/24</p>\n<p>Expected Maturity: OUSG does not have a maturity.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong><br>\nAt Fortunafi we fundamentally believe that in order to successfully scale an RWA ecosystem, composability with DeFi is a critical ingredient. Given Arbitrum’s success in scaling DeFi we believe that Arbitrum is extremely well positioned to be the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span> chain for RWA. Fortunafi has been working closely with Arbitrum on implementing a best in class solution for native RWAs on Arbitrum. We believe Fortunafi is the only offering that enables all of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Native Minting &amp; Redemption on ARB</li>\n<li>Fully Compliant Composability with DeFi\n<ul>\n<li>Fortunafi is in discussions with leading protocols on Arbitrum including but not limited to: Jones DAO, Isekai, Gammaswap, Silo, IPOR, and Radiant.</li>\n<li>Transferability enabled for all whitelisted users &amp; protocols</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Open to US &amp; Non US</li>\n<li>Open to individuals &amp; entities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fortunafi’s wealth of experience in both traditional finance and DeFi grants us the expertise to bring compliant products onchain that facilitate great composability with many existing protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem. We have been actively collaborating with Arbitrum native protocols for over a year to develop novel yield strategies, new collateral types for lending, and exposure to off-chain yields and other traditional products. Members of the team are highly invested in the Arbitrum ecosystem, greatly align with the vision of creating a composable decentralized financial ecosystem, and are highly motivated to provide the highest quality collateral to the protocols and users of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4c1aaf396b6a2186cd497dd1c440d6f0232baf78.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/aRfssgJVPpA8P5yi7SiuFPQU5x6.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4c1aaf396b6a2186cd497dd1c440d6f0232baf78_2_624x361.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"aRfssgJVPpA8P5yi7SiuFPQU5x6\" width=\"624\" height=\"361\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4c1aaf396b6a2186cd497dd1c440d6f0232baf78_2_624x361.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4c1aaf396b6a2186cd497dd1c440d6f0232baf78.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4c1aaf396b6a2186cd497dd1c440d6f0232baf78.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"E2E6E2\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>2.

As a company, Fortunafi was the 2nd ever protocol to receive approval from MakerDAO to use RWAs as collateral for minting DAI, was an early user of Centrifuge launching two separate pools backed by a variety of private credit assets, and worked closely with key contributors at Canto to pass governance proposals to use $fBILL and $ifBILL tokens to back their native stablecoin.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What is your entity’s current assets under management, assets held in trust, total value locked, or equivalent metric for your legal structuring?</strong><br>\n$7.2 million</p>\n<p><strong>11. How many of these assets held are present on Arbitrum One, if any?</strong><br>\nCurrently $500,000 of tokenized treasury bills ($fBILL) are held on Arbitrum One.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"plan-design-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#plan-design-5\"></a><strong>Plan design</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>1. Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Structure</strong><br>\nThe product uses a “master-feeder” fund structure. The Master Fund, Fortunafi Capital LP, is a British Virgin Islands limited partnership. Non-U.S. investors are able to subscribe to interests in Fortunafi Capital International LP, a BVI limited partnership (the “Offshore Fund”), and U.S. investors may subscribe to interests in Fortunafi Capital US LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Onshore Fund” and together with the Offshore Fund the “Feeder Funds”, and together with the Master Fund the “Funds”). The Feeder Funds invest substantially all of their assets through the Master Fund.</p>\n<p>The Funds are not registered, in reliance on Section 3(c)7 of the Investment Company Act. Interests in the Funds will not be registered with the SEC in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.</p>\n<p>The Funds are operated by Fortunafi Capital GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as General Partner. The Investment Manager of the Funds is Fortunafi Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong><br>\nInvestors are able to subscribe to the Feeder Funds using Fortunafi’s Tokenized Asset Protocol (“TAP”). To do so, investors must undergo an onboarding process. Once the onboarding process is completed, investors can use TAP to purchase interests in the Fund’s Class T-Bill, which will be represented by token units named fBILL for the Onshore Fund, and ifBILL for the Offshore Fund (together the “fTokens”).</p>\n<p>Onboarding process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>KYC/AML and Checks: user connects wallet to TAP and undergoes a process of identification and other checks. U.S. users also undergo an accreditation check.</li>\n<li>Subscription Documents: users that pass Step 1 receive subscription documents to complete.</li>\n<li>Whitelisting: Once Steps 1 and 2 are complete and approved, the user’s address is whitelisted.</li>\n<li>Chain Selection: user is now able to select from various chains and invest in Class T-Bill interests, minting fBILL or ifBILL tokens directly on the selected chain. Currently, available chains on TAP are Arbitrum, Blast, and Canto.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Funds’ net asset value is calculated daily and the value of the fBILL and ifBILL tokens will change with the net asset value of the Class T-Bill interests.</p>\n<p>Subscriptions are processed and tokens minted on the same business day they are requested through TAP, with a 2:00pm ET cut-off. After the cut-off, subscriptions are processed the following business day.</p>\n<p>Redemptions may also be requested by using TAP, with same business day processing done before the 2:00pm ET cutoff, if there is available liquidity in the Funds. Otherwise, redemptions are expected to be processed the following business day. Subscriptions and redemptions may be done in USDC or USD.</p>\n<p><strong>Underlying Assets</strong><br>\nThe Class T-Bill invests primarily in debt and fixed income securities issued by the United States Department of the Treasury (“Treasury Bills”) with up to 12 month maturity. It may also invest in exchange-traded funds that primarily pursue or track investments in Treasury Bills.</p>\n<p>Current holdings of the Class T-Bill portfolio:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>CUSIP</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Maturity Date</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>912797JV0</td>\n<td>US Treasury Bill</td>\n<td>5/07/2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>912797JX6</td>\n<td>US Treasury Bill</td>\n<td>5/21/2024</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>2. Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor or similar rights?</strong><br>\nInvestors own limited partnership interests in Feeder Funds, and are therefore owners of the Funds. The Feeder Funds in turn hold limited partnership interests in the Master Fund. All bank accounts and brokerage accounts are in the name of the Master Fund. The Funds are the counterparty to the service providers, which act in the interest of the Funds.</p>\n<p>The fund structure is bankruptcy remote from the Investment Manager. In the event the General Partner is dissolved or declares bankruptcy, the Funds would be dissolved and liquidated, with each investor receiving their respective interests in USDC or USD.</p>\n<p><strong>3.

Each investor in the Onshore Fund will be required to report on their own annual tax return their share of the Fund’s taxable income or loss. A Schedule K-1.</p>\n<p>Investors should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the tax consequences of investing in the Funds.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong><br>\nRedemptions may be requested by using TAP, with same business day processing done before the 2:00pm ET cutoff, if there is available liquidity in the Funds. Otherwise, redemptions are expected to be processed the following business day. Redemptions may be done in USDC or USD.</p>\n<p><strong>10.

Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong><br>\nThe underlying assets are U.S. Treasury Bills, the most liquid asset in financial markets. Treasury Bills are also considered the safest and most stable asset class in the market. The short duration of the assets also minimizes interest rate risk.</p>\n<p>The Funds are often able to settle redemptions as quickly as the same day, though that depends on timing as well as the conversion and transfer speed of service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>12. If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong><br>\nThe minting and redemption process is fully automated by smart contracts.

A reverse repo refers to the seller side of a repurchase agreement (RRP), or repo. At present moment, iSDYF’s portfolio is made up 100% of RRPs. Reverse repo is largely considered the safest way to keep cash in traditional finance, more safe than direct purchase of treasury bills.</p>\n<p>iSDYF may also purchase short-dated U.S. Treasury securities. iSDYF may also hold stablecoins or cash for liquidity management.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum/Maximum transaction size</strong></p>\n<p>Hashnote can exit or enter a position with billions of dollars without incurring slippage costs.

Hashnote’s principals are professionals with a combined 50+ years in traditional finance/banking, options trading, software engineering, and blockchain technology at global trading and investment companies. Hashnote’s team has been an active participant and pioneer in the institutional digital asset markets. Our mission is to build what finance will look like in ten years.</p>\n<p>We adhere to strict regulations set by the CFTC and CIMA, ensuring our operations meet institutional investment standards. Assets are protected through segregated custodial accounts at BNY Mellon. This straightforward and secure approach gives investors the confidence to focus on their investment goals. Trust and transparency are the pillars of our service, making us a dependable partner for the Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>USYC has been designed to be a money-market-like product for capital efficiency and trading. Not only is it a fully compliant token governed under strict regulatory regimes, and available globally, it will be available widely in centralized finance in digital assets. As Arbitrum looks to position itself as the hub on onchain DeFi, housing USYC as a flagship asset only adds value to the ecosystem. USYC will be used in the onchain and offchain financial ecosystem alike. Engaging USYC is a staple of an onchain DeFi ecosystem competitive with traditional finance as Arbitrum looks to become.</p>\n<p>The stated goal of the STEP program is for the DAO to diversify its treasury and deploy into assets that are uncorrelated with the broader digital asset ecosystem. Hashnote believes in fully tokenized products being composable with the broader DeFi ecosystem which we are committed to doing with Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Hashnote plans to launch additional products in the coming months with different underlying investment strategies and asset classes that benefit from the advantages. Our team has deep experience in traditional finance, and is committed to bringing more RWAs and investment strategies to the ecosystem, ensuring Arbitrum One is a top destination for tokenized assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>STBT is able to be bridged between Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum One through its integration with Chainlink CCIP. By allocating part of STEP to STBT, the amount can be kept on Arbitrum chain’s TVL. It also serves as an excellent example of RWA tokens that are secured on Ethereum mainnet through minting and redeeming, but interoperable with Arbitrum to have greater transactional efficiency with cheaper gas.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the inclusion of STBT can expand the user reach of Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem to a larger audience, especially in the Asia Pacific region where Matrixdock has a strong presence and is well-connected to institutional clients. This will also demonstrate the composability of T-bill tokens on Arbitrum, where more protocols will be encouraged to incorporate yield-generating RWA tokens as part of their strategies or underlying collateral for DeFi operations.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Identify key management personnel and individual experience. Also include third parties utilized for managing assets and their qualifications.</strong></p>\n<p>Eva Meng, Head of RWA</p>\n<p>As Head of RWA, Eva oversees Matrixdock, an RWA tokenization brand owned by Matrixport. Eva is passionate about bridging digital assets and traditional finance and is focused on leading the team to build cutting-edge technology in the tokenization space. Prior to Matrixport, Eva spent over 6 years in the digital asset mining industry.</p>\n<p>Rohit Apte, Head of Trading</p>\n<p>As Head of Trading, Rohit leads the trade desk with focus on Matrixport’s tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills (T-Bills) offering – the Short-term Treasury Bill Token (STBT). Rohit has over 18 years of experience in trading across traditional and cryptocurrency markets. Prior to venturing into crypto, Rohit was co-head of trade desk at HSBC.</p>\n<p>Kyle Wang, Technical Lead</p>\n<p>Dr. Wang leads Matrixport’s Blockchain research, bringing extensive experience in blockchain development. He also acts as the lead developer for SmartBCH, a sidechain of Bitcoin Cash. He held key roles at Bitmain (2016-2019) and CoinEx Chain (2019-2020). He got a Ph.D. degree in Computer Architecture from Peking University in 2009.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe any previous work by the entity or its officers/key contributors similar to that requested. References are encouraged.</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock is a digital asset platform that provides access to Real World Assets (RWA) through tokenization. It is a brand fully owned by Matrixport, an all-in-one crypto financial service platform that offers custody, asset management, brokerage and RWA tokenization services. Matrixport currently custodies and manages approximately USD 4 billion of crypto assets. Its client base includes more than 5000+ miners, high-networth individuals, family offices, hedge funds, ventures, protocols and foundations across Asia, Europe, Australia and offshore countries. With its vast product portfolio and geographic reach, Matrixport can help bootstrap the adoption of STBT by providing support including custody, DeFi asset management products with respect to STBT, trading liquidity and lending etc.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Has your entity or its officers/key contributors been subject to an enforcement action, criminal action, or defaulted on legal or financial obligations? Please describe the circumstances if so.</strong></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Describe any conflicts of interest for your entity and key personnel.</strong></p>\n<p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Insurance coverages, guarantees, and backstops</strong></p>\n<p>STBT currently does not have any additional insurance coverage. However, our stringent choice of trusted custodians ensures that client securities are segregated, and cannot be commingled by law. Additionally, our bankruptcy remoteness structure provides a strong safeguard of funds in the unlikely event of incidents.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Historical tracking error in your proposed product, or similar to that being proposed product</strong></p>\n<p>There is no historical tracking error between STBT and the underlying assets, as the increase in NAV is directly reflected in the increase in total STBT supply during business days. STBT is crypto-native and distributes yield during non-business days using an automated formula. The STBT supply is reconciled with the NAV of underlying assets on the next business day, ensuring the accuracy of yield.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Brief reason for above tracking error</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable</p>\n<p><strong>9. Please describe any experience your firm has in working with decentralized organizational structures</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock has strong involvement in the DeFi ecosystem, and some dApps that we work with have a DAO structure such as T-protocol. We are continuously engaging with partners, many of which are in various stages of decentralization. Additionally, our Transparency Panel consists of several key industry players, some of whom had past and current experiences working in DAO structures.</p>\n<p><strong>10.

Please describe your proposed product, including a description of the underlying assets and, if more than one asset, the proposed allocation among assets and general investment guidelines. Where appropriate, include targeted maturity mix and credit quality. Attach supplementary documents as appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>Short-term Treasury Bill Token (STBT) is designed for accredited investors seeking US treasury yields with their stablecoin holdings. STBT currently yields approximately 4.8-4.9% APY on average (as of Apr 2024). Each STBT is pegged to 1 USD and backed by US treasury securities with maturities within 6 months, reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by US treasury securities and cash not exceeding 5% of NAV.</p>\n<p>T-bills will be bought with the highest yield in tranches, laddering maturity dates such that there will be access to potential liquidity to support any redemptions without selling any T-bills.</p>\n<p>Matrixdock will distribute yield daily through the rebase of STBT in holders token balances. The total STBT supply is equivalent to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying asset portfolio, which equates to the sum of the market value of US T-bills, Repos (overnight loans fully-backed by T-bills) and cash.</p>\n<p><strong>Do investors have any shareholder, investor, creditor or similar rights?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.

Given that the STBT entities are special purpose vehicles that only conduct the STBT program, these entities incur no liabilities other than those obligations toward the STBT token holders, which are the only obligations of the STBT entities. As described above, the number of STBT tokens issued will always be less than the dollar value of the underlying reserves held by the STBT entities. With these factors combined, the STBT entities are bankruptcy remote. Details of the entities can be shared via email.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the Issuer issue more than one asset?

If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>STBT mitigates contract and operational risks through the implementation of a whitelist mechanism, time-lock contracts, and an independent real-time monitoring system, ensuring the highest level of safety and security.</p>\n<p>In order to further prevent operational and hacking risks, Matrixdock has implemented two separated sets of monitoring systems:</p>\n<p>A. The first system monitors the difference between the business order data and the contract activity data to detect any unauthorized minting of STBT tokens. Any suspicious activity can be immediately canceled, and emergency plans activated.</p>\n<p>B. The second system monitors the difference between the confirmation fiat wiring amount and the contract activity data. This monitoring service is independently maintained and monitored to identify any anomaly.</p>\n<p>The STBT minter contract only allows whitelisted wallets to call this contract directly and mint/redeem STBT. In this way, all key actions initiated through the minter contract, such as Mint, Burn, Settle, will be transparently tracked on-chain, ensuring full transparency and allowing for the tracking of all capital flows and information related to the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Does the product rely on any derivative product (swaps, OTC agreements)?</strong></p>\n<p>No, STBT does not rely on any derivative products.</p>\n<p><strong>8. List all the third party counterparties linked to your assets including and not restricted to prime broker if any, custodian, reporting agent, banks for derivatives or loans and provide primary contact details for the third party counterparties</strong></p>\n<p>Please refer to the email.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>Matrixdock team strictly adheres to standard operating procedures (SOPs) for daily operations and ensures that the net asset value (NAV) of underlying assets is always no less than the total supply of STBT. These reports are uploaded on-chain daily, which allows for complete transparency and minimizes operational risks. The STBT contract has included Chainlink PoR verification logic to ensure STBT underlying reserve is greater than or equal to the total supply at all time.(<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xad4A9bED9a5E2c1c9a6E43D35Db53c83873dd901#readContract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chainlink Onchain Verification</a> )</p>\n<p>STBT is issued under an orphan SPV structure commonly adopted in asset-backed securities issuance by traditional financial organizations, which has the highest degree of credit enhancement. In this legal set-up, Matrixdock plays the role of a service provider and Matrixdock counterparty risk is fully removed because both the token issuance/redemption and the underlying asset management are conducted from this Orphan SPV which itself is a bankruptcy-remote trust.</p>\n<p>Operationally, the STBT minter contract provides enhanced transparency DeFi ecosystem partners where all key actions initiated through the minter contract, such as Mint, Burn, Settle, will be transparently tracked on-chain, ensuring full transparency and allowing for the tracking of all capital flows and information related to the transactions.

Are the RWA tokens being used in any other protocols? Please describe the various components of the ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>STBT has been used in various DeFi protocols in several functions, including being the underlying assets for stablecoins, yield-generating products and collateral for loans.</p>\n<p>At Verified USD foundation, USDV stablecoin is minted using STBT as the underlying RWA token, providing yield to ecosystem participants. At T-Protocol and Term Finance, STBT has also been used in collateralized loans, enabling capital efficiency through its strong composability with lending platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How are trusted roles/admins managed in the system? Which aspects of the solution require trust from users?</strong></p>\n<p>The permission framework of the STBT contract is broadly classified into three distinct roles: ControllerRole, IssuerRole, ModeratorRole. The proposal is to designate a single smart contract with a timelock function as the controller contract for all three roles. All STBT administrator activities are carried out via this controller contract, with each operation subject to two stages of proposing and executing, and the execution must conform to the delay specified by the timelock. The overall structure is as follows:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1a97c86bf83b32575e9d59c095ab122f9f5779e8.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3NfBFzEv0NkcyzGcJuIL3CbJD6g.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a97c86bf83b32575e9d59c095ab122f9f5779e8_2_465x219.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"3NfBFzEv0NkcyzGcJuIL3CbJD6g\" width=\"465\" height=\"219\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a97c86bf83b32575e9d59c095ab122f9f5779e8_2_465x219.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a97c86bf83b32575e9d59c095ab122f9f5779e8_2_697x328.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1a97c86bf83b32575e9d59c095ab122f9f5779e8_2_930x438.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"DDE5EE\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Timelock contract: There is a single external control smart contract with a timelock function as the controller contract, through which all STBT administrator activities are carried out. Each operation must go through two stages of proposing and executing, with execution conforming to the 4-hour delay specified by the timelock.</p>\n<p>The timelock contract is the only admin, and the security of the STBT contract is normalized to the security of each role involved in the timelock controller: proposer, executor, and canceller. The canceller is one self-hosted hardware wallet that is authorized to cancel an operation scheduled during the timelock period by calling the timelock controller.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there any custom logic required for your RWA token? If so please give any details.</strong></p>\n<p>ERC1400 standard is split into several modular sub-standards：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>ERC1410 defines partially fungible tokens where balances of tokens can have an associated metadata</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ERC1594 defines transfer restrictions and core security token functionality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ERC1643 defines document management functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ERC1644 defines controller operation functionality</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular, the STBT token contract implements the ERC1594 transfer restrictions specs, and the ERC1644 controller operations specs. STBT utilizes the whitelist mechanism to determine whether transmission and reception of addresses are authorized.</p>\n<p><strong>Supplementary</strong></p>\n<p>Transparency Panel of STBT is the first in the industry to leverage on recognized third-party independent oversight to enhance greater transparency. The panel consists of reputable members from Verified USD Foundation, LayerZero Labs and Curve Finance. Panel members provide third-party verification of off-chain assets through direct view-only access of STBT’s bank and broker accounts. Monthly updates are published on the STBT website transparency page.</p>\n<p>Should STBT be a successful inclusion to STEP, it would be possible for an appointed member of Arbitrum DAO or STEP’s program manager to potentially join the Transparency Panel.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/matrixdock-stbt-step-application/23584\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/matrixdock-stbt-step-application/23584","pubDate":"Thu, 02 May 2024 02:09:08 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23584"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/matrixdock-stbt-step-application/23584.rss","#text":"Matrixdock STBT - STEP Application"},"filter":false},{"title":"Revest (Resonate) STEP Application","dc:creator":"Scooter","category":"STEP Applications","description":"<p>Questionnaire - May 1st.

What would we change with oARB if Dolomite is granted STIP.B?<br>\nThe primary complaint we heard from users with significant capital deposited was that completing tasks from the XP program is not feasible from such high-value wallets. In exchange for the capital they’re providing, they really wanted Dolomite to implement a threshold number (like $100,000+ in net equity across their deposits/positions) that allows them to receive the 3.75% preferential discount per week. This way we can still encourage high net worth users to participate who, for various reasons, feel like they cannot utilize the XP program. We’ll explore this for STIP.B if we’re able to receive an extension.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-7\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h3>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<p>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?<br>\nWe are requesting 500k $ARB for incentives</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

We hope to see a more streamlined submission process for mature projects that doesn’t detract from builders focused on building. We feel like mature projects that have a track record don’t need the same level of scrutiny as a new project that hasn’t launched yet (for example).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"special-notes-impact-of-using-oarb-during-stip-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#special-notes-impact-of-using-oarb-during-stip-8\"></a>Special Notes - Impact of Using oARB during STIP</h3>\n<p>Choosing to create a novel distribution mechanism for the ARB that the Arbitrum DAO allocated to Dolomite was the best decision we could have made. While oARB was initially met with friction, the adjustments we made to allow for a longer vesting in exchange for free oARB conversion was met with significant usage, TVL growth, and positive sentiment. We even mixed in our <a href=\"https://docs.dolomite.io/community-xp\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">XP Program</a> into oARB vesting, enabling level 4+ users to accelerate their vesting to 3.75% discount per week instead of 2.5%</p>\n<p>At the end of STIP, we had 1,785 long-term oARB vesters who have 723,004 ARB locked up with oARB for vesting, which matures between May 22, 2024 and December 31, 2024 (depending on when they began vesting and if they achieved level 4+). Due to their lingering oARB vesting positions, they established a relationship with Dolomite that will bring them back to the dapp continuously for months to come.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO should be extremely pleased with the results of the oARB distribution mechanic. Dolomite successfully warded off predatory value extractors, was able to lock up almost 75% of the ARB that was granted to Dolomite for months beyond the end of STIP, and even created a sink for the paired ARB that is coupled with each oARB vesting position. This sink and time-based vesting process has resulted in more <em>distributed</em> ARB sell pressure (as opposed to concentrated sell pressure) and more users that are committed to Arbitrum over the long term.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, if you dig into the profile of each long term oARB vester, you’ll notice a few strategies that were executed for this pairing process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Borrow the ARB for oARB pairing on Dolomite. This was a particularly smooth UX flow, since users were able to tap into Dolomite’s virtual liquidity for this borrowing process (paired ARB is sourced from user’s Dolomite Balances). It spurred additional borrowing activity for Dolomite which led to more transactions, sequencer revenue, and fee accrual for Dolomite and the Arbitrum DAO.</li>\n<li>Acquire ARB for oARB pairing across the various DEXs in the Arbitrum ecosystem. The realization for many that Arbitrum was going through a renaissance of activity led some to acquire a long term position in ARB, and they didn’t mind locking it up in an oARB vest for months.</li>\n<li>Withdraw ARB for oARB pairing from CEXs. We noticed various users would withdraw ARB from CEXs like Binance to their wallet and then would deposit this ARB on Dolomite to initiate the pairing process. This user journey was especially exciting to see unfold, because it brought activity back on chain that was otherwise lost to Binance being used as a place to custody the users’ assets.</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dolomite-stip-addendum/23582\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dolomite-stip-addendum/23582","pubDate":"Thu, 02 May 2024 02:00:32 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23582"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dolomite-stip-addendum/23582.rss","#text":"Dolomite STIP Addendum"},"filter":false},{"title":"Stakeup $STTBY STEP Application","dc:creator":"blarthy","category":"STEP Applications","description":"<p><strong>Applicant information</strong></p>\n<p>Name: <strong>StakeUp Protocol</strong></p>\n<p>Address (Headquarters):</p>\n<p>Oceania Business Plaza, Tower 1000,</p>\n<p>21st Floor, Isaac Hanono Missri Street,</p>\n<p>Punta Pacifica, Panama City, Republic of Panama</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation\">https://twitter.com/StakeUpProtocol</a></p>\n<p>Primary contact Name: Arthur Wiseberg</p>\n<p>Title: Co-Founder/Head of Growth</p>\n<p>Country: Portugal</p>\n<p>Email, Telegram, Forum, &amp; other methods of contact: <a href=\"mailto:arthur@blueberry.garden\">arthur@blueberry.garden</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation\">https://t.me/arthywise</a></p>\n<p>Key Information</p>\n<p>Expected Yield: 5.30%</p>\n<p>Expected Maturity: TBY 6 month - stTBY liquid asset 1:1 redeemable for USDC</p>\n<p>Underlying asset: IB01 &amp; USDC (IB01 are tokenized iShares Treasury Bond 0-1 yr UCITS ETF)</p>\n<p>Minimum/Maximum transaction size: $100 - No Max</p>\n<p>Current AUM for product: $2.2M</p>\n<p>Current AUM for issuer: $30M</p>\n<p>Volume of transactions LTM:</p>\n<p>Source of first-loss capital: N/a</p>\n<p><strong>Basics and background</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>This investment takes advantage of an innovative structure that utilizes decentralized commercial lending and borrowing to facilitate cross-border scaling of stTBY, into and beyond DeFi protocols.

We propose the inclusion of StakeUp’s stTBY, a stable asset backed by corporate debt overcollateralized by US Treasury Bills (T-Bills)–a scalable asset.</p>\n<p>Below I will describe why TBY and stTBY products are a suitable fit for DeFi and Arbitrums vision for STEP framework and could potentially offer a lower-risk profile compared to other stablecoins and on-chain US T-bills:</p>\n<p><strong>What is a TBY?</strong></p>\n<p>TBY, or Term Bound Yield, is a token issued by the Bloom protocol. It represents a fixed-income loan asset that is freely transferable and operates entirely on-chain. TBYs are designed to produce yields comparable to a 6-month U.S. Treasury Bill. They are unique because they offer accessibility to DeFi markets (permissionless) while maintaining a yield close or the same to traditional financial benchmarks. The yield is derived by commercial loan arrangements in which users lend USDC in a closed loop peer-to-pool model to a KYC borrower that is 102% overcollateralized with tokenized US treasuries. All collateral is held verifiably on-chain and debt is always repaid before the borrower realizes any return. Therefore, the TBYs have a similar economic risk profile to the underlying collateral.</p>\n<p><strong>Supporting Docs</strong><br>\nBloom: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation\">https://docs.bloom.garden/</a><br>\nTBY: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation\">https://docsend.com/view/ywukpt8kbqpg5m76/d/3kc3thbyrx48ku3z</a><br>\n<strong>Product Details</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gW4KSgml7oEKBsyO4SCD5Xt6EPK.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.22.16\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28_2_690x191.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.22.16\" data-base62-sha1=\"gW4KSgml7oEKBsyO4SCD5Xt6EPK\" width=\"690\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28_2_690x191.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28_2_1035x286.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/76b36c97407fd95d8c4400d1d4b6214138860d28.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"ACACAC\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b4e9e690793f32dab9cfb2ff7244d7f94cd30c2d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pOr4CmgOqEaU6JHC3z0wA6dxn7n.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.23.18\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b4e9e690793f32dab9cfb2ff7244d7f94cd30c2d.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.23.18\" data-base62-sha1=\"pOr4CmgOqEaU6JHC3z0wA6dxn7n\" width=\"690\" height=\"148\" data-dominant-color=\"A8A8A8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>The Underlying</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8a48e00c2ecd0f15cd2f719c4be3762800120363.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/jJk1zcL2xkTkB5ulB7PKr58S35N.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.24.00\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8a48e00c2ecd0f15cd2f719c4be3762800120363.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 02.24.00\" data-base62-sha1=\"jJk1zcL2xkTkB5ulB7PKr58S35N\" width=\"690\" height=\"152\" data-dominant-color=\"B0B0B0\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>What is stTBY?</strong></p>\n<p>Staked TBY (stTBY) is a liquid yield vault for USDC, or a USDC LST, offered by the StakeUp protocol, and is pegged 1:1 to USDC.

Any blacklisting/whitelisting features?</strong></p>\n<p>Bloom doesn’t issue or tokenize Treasuries. Instead, it operates as a protocol enabling individuals to lend to a pool. Eligible whitelisted parties (excluding USA and other restricted juristications) can then borrow from this pool and acquire treasury tokens from a whitelisted marketmaker that has treasury tokens from Backed within the same transaction, while debt and treasury tokens are locked in a smart contract to reduce counterparty risk.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Arbitrum is seeking to diversify its treasury into stable, liquid and yield earning assets. Chateau’s Reverse Repo product (CRR.D) checks all of these boxes by providing a 5.24% yield and offering T+0 redemption. Furthermore, CRR.D has a minimum investment size of $1, and is freely tradable and composable once minted.</p>\n<p>CRR.D is a debt product launched by the Chateau Capital team, an Arbitrum-native RWA platform that seeks to bring institutional-grade debt and equity instruments on-chain. We focus heavily on compliance and DeFi composability, to ensure that we are building a platform that is in line with Arbitrum’s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We are working directly with Hashnote which is a leader in the institutional DeFi space, with over 50 years of TradFi experience and tens of millions of $ in AUM. By bringing this product to the Arbitrum ecosystem, we also open the door for a deeper relationship between Hashnote and Arbitrum (currently they are focused on mainnet).</p>\n<p>There’s also 2 key aspects that we believe are worth emphasizing:</p>\n<p><strong>(i) Chateau is an Arbitrum-first platform.</strong> Unlike other projects that have chosen to prioritize other blockchains, the Chateau team is unapologetically focused on Arbitrum DeFi. Choosing Chateau as a service provider would send a strong signal to teams as to why they should focus on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>(ii) Chateau has a wider range of products than any other service providers.</strong> To truly drive more TVL via RWAs, Arbitrum must eventually expand beyond basic debt products. We have already launched Chateau Alternative Debt (CHAD.D) in partnership with Wall Street firm Covenant Venture Capital BVI. The product has a preferred return of 15% (averaging 18-21% since 2011) with no principal drawdown.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we will soon be launching private equity products including: OpenAI, Anthropic, MenloMicro, etc. We believe these RWA equity products will unlock massive demand that the current set of debt products cannot drive.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

How are Arbitrum’s assets protected vis-a-vis the bankruptcy of the brokerage or applicable financial institution (e.g., bank deposit insurance, securities insurance, etc.)?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(i) Segregated Accounts:</strong></p>\n<p>Hashnote ensures that all assets invested in the USYC product are held in segregated accounts. This means that Arbitrum’s assets are kept separate from the assets of Hashnote and other investors, thereby safeguarding your investment in the event of a bankruptcy of the brokerage or financial institution.</p>\n<p><strong>(ii) Custodial Arrangements:</strong></p>\n<p>Hashnote partners with highly reputable custodians, such as BNY Mellon, to manage the custody of the assets. Additionally, Komainu provides custody support for USYC, offering elevated capital efficiency for institutions. These institutions are well-regulated and adhere to stringent financial standards, further reducing the risk of financial failure.</p>\n<p>Custodial Oversight: The custodians are subject to regular audits and regulatory oversight, ensuring that they maintain high levels of financial health and operational integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>6.

Describe anticipated tax consequences (if any) in transacting on the underlying and/or receipt of yield.</strong></p>\n<p>The exact tax consequences depend on the tax jurisdiction of Arbitrum DAO and the legal entity making this investment</p>\n<p>When transacting in Hashnote’s USYC product and receiving yield, the anticipated tax consequences are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong>: If USYC tokens are sold at a profit, the gain may be subject to capital gains tax. The tax rate depends on the holding period: gains on tokens held for less than a year are taxed as short-term gains at ordinary income rates, while those held for longer are taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates, which range from 0% to 20% depending on your income.</p>\n<p><strong>Income from Yield:</strong> The yield generated from USYC, derived from investments in U.S. Treasury Bills and repo agreements, is treated as interest income, which is taxable at the federal level as ordinary income. However, interest from U.S. Treasury Bills is exempt from state and local taxes.</p>\n<p>Hashnote will generate the necessary tax forms for Arbitrum at the end of the year.</p>\n<p><strong>9.

As with any direct to consumer grants program, a number of factors can affect the results of the applied incentives. Guided by our KPIs and the overarching KPIs, we modified the allocation of the STIP rewards almost each epoch.</p>\n<p>The STIP program coincided with the launch of Perennial’s V2. This offered an opportunity to see its new mechanism in action. We saw makers take advantage of native leverage over the length of the program with Total Available Liquidity peaking at a multiple of 4.9x the TVL in the protocol. This efficiency is key to providing traders the best liquidity to trade with &amp; offer sophisticated makers greater capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>We found that applying incentives on newer markets helped de-risk them for makers and allowed us to experiment with new payoffs and price feeds. We’ll aim to continue this approach in the STIP bridge as it helps bring diversity to the Arbitrum perps landscape. Another learning was that OI rewards are a fickle tool that can attract mercenary capital. We experimented for two weeks and then removed them in favor of more sustainable mechanisms or subsidies.</p>\n<p>A key outcome was de-risking the unique protocol design of Perennial V2 to building inside and outside the ecosystem. We aimed to bring dev teams to Arbitrum and the STIP has helped us secure a number of key partnerships with teams like Kwenta (Optimism).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-7\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: In parallel to this STIP Bridge proposal, Perennial has a stand alone proposal to the DAO with Kwenta to build an incentives package to best support their launch on Arbitrum.
