The change only involves a modification of an existing configuration parameter and does not introduce any new functionality.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-overview-2\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has a governance process whereby the community can vote on proposals fully on-chain. Two distinct kinds of proposals can be passed: those that spend funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s ETH treasury and those that perform upgrades to the contracts governing the system. In either case, there is currently a 3-day delay between the time a proposal has passed and when it is executed. While the same delay applies for both types of proposal, the former is governed by the L2 Treasury Time Lock while the latter is governed by the L2 Core Time Lock. As such, the delays for each proposal type are independent and any changes made to one will not necessarily impact the other.</p>\n<p>While these delays are in place, the Security Council can always step in to stop malicious proposals. However, the delay gives the Security Council the time to act in the event that a malicious proposal is indeed passed. In addition, it provides users the opportunity to withdraw their assets in the event that they are dissatisfied with the changes that would result from a proposal. The proposal would increase the delay applied to the L2 Core Time Lock from 3 days to 8 days. All proposals regarding spending funds from the ArbitrumDAO ETH treasury would still maintain a delay of 3 days. Only constitutional proposals related to smart contract upgrades would be affected.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The primary motivation for this change is to increase the aforementioned security benefits. Namely, an increased delay will give the Security Council more time to review and stop malicious proposals (which is already a technical and lengthy process), while also providing users more time to make an informed decision. Furthermore, the proposal mentions a <a href=\"https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">framework developed by L2BEAT</a> as part of the motivation behind it. More specifically, it will change the color of <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum’s ‘Exit Window’ slice</a> on <a href=\"https://gov.l2beat.com/t/the-risk-rosette-framework/292\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2BEAT’s Risk Rosette</a> from red to yellow.</p>\n<p>By only increasing the delay on the L2 Core Time Lock, a compromise is achieved between security and speed. Since constitutional proposals are much more complex in nature, the Security Council requires more time to review these proposals than those directed towards the treasury. This timelock delay increase would provide the necessary time to review these potentially complex proposals while the traditional proposals regarding treasury spending adhere to the existing process. The downside of increasing this delay is that constitutional proposals will now take an extra 5 days to execute. No additional costs or security risks are introduced to the system as the proposed changes only modify one configuration parameter.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-technical-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-technical-details-4\"></a>Technical Details</h3>\n<p>No new functionality needs to be introduced for this change. The value of the existing <code>_minDelay</code> parameter would be changed from 259200 to 691200 in the <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0#readProxyContract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2 Timelock</a> contract. Note that the units of this parameter are in seconds, so the change is from 3 days to 8 days as explained earlier. The <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">action contract</a> has already been implemented and is pending an audit. It consists of a <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306/files#diff-aa7423831f93d30e4ebfa2052f0b1e3a90b2d90cd1e76ee2d074d47c6b17a82c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">contract</a> that has a function called <code>perform</code> which:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Calls the <code>L2AddressRegistry</code> contract deployed on Arbitrum at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x56C4E9Eb6c63aCDD19AeC2b1a00e4f0d7aBda9d3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x56C4E9Eb6c63aCDD19AeC2b1a00e4f0d7aBda9d3</a> to get the value of the <code>coreGovTimelock</code> state variable. Currently, the value of this variable is the address of the contract deployed at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0</a>.</li>\n<li>Calls the <code>updateDelay()</code> function of the stored <code>coreGovTimelock</code> contract with the new value of <code>86400 * 8</code>. Note that 86400 is 24 hours in seconds, so this would effectively update the delay to 8 days as described. This function, in turn, sets the <code>_arbMinDelay</code> to this new value and emits an event. No other changes occur.\n<ul>\n<li>Using the same <code>coreGovTimelock</code> contract, the <code>getMinDelay()</code> function is called to ensure that the new value of <code>_arbMinDelay</code> reflects the proposed change.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Calls the <code>L2Registry</code> contract once again, this time retrieving the value of the <code>arbitrumDAOConstitution</code> state variable. Currently, the value of this variable is the address of the contract deployed at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1D62fFeB72e4c360CcBbacf7c965153b00260417\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x1D62fFeB72e4c360CcBbacf7c965153b00260417</a>.</li>\n<li>Calls the <code>setConstitutionHash</code> function with the new value of <code>0x28faf2acba9b3ff80ec484e3d5646931eeef40568b1b7c38dbe52b890bfd7938</code>. This reflects the changes made to the constitution text which are discussed further below. This function, in turn, sets the <code>constitutionHash</code> state variable and emits an event. No other changes occur.\n<ul>\n<li>Using the same <code>arbitrumDAOConstitution</code> contract, the <code>constitutionHash()</code> getter for this state variable is called to ensure that the new value of <code>constitutionHash</code> reflects this change.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <code>CoreGovTimelockUpdateDelayEightDayAction</code> contract already seems to have been deployed on the Arbitrum network at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5B947D8bF197467be7ef381b7cAfEE0A7B35737A#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x5B947D8bF197467be7ef381b7cAfEE0A7B35737A</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">current constitution</a> of the Arbitrum DAO has been modified with the following changes:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"diff\"><code class=\"lang-diff\">- Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, a 3 day waiting period occurs. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.\n+ Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 or 8 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, there is a 3 day waiting period for actions related to the DAO Treasury and an 8 day waiting period for an L2-to-L1 Message. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.\n\n- Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the 3 day waiting period in Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.\n+ Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the waiting period for Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.\n</code></pre>\n<p>A <code>keccak256</code> hash of the full constitution text was used to generate the value mentioned above. Based on independent review from the ARDC, these changes have been verified to produce the same hash as mentioned by the team. This can be verified by following the same <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#constitution-hash\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">instructions for generating the hash</a> as outlined by the team, with the new changes to the constitution reflected. Note that the <code>CoreGovTimelockUpdateDelayEightDayAction</code> contract has not been directly audited and any calls are not guaranteed to succeed. However, the functionality would only execute if the changes are successfully performed. In addition, no other changes are proposed beyond those explicitly mentioned in the proposal.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We found the timelock delay increase proposal to be a reasonable compromise between increased security and maintaining the existing benefits of speedy treasury proposals. This will enable Arbitrum to transition into a more mature rollup that operates independently of any centralized actors, as outlined by the L2BEAT framework. Moreover, the proposal provides added security to reduce the possibility of malicious contract upgrades being executed, while also increasing the amount of time a user has to act on a proposal. The changes described in the proposal have been verified and exactly match those that are currently pending execution on-chain.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-l2-time-lock-delay-proposal-security-review/26837\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-l2-time-lock-delay-proposal-security-review/26837","pubDate":"Wed, 18 Sep 2024 10:11:54 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26837"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-l2-time-lock-delay-proposal-security-review/26837.rss","#text":"Arbitrum L2 Time Lock Delay Proposal Security Review"},"filter":false},{"title":"Zeroknowledge - Candidate for Security Council Elections 2024","dc:creator":"zeroknowledge","category":"General","description":"<p>I bring over 20 years of deep experience in security and cryptography, having worked as both a researcher and consultant.

There are no issues with the proposed design at this time.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58861-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58861-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Financial markets reward first actors. Because Arbitrum’s Sequencer is “first come, first serve” and fully open, anyone that sees an opportunity to make a profit can send a transaction to realize the gain. The trouble is that a lot of these opportunities become visible to the entire market at the same time, incentivizing all market actors to send a transaction to the network in the hope that they’re first. The first motivation for this AIP is to address <a href=\"https://status.arbitrum.io/clq6te1l142387b8n5bmllk9es\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">spikes in network traffic that have caused the Sequencer to go down in the past</a>. This AIP works toward smoothing out the spikes by removing the incentive for <em>everyone</em> to send transactions to the market. It removes this incentive by creating an auction for the right to jump the transaction line for a period of time (one minute is suggested). If someone has the right to jump in front of you, there’s no incentive to race to be first. This ties into a second described motivation for the AIP: by auctioning this right, the DAO can be compensated for providing these financial opportunities in the first place. The auction and it’s surrounding infrastructure is being designed by Offchain Labs and Espresso Systems and is called “Timeboost.”</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58861-review-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58861-review-2\"></a>Review</h2>\n<p>This AIP is in it’s theoretical phase. There is no code or decentralized version today, but community approval would grant Offchain Labs and Espresso Systems the runway to develop those things. Those details are where most of our security concerns will be so we look forward to reviewing their work when it’s available. The auction mechanics are sound and use well-understood methods. The roles in the system and their responsibilities are well separated and as simple as can be. We have no security concerns about the centralized version of Timeboost as it is described in this AIP.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/timeboost-security-analysis/26832\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/timeboost-security-analysis/26832","pubDate":"Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:19:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26832"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/timeboost-security-analysis/26832.rss","#text":"Timeboost Security Analysis"},"filter":false},{"title":"17 September 2024 - Start of Security Council Elections(!) & Roundup of Active/Upcoming Votes","dc:creator":"raam","category":"Weekly Voting Reminders","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-58812-security-council-election-reminder-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58812-security-council-election-reminder-1\"></a>Security Council Election Reminder <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/alarm_clock.png?v=12\" title=\":alarm_clock:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":alarm_clock:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/2\">Security Council Election Registrations are open (till Sept 22)</a></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Potential candidates have until September 22 to register for the Security Council elections (September 2024 cohort) on <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/2\">Tally</a></li>\n<li>The security council is a committee of 12 members who are signers of a multi-sig wallet, tasked with executing Emergency and Non-Emergency Actions to uphold the ArbitrumDAO’s Constitution</li>\n<li>Check out the resources below to find out more:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/security-council-elections-101/16314\">Security Council Elections 101 Forum Post</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/arbitrum/status/1830655551702712788\">X Thread</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-to-register-as-a-candidate/16364\">How to register as a Candidate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/security-council-members-duties-and-principles/16313\">Duties and principles of Security Council members</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58812-onchain-proposals-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58812-onchain-proposals-2\"></a>Onchain Proposals <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ballot_box.png?v=12\" title=\":ballot_box:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":ballot_box:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/104013508427929791254647754028304659752687979030673391997226897145800989991969\">Ethereum Protocol Attackathon Sponsorship</a> (Voting starts on Sept 20)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ethereum Foundation is seeking sponsorship from the ArbitrumDAO to support an “Attackathon,” a large-scale security audit event organized by the Ethereum Foundation and hosted on the Immunefi platform.

The ARB will be converted by the Arbitrum Foundation only when macroeconomic conditions improve and the total amount obtained is similar to or higher than the first iteration (which got $30 million). The goal of the STEP program is treasury diversification along with ecosystem growth for Real World Asset (RWA) protocols on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal kickstarts the next version of the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stable Treasury Endowment Program</a>, which aims to grow the RWA ecosystem (many of the top protocols do not need grants so much as AUM for their product) while simultaneously diversifying our treasury into stable, liquid and yield-generating assets (the volatility of the ARB token has highlighted the need for prudent diversification based on fixed targets).</p>\n<p>The RWA sector is currently $12 billion (it was $1 billion at the time of STEP 1), growing at leaps and bounds with much room to grow even further considering the US treasury market by itself is $20 trillion. To stay on top of this competitive sector, we need reliability and consistency in the programs we run for this vertical.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we have seen increasing interest in treasury diversification initiatives across Arbitrum DAO. We propose 3 clear principles to follow in dealing with service providers proposing to help with Arbitrum treasury diversification;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Directly own the process of selecting stable assets providing yield rather than delegating to a treasury manager (no point paying 1% AUM for them to hold low-risk assets on our behalf).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The STEP program is an example of how this can take place: an RFP under which projects apply with their product; a committee to review applicants; a program manager to monitor selected products</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Diversify the treasury in a manner that also promotes ecosystem growth, by conducting a competitive process where the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO selecting a providers asset is as valuable as the business they get from it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Accordingly, have projects directly apply in a competitive process on our forum if they want us to diversify into their product and be ratified in some way through a vote, not privately approach a treasury manager to get included</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Use fixed targets for conversion to obtain a better bang for our ARB and reject treasury managers proposing point-in-time diversification below the target</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We propose additional treasury diversification take place at a rate close to or higher than the first STEP program. Since we already have $30 million converted into stable RWAs, there is no urgency for more diversification at a significantly lower price.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>In mid-2024, Arbitrum DAO diversified $30 million into stable, liquid &amp; yield generating RWAs. A comprehensive RFP process was undertake, where the DAO received 33 applications from RWA issuers, of which 16 were shortlisted and 6 were finally selected for allocations: Securitize BUIDL ($9.57 million), Ondo USDY ($5.22 million), Superstate USTB ($5.22 million), Mountain USDM ($3.48 million), OpenEden TBill ($3.48 million), and Backed Finance bIB01 ($3.48 million). These allocations helped us diversify the treasury into dollar denominated assets, got selected providers to launch on Arbitrum and are expected to generate a yield of roughly $1-1.5 million per year for our treasury.</p>\n<p>While the 1st program narrowly targeted low-risk and liquid instruments (primarily US treasury bills and money market instruments), the second version will expand its scope to include products in private credit, equities, commodities and global bonds. We saw breakout interest from service providers with such products in the 1st version of STEP and had to turn down the majority of them due to a limited mandate. The dashboard at <a href=\"http://rwa.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">rwa.xyz</a> lists these categories as fast-growing and we should be at the forefront of nurturing such products.</p>\n<p>Overall, this proposal aims to achieve 3 broad objectives;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Show that Arbitrum has a plan for the RWA vertical and such projects should build on our chain, by expanding the STEP program to more categories than just U.S. treasuries</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Let the DAO directly own stable RWAs through a competitive selection process for providers, instead of paying 1% AUM to treasury managers for selecting and holding low risk assets on our behalf. Use yield from the products to cover operational expenses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provision funds ahead of time for optimal execution, so that the next STEP program is of a roughly similar value or higher than the last one ($30 million) at the same price tag, by waiting until the right macroeconomic conditions before liquidating the budgeted ARB</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will transfer 35 million ARB to the same foundation managed wallet (0xe41d54471EfA03eFF6365795f60545F3cAF7C97e) used in the initial STEP program</li>\n<li>The foundation will at their discretion either set limit orders for ARB or liquidate after average ARB price over the last month is close to or higher than the amount received for the initial STEP program</li>\n<li>The Arbitrum Foundation announces availability of funds on the forum after completion of orders, kickstarting the next phase of an RFP for RWA projects to apply under on the governance forum</li>\n<li>While funds are awaiting optimal execution or soon after, proposals are passed ratifying the RFP, committee composition for selection of providers, asset types, eligibility criteria for STEP 2 and other required details for running the program</li>\n<li>Funds are allocated to selected providers after ratification by the DAO</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></p>\n<p>The focus of this proposal is ensuring we have sufficient time to optimally convert and receive adequate funds for the next STEP program, along with laying out some general guidelines for treasury diversification into stable assets (no AUM % fees on stable assets, focus on ecosystem growth in diversification, do not diversify when macroeconomic conditions are poor).</p>\n<p>Concurrently, the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-ii-steering-committee/26074\">STEP steering committee</a> (not involved in this proposal) is putting forth its own implementation budget to complete its research on STEP such as types of assets, eligibility criteria, liquidation methods, selection procedures and more.

Studying the configuration of a social network and its impact on member retention could yield valuable insights to improve the resilience of Web3 communities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the social network mapping analysis gives us a potential tool to identify high-context community members (e.g. a recent analysis of Optimism’s community enabled their community team to <a href=\"https://medium.com/togethercrew/case-study-how-optimism-added-science-to-the-art-of-community-management-dfab84727a6c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">identify potential community ambassadors</a> who had been missed).

This bot has already been deployed in 100+ communities, including Optimism, Celo, Aave, Aragon, Shardeum, etc. <strong>The permissions are configured to be low-risk</strong> (no admin permission, no managing channels, etc. so even if the bot was hacked, the discord and discourse servers wouldn’t be compromised) and we have battle-tested for scalability and reliability.</p>\n<p>The analyses of the data are performed by the TogetherCrew team of scientists and our research partners at the University of California Santa Barbara. Those handling the data have undergone ethical data management training and could lose their academic credentials for unethical conduct.</p>\n<p>The architecture has been developed by our tech lead who’s ex-Accenture and built a data startup in the medical industry. So although the data we manage is low risk (no private data, only public handles, etc.) we’re still investing in data security progressively.</p>\n<p>We don’t use the data to train any AI models. Some analyses might use AI, in which case we favour open-source models that don’t feed on user data.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes to the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy:</strong><br>\nTogetherCrew currently has no changes planed, but should a change be planned, TogetherCrew will give a minimum of 2 weeks’ notice to the DAO, via a new proposal post, before such changes take effect.

Chaos Labs supports the proposal, viewing it as a safe upgrade, but we do highlight several minor economic risks.</p>\n<p>Despite these minor concerns, Chaos Labs’ find no major blockers to the proposal’s implementation from an economic perspective.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58637-description-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-description-1\"></a>Description</h1>\n<p>Timeboost is a proposed upgrade that would affect the way transactions are ordered in Arbitrum blocks. A summary of this proposal is included here for ease of reference.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-current-transaction-ordering-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-current-transaction-ordering-2\"></a>Current Transaction Ordering</h2>\n<p>Transactions on Arbitrum are currently ordered on a first-come, first-serve basis (FCFS) . There are no priority fees, meaning that the value created by time-sensitive transactions accrues to searchers and does not flow back to the DAO.</p>\n<p>First-come-first-serve transaction ordering has served Arbitrum chains well to date by allowing extremely fast block times. The default is 250ms, but this can go as low as 100ms, providing Orbit chains with the low latency needed for specialized gaming and DeFi applications.</p>\n<p>Harmful MEV such as frontrunning and sandwich attacks are prevented as there is no way to priortize any transaction earlier in a block.</p>\n<p>First-Come-First-Serve is also simple for teams to understand, implement and operate. This is a significant benefit to teams deploying Orbit chains using the Arbitrum tech stack.</p>\n<p>One consequence of FCFS transaction ordering is that it results in actors spamming the network when opportunities for MEV present themselves. Searchers submit multiple orders to capture MEV opportunities such as arbitrage and backrunning, in the hope that one of them is routed to the sequencer first.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-timeboost-transaction-ordering-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-timeboost-transaction-ordering-3\"></a>Timeboost Transaction Ordering</h2>\n<p>Timeboost improves on the current Arbitrum transaction ordering policy by creating an express lane, giving the auction winner’s transactions a time advantage for inclusion at the sequencer. This is implemented by introducing a latency for normal transactions defined by the NonExpressDelayMsec parameter, while the auction winner’s transactions will be sequenced and included immediately.</p>\n<p>This creates a market for prioritizing transactions, while keeping the transaction costs for regular transactions comparable to the first-come, first-served (FCFS) model. By introducing market-based pricing for priority transactions, time-sensitive transactions cost approximately their long-term value, boosting sequencer revenue without affecting the cost structure for the majority of transactions.</p>\n<p>Auction participants need to deposit funds (for making bids) into the auction contract ahead of time and bid for express lane control for the upcoming round, which lasts 60 seconds. The auction closes 15 seconds before the start of the next round.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that Timeboost increases latency slightly for non-express lane transactions, while express lane transactions latency remains the same as under FCFS. This means that the express lane owner has their transactions included amongst regular transactions submitted to the sequencer NonExpressDelayMsec milliseconds prior. The timing of inclusion of express lane transactions remains uncertain for this reason, but where previously unknown profitable opportunities emerge, the express lane owner will have a healthy advantage to capitalize on them.</p>\n<p>For more details on Timeboost, see the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167\">original post</a>, and follow-up FAQs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58637-economic-impacts-and-risks-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-economic-impacts-and-risks-4\"></a>Economic Impacts and Risks</h1>\n<p>Timeboost is extremely likely to achieve its stated objectives of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To allow the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.</li>\n<li>To offer the Arbitrum DAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The increased latency for non-express lane transactions will significantly reduce the incentive to submit multiple orders to capture MEV in most cases. Searchers should rationally assume that the express lane controller will use its latency advantage to capture most of these and not bother trying.</p>\n<p>At the same time, assuming at least two independent and competitive parties bid for the express lane, this latency advantage should be valued relative to the expected MEV opportunities in each round. This will increase revenues for the Arbitrum DAO without increasing the fees regular users pay, maximizing the potential for ecosystem growth in an economically sustainable way.</p>\n<p>While Chaos Labs generally views the Timeboost proposal as a positive step forward for Arbitrum chains and a safe upgrade to first-come, first-serve transaction ordering, we recommend monitoring for a number of potential second-order effects of this upgrade. It is not apparent exactly how the marketplace for the express lane will develop ex-ante. In this section, we highlight some possible ways this marketplace could develop and the associated risks.</p>\n<p>Should either of these or other unknown risks materialize, further iteration on Timeboost could be necessary in the future. The risks highlighted below are meant to serve as a preemptive set of second-order behaviors to monitor rather than any blockers to the rollout of Timeboost from an economic risk perspective.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-secondary-markets-for-the-express-lane-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-secondary-markets-for-the-express-lane-5\"></a>Secondary Markets for the Express Lane</h2>\n<p>A likely scenario is that secondary markets develop for access to the express lane where searchers compensate the express lane controller for access when they need it. Should this occur, the express lane becomes more valuable and therefore the auctions should clear at higher prices, increasing DAO revenue.</p>\n<p>The express lane controller should rationally allow anyone willing to pay access to the express lane, creating a market for priority access on demand. Chaos Labs does not view secondary markets as a negative outcome, but acknowledges that much remains unknown around how they could unfold.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-competition-in-the-express-lane-auction-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-competition-in-the-express-lane-auction-6\"></a>Competition in the Express Lane Auction</h2>\n<p>Independent competition is crucial for auctions to clear at efficient prices. The innovative and novel Timeboost ordering has no precedent currently and we therefore consider a range of potential market development outcomes for the express lane.</p>\n<p>There is a risk that a small group of participants could dominate the Timeboost auctions, potentially due to their superior ability to capitalize on MEV or through other advantages. This dominance could lead to reduced competition or even collusion, undermining the fairness and efficiency of the system.</p>\n<p>The dynamic reserve price mechanism acts as a defense against uncompetitive bidding scenarios. It is recommended to monitor the auction winners, their bids, and the MEV harvested over each round to ensure that the express lane does not become too profitable for auction winners.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-introducing-mev-strategies-not-currently-viable-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-introducing-mev-strategies-not-currently-viable-7\"></a>Introducing MEV strategies not currently viable</h2>\n<p>Ordinary transactions will remain private until executed under Timeboost, which typically prevents the express lane owner from front-running user transactions. However, transactions like liquidations and pre-committed orders, such as limit orders, are at risk of being front-run by the express lane auction winner.</p>\n<p>This occurs because the express lane owner has a latency advantage, allowing them to manage and execute these transactions with a higher likelihood of landing in their order of preference. While these same strategies are technically possible under FCFS, the probability of landing them is low enough to discourage them. It is unclear whether this will change under Timeboost to make these strategies more predictable.</p>\n<p>In this case, the owner of the express lane has the opportunity to capture value that is not currently available at the expense of liquidated (or limit order-placing) users and/or protocols. It should be noted that if this is the case then presumably the express lane will become more valuable, increasing DAO revenue.</p>\n<p>Example of potential Timeboost Ordering MEV on liquidation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The express lane owner identifies a liquidatable account on a perpetual futures protocol.</li>\n<li>The express lane operator maximizes their profit by executing a sandwich attack, taking advantage of their 200ms latency edge (or however Timeboost is configured). This predictability allows them to execute the liquidation unopposed and complete the sandwich strategy:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>They first sell a large number of perpetual contracts on the relevant market, driving the price lower by either consuming order book bids or impacting the protocol’s pricing inputs, such as open interest imbalance.</li>\n<li>They then liquidate the account, further pushing the price downward.</li>\n<li>Finally, they close their position by buying back the contracts at the now-lower price.</li>\n<li>As a result, users receive less collateral after the liquidation than they would have if the sandwich attack hadn’t occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Comparison with Current First-Come, First-Serve Transaction Flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An account becomes eligible for liquidation.</li>\n<li>Liquidators compete by spamming the network to execute the liquidation and claim the liquidation bonus.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Due to the competitive nature of liquidation rights, liquidators cannot easily predict or front-run transactions.</li>\n<li>While this results in network spamming, the liquidations remain efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Careful monitoring of express lane transactions should be sufficient at this stage as it is unclear whether Timeboost provides sufficient advantage to the express lane controller to execute harmful strategies. Keeping the NonExpressDelayMsec parameter shorter than block times could also be a useful mitigant in this regard.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-friction-to-the-adoption-of-limit-order-books-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-friction-to-the-adoption-of-limit-order-books-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-8\"></a>Friction to the adoption of limit order books on Arbitrum Orbit Chains</h2>\n<p>Introducing a 200ms latency could render fully on-chain limit order books impractical in the future from a market maker UX perspective. Market makers rely on low latency to cancel orders promptly, and the delay would increase the potential for by the express lane controller to trade on their stale prices before they are able to cancel them, putting market makers at a significant disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Considering the predominant DEX designs currently this is unlikely to be an issue on Arbitrum One or Nova, but application-specific Orbit Chains considering this might need to consider how this risk.</p>\n<p>Market making on limit order books</p>\n<p>On limit order book exchanges, there are typically an order of magnitude more cancelled orders than matched trades. The<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about/marketstructuredata-decile-quartile\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> SEC reports</a> that there are 14 cancelled orders for every matched trade in US stock markets. The reasons for this phenomenon are explored in more detail<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fire.12363\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> here</a> and are found to be primarily driven by adverse selection risks.</p>\n<p>Under Timeboost, when an arbitrageur controls the express lane, as we expect it to be much of the time, market makers are disadvantaged in the latency they experience relative to the arbitrageur. As a result, their stale prices would be vulnerable to arbitrage before they have the opportunity to cancel or update their orders.</p>\n<p>This can be tangibly explained with the following example. Imagine market maker XYZ in the ETH market submits a bid at 2499 and an ask at 2501, in line with the best bid and ask on CEXs. Then imagine the external price on these CEXs quickly changes to 2504 bid, 2506 ask. The arbitrageur will, with certainty, buy from XYZ on Arbitrum and sell on a CEX, putting XYZ into a short position off-market.</p>\n<p>While this risk exists with the current first-come-first-serve transaction ordering, arbitrageurs do not receive favorable treatment. Instead, the arbitrageurs will likely spam the network to compete against each other and the price-maker for the arbitrage opportunity. Under Timeboost, arbitrage is more likely, and market makers will have no option other than to widen their spreads as a result.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58637-conclusions-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-conclusions-9\"></a>Conclusions</h1>\n<p>While the ultimate impact of the Timeboost upgrade on the microstructure of time-sensitive transactions on Arbitrum is impossible to completely predict ahead of time, Chaos Labs finds the economic risks acceptable.</p>\n<p>We recommend closely monitoring the time sensitivities in and out of the express lane to ensure sufficient competition remains to mitigate abuse of the privilege in hard-to-predict ways. We also recommend monitoring to ensure that it does not lead to the enablement of cross-domain MEV, which could begin to harm users.</p>\n<p>Chaos Labs has performed an economic risk audit of the Timeboost upgrade and finds no material blockers to implementation.

Based on the stage of commitment, we can classify all existing deals into two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Signed agreements.</strong> The Arbitrum Foundation and the grant recipient or service provider have entered into an agreement. Most grant recipients will be entitled to grant payouts as milestones and/or other criteria are reached. The amounts in the table reflect the value of future financial obligations related to signed agreements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pre-agreement offer.</strong> An agreement has not yet been reached but is in negotiation. The Foundation has reserved funds to ensure we can act upon the commitment when an agreement is reached. The amounts in the table reflect the full value of the agreement.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation must have adequate reserves immediately available before it can make an offer to a potential partner. Given the competitive landscape, The Arbitrum Foundation must be able to make multiple offers to different partners at the same time. Also, the Foundation must be prepared for all offers to be accepted and reserve amounts accordingly even if negotiations fail at a later stage.</p>\n<p>With the above in mind, The Arbitrum Foundation is at a distinct disadvantage from extending competitive offers to strategic partners due to the size of our overall allocation from the DAO. The three major financial challenges currently facing The Arbitrum Foundation from extending continued support to ecosystem expansion are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tight budget.</strong> Relative to competitors, the budget that the Foundation can allocate for strategic partnerships is small and puts the Arbitrum ecosystem at a significant disadvantage. For example, if we consider allocations relative to token supply, Starknet has allocated ~20% to its Foundation and grants, Optimism has 25% for ecosystem funding, ZkSync has 19.9% for ecosystem initiatives, while The Arbitrum Foundation has 7.5% allocated, but to date, The Arbitrum Foundation has only had access to approximately 1.8% because of the vesting contract. Making competitive offers requires a lot of capital that we have not been allocated relative to other Foundations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Vesting.</strong> The Foundation can only make offers based on the ARB that has vested to date. This is because the ArbitrumDAO can clawback the funds at any time and we must have the ARB available to pay milestones. The Foundation is committed to being solvent at all times, so our assets should always exceed our contractual liabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Capital lockup.</strong> All committed ARB in a milestone-based agreement must be allocated until the agreement terminates. For example, we could run into a situation where a grantee has not yet hit their milestones, but we need to assume they will and hold the potential payout in reserve. Additionally, some agreements require capital lockup (like RWAs), in projects where the funds belong to the Arbitrum Foundation, but they are utilized by the strategic partner’s protocol.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, The Arbitrum Foundation does not yet have access to its full budget which has caused issues over the past year, but even if the vesting was complete, our budget still remains the smallest amongst all rollups. This impacts all programs run by The Arbitrum Foundation including strategic partnerships, technical advancement, educational and community activities.</p>\n<p>We believe the most straightforward approach to ensuring The Arbitrum Foundation can pursue competitive deals is by increasing our budget for strategic partnerships.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58573-proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58573-proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution</h1>\n<p><strong>Funding Request:</strong> 250 million ARB</p>\n<p>In light of the above mentioned challenges, we believe that there are several reasons why increasing our budget to specifically better support strategic partnerships is essential:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>High costs of pursuing partnerships.</strong> Strategic partnerships are essential for the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth, and these partnerships often come with significant capital investments from the Foundation. For example, onboarding RWAs is both challenging and capital-intensive, as experienced by the DAO as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expanding Orbit Chains.</strong> Despite more than 50 chains publicly announcing their intent to build using Orbit since the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program in January 2024, the rollup as a tech stack ecosystem is still in its early stages. Additional funding is required to enable The Arbitrum Foundation to pursue major Orbit partnerships and allow the Arbitrum ecosystem to access new markets, use cases and communities. Additionally we should note that sometimes part Orbit chain grants could be rebates on the revenue that they contribute to the Arbitrum DAO, creating a mismatch between the Arbitrum Foundation allocating resources and the DAO collecting chain fees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gateway to DAO.</strong> The DAO has previously contributed to onboarding partners via programs like STEP, however, the experience has been that most institutions are not inclined toward engaging and participating in public forums, and even when they do it is after extensive conversations with The Arbitrum Foundation and its service providers, who are making them aware of the opportunities and encouraging them to get involved. As front line enablers, The Arbitrum Foundation actively builds relationships with partners and encourages all partners to engage with the DAO. Most recent examples include Securitize (via BlackRock BUIDL) and Franklin Templeton.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proven track record.</strong> The Foundation has a proven track record of managing and allocating funds effectively for various initiatives, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/ArbitrumFoundationBiannualReport2024H1-c8e9ab997fe68ad09c0105181f9826d8.pdf\">2024 Biannual Progress Report</a> and successful collaborations with industry leading projects. Additionally, The Arbitrum Foundation has capitalized on emerging opportunities such as LRTs, RWAs and onchain gaming, ensuring the Arbitrum ecosystem remains competitive and innovative.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also believe the current vesting schedule for our entire budget is still critical to remain as is for setting expectations for the Arbitrum Foundation and holding us accountable for how we execute our mission statements. This sets a good example that all programs approved by the DAO must remain accountable and should not assume they can receive all their funding immediately.</p>\n<p>With the above in mind, we are requesting 250 million ARB from the Arbitrum DAO. The amount will solely focus on agreements fulfilling the following 3 criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Key opportunities exceeding 2 million ARB</li>\n<li>New agreements signed after approval of this proposal</li>\n<li>Contractual commitments lasting 1 year or longer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some foreseeable capital-intensive areas include, but are not limited to, expanding the Orbit Chain ecosystem, securing new RWA opportunities, and onboarding well-known TradeFi institutions on Arbitrum. Tokens will only be allocated on an as needed-basis and will only be exchanged as contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.</p>\n<p>The Foundation plans to expand on the special strategic partnership allocation in our future Transparency Reports. Our goal is to enhance visibility into how these collaborations are structured and how resources are allocated, giving the DAO a clearer understanding of the impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. At the same time, we remain committed to respecting any confidentiality provisions stipulated in such agreements. By balancing transparency with confidentiality, the Foundation aims to balance both the sensitivity of onboarding traditional institutions to Arbitrum and also providing updates to the DAO on how the funds are being spent.</p>\n<p>Our goal with this proposal is not to maintain the status quo, it’s to ensure that we can continue to foster ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. The funds will not be used for Arbitrum Foundation operating expenses, including marketing, operations, service providers, or existing signed agreements.</p>\n            <p><small>16 posts - 10 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-funds-to-bolster-foundation-s-strategic-partnerships-budget/26775\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-funds-to-bolster-foundation-s-strategic-partnerships-budget/26775","pubDate":"Thu, 12 Sep 2024 15:32:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26775"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-funds-to-bolster-foundation-s-strategic-partnerships-budget/26775.rss","#text":"[Non-Constitutional] Funds to Bolster Foundation’s Strategic Partnerships Budget"},"filter":false},{"title":"WINR Protocol STIP.B Bi-Weekly Updates 12.09.2024","dc:creator":"WINRProtocol","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<p><strong>Recap of the Previous Week</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ARB Received Last Disbursement:</strong> 45.000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks:</strong> 45.000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</strong></p>\n<p>Reward Conditional Main: 0xd525BaE6de08D1f65BE9CB4C09b8b6AD91ecCADD<br>\nClaimer: 0x860dec012b577C7fF62b6899581581CB4089AAf7<br>\nLotteryClaimer: 0x8d8Dd780dFa7413ac33aFc79053e4b6ad0c689dc</p>\n<p><strong>Contract address label Form 62 completed for all addresses:</strong>  Yes</p>\n<p><strong>ARB left over:</strong> 165.000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for leftover ARB:</strong> The program will proceed as scheduled.

For instance, low-fee networks are vulnerable to spam and DDoS attacks, and the way transactions are ordered impacts how quickly they are processed.</p>\n<p>Currently, Arbitrum chains use a First Come, First Serve (FCFS) transaction ordering system at the sequencer level. However, a <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167\">new proposal under consideration by ArbitrumDAO</a> suggests that Arbitrum One and Nova should adopt Timeboost. In contrast, Optimism uses a modified Priority Gas Auction model based on EIP-1559, while FastLane is employed within Polygon’s ecosystem. API3’s  OEV Network is specifically designed for Oracle-reliant transactions like liquidations.</p>\n<p>In the sections that follow, we will delve into these transaction ordering mechanisms and assess their potential impact on value capture.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58529-timeboost-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-timeboost-1\"></a>Timeboost</h1>\n<p>Timeboost is a newly proposed transaction ordering policy for Arbitrum chains. It aims to capture all available MEV for the chain owner while protecting users from harmful types of MEV behavior without sacrificing UX (by preserving fast block times and not adding further delays).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58529-first-come-first-serve-transaction-ordering-policy-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-first-come-first-serve-transaction-ordering-policy-2\"></a>First Come, First Serve Transaction Ordering Policy</h2>\n<p>Arbitrum chains currently order transactions on a First Come First Serve (FCFS) basis. Transactions are sequenced into blocks based on their order of arrival at the sequencer. In this case, MEV opportunities, like arbitrage, are captured by those whose transactions reach the sequencer the first. So, profiting from MEV opportunities usually boils down to winning a <strong>latency race</strong>. To reduce latency, competitive searchers spend heavily on building low-latency infrastructure and trying to co-locate their systems closer to Arbitrum One’s and Arbitrum Nova’s sequencer.</p>\n<p>With FCFS, transactions are included as and when they arrive, ensuring fast block times, up to 100ms. Additionally, without a public mempool-like structure, negative symptoms of MEV, like frontrunning and sandwich attacks, are eliminated. This is in contrast to what is seen on Ethereum Mainnet, where negative symptoms of MEV from <a href=\"https://eigenphi.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Sandwich attacks is multiple times higher than MEV from arbitrage.</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3d7c4e43e387c130985dfbbdcbc08e7202f8be91.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/8LVrRO1LbtaprW9hrXQRnnmrtdf.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3d7c4e43e387c130985dfbbdcbc08e7202f8be91.jpeg\" alt=\"4\" data-base62-sha1=\"8LVrRO1LbtaprW9hrXQRnnmrtdf\" width=\"690\" height=\"423\" data-dominant-color=\"223232\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Since the sequencing of transactions depends on the chronological order in which they arrive, searchers are incentivized to <strong>spam</strong> to improve the odds of their transaction being sequenced first. This is also a common MEV strategy known as back-running. This is a problem in low-fee chains because spam strains the chain’s infrastructure and contributes to congestion.</p>\n<p>While FCFS is a simple and straightforward ordering policy that reduces harmful MEV while preserving fast block times, FCFS contributes to spam on the network, which can result in congestion and strain on the network. Additionally, under FCFS, <strong>searchers are able to capture most, if not all, of the MEV</strong> in opportunities they identify and act on, leaving none for regular users, projects, and the DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58529-how-does-timeboost-make-a-difference-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-how-does-timeboost-make-a-difference-3\"></a><strong>How Does Timeboost Make a Difference?</strong></h3>\n<p>Timeboost introduces an auction where participants can bid for faster transaction inclusion in a dedicated \"express lane”. By default, the auction winner gets a 200ms time advantage for transaction inclusion over other transactions. So, with Timeboot, to win a MEV opportunity over other participants, searchers have to bid the highest to access the express lane to be first or use better strategies on alpha before others can even identify them. This shifts the competition from pure latency to a prediction &amp; bidding process. All the proceeds from the auctions go to the ArbitrumDAO (in the current proposal). The ArbitrumDAO then has the authority and flexibility to choose how the funds are spent.</p>\n<p>With Timeboost, transactions on Arbitrum can follow two paths. One is the Express lane, where the express lane controller (winner of the auction) can submit their transactions and receive no delay in their transaction being sequenced. Normal transactions submitted outside the express lane will experience a 200ms (default) time delay for transaction inclusion. The express lane controller can also endorse transactions sent by others with express lane treatment.  This would be possible as express lane transactions arrive at a separate RPC endpoint exposed by the sequencer.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/feab15af0a6fe667b0c43076cb24c1a1afd6a91a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/AkTP8rFXF6HoMprklsU8UYeBHWG.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/feab15af0a6fe667b0c43076cb24c1a1afd6a91a_2_690x384.jpeg\" alt=\"1\" data-base62-sha1=\"AkTP8rFXF6HoMprklsU8UYeBHWG\" width=\"690\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/feab15af0a6fe667b0c43076cb24c1a1afd6a91a_2_690x384.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/feab15af0a6fe667b0c43076cb24c1a1afd6a91a_2_1035x576.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/feab15af0a6fe667b0c43076cb24c1a1afd6a91a.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"22262B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58529-auction-set-up-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-auction-set-up-4\"></a><strong>Auction Set-up</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Auction Contract</strong></p>\n<p>The funds used by a prospective auction participant to place bids are deposited into this contract on L2.

These two types of MEV do not harm users, unlike sandwich attacks and frontrunning.</p>\n<p>Auctions are held and resolved every minute to determine the controller of the express lane for the following minute. The auctioneer accepts bids in the first 45 seconds and may take an additional 15 seconds to resolve. The winner or the current Express Lane license owner will have a 200 ms advantage for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>Auction participants in Timeboost have to make a deposit to bid. The minimum bid amount is set at 3 ARB or 0.001 ETH, depending on which asset the DAO chooses to implement. There is also a limit on how many times a bidder can place bids each round. Currently, this limit is set at 5 bids each round per-address. This helps prevent bidders from excessively spamming the auctioneer contract and performing a DDoS attack.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58529-auction-dynamics-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-auction-dynamics-5\"></a><strong>Auction Dynamics</strong></h3>\n<p>Winners could make use of the express lane in the following ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given that Timeboost hosts ahead-of-time auctions, there are two components of MEV capture. One is based on predictions of future MEV opportunities; another is by identifying and capturing MEV in real-time when in control of the express lane.</li>\n<li>Competitive searchers can build price prediction models that would allow them to predict  the size of MEV opportunities up to 15s into the future in scenarios like CEX-DEX arbitrage and liquidations. With this prediction, these searchers can decide whether to participate in the auction for express lane control &amp; can choose how much to bid. It is important to note that the transactions are not publicly visible in a mempool, given that transactions on Arbitrum chains are directly sent to the sequencer. With FCFS, searchers would have to be the fastest and engage in spam to be the first to capture MEV as it arises. With the Timeboost, the express lane controller has a 200ms time advantage to be first, improving their chances of capturing profitable MEV opportunities that they predict.</li>\n<li>Another strategy could be to continually try and win express lane control over longer periods of time, even at a short-term loss, and then re-sell those rights to other market participants for a long-term gain/profit. This is basically a secondary market for express lane rights.</li>\n<li>Express lane controllers may also share their lanes with other parties. This is likely in scenarios where both parties stand to gain the most when the opportunity is shared (MEV gained from sharing &gt; MEV extracted alone).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58529-value-accrual-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-value-accrual-6\"></a><strong>Value Accrual</strong></h3>\n<p>Auction proceeds are sent to Arbitrum DAO’s treasury. The use of the proceeds is up to the DAO to be determined. Proceeds from the auction can be collected in either ETH or ARB within the Arbitrum Treasury. This decision is up to the DAO to collectively make.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58529-fastlane-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-fastlane-7\"></a>FastLane</h2>\n<p>FastLane builds smart contracts and infrastructure that allow validators, apps, oracles, and wallets to capture MEV. One of their designs is used by validators to order transactions on the Polygon network. To set some context, Polygon also faced transaction spam issues. Transactions on Polygon follow two paths: direct and announced. In the direct path, transactions are directly propagated to a pre-determined number of validators and have a 500ms advantage over transactions in the announced path, where transactions are broadcasted in Polygon’s validator network. This path can be slower because most validators are not peered, i.e., not connected through a p2p network. Instead, they are connected through a set of sentry nodes that listen to transactions and then propagate them to validators.</p>\n<p>Sentries were placed to prevent DDoS attacks by controlling the flow of transactions to validators, but they also ended up being a bottleneck, causing delays. So why is spam here an issue? Transactions are randomly sent through either the direct or announced path. So, to be first and capture MEV opportunities, searchers have to spam transactions to increase their chances of being sent first through the direct path.</p>\n<p>FastLane helped reduce transaction spam and increased validator revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>PFL Nodes:</strong> These modified Polygon nodes act as intermediaries between searchers and participating validators. They connect to other PFL nodes, creating a dedicated network for transaction bundle propagation.</p>\n<p>Validators opt into the FastLane on Polygon by peering their nodes with at least one PFL node and modifying their existing sentry nodes to prevent random direct propagation of transactions. This ensures that all transactions intended for the FastLane system go through the PFL nodes and the auction mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>PFL Auction Contract:</strong> The contract manages auctions for transaction ordering. Searchers submit bids through this contract to win priority ordering. The contract optimistically executes the searcher’s transaction and then reverts it if the searcher’s bid is not paid in full by the end. This allows validators to sort transactions by bid amount without relying on simulations. If the bids aren’t paid in full, the MEV opportunity will be made available for the next bidder.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/fcebdbd11bc497062d766249d24fcb90060bcc62.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/A5rE8BGDK9Z5gofopjiIA0joF5o.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/fcebdbd11bc497062d766249d24fcb90060bcc62_2_690x385.jpeg\" alt=\"2\" data-base62-sha1=\"A5rE8BGDK9Z5gofopjiIA0joF5o\" width=\"690\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/fcebdbd11bc497062d766249d24fcb90060bcc62_2_690x385.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/fcebdbd11bc497062d766249d24fcb90060bcc62_2_1035x577.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/fcebdbd11bc497062d766249d24fcb90060bcc62.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"2A2330\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58529-auction-set-up-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-auction-set-up-8\"></a><strong>Auction Set-up</strong></h3>\n<p>FastLane uses Priority Gas Auctions to order transactions. Searchers using FastLane can have their bundles included over other transactions with a 500ms advantage. Searcher bundles are ordered based on their bid value. The higher the bid, the higher the priority.  Unlike Timeboost, Bidders on FastLane are not required to place any deposits to bid. This can make it easier for bad actors to spam bids to congest the auction and cause delays. This is a problem faced by many low-fee chains. Additionally, there is no one single winner in FastLane auctions. Priority ordering is given based on bid size to several participants.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58529-auction-dynamics-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-auction-dynamics-9\"></a><strong>Auction Dynamics</strong></h3>\n<p>FastLane runs an English auction where bids are visible to other bidders. But the auctions last randomly until the bids are propagated to the auctioneer. While searchers may see each other’s bids, it doesn’t mean they can view all bids in the auction and form their strategy around it, as they can’t rely on a +1 bidding strategy. The random auction duration adds this uncertainty to the process. Unlike Timeboost, there is no base bidding price. Bidding values can vary based on the amount of MEV that stands to be captured at any given moment.</p>\n<p>Given that bundles are prioritized based on bid value and Polygon runs a public mempool, FastLane is open to capturing all MEV opportunities, good and bad. Searchers can capture any real-time MEV opportunity, given that the FastLane runs in real-time. When an auction is in real-time, the winner of the auction can make use of the opportunity right after being rewarded. Searchers do not have to predict MEV opportunities in the future and place bids based on expected revenue that may have complications &amp; uncertainty involved.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58529-value-accrual-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-value-accrual-10\"></a><strong>Value Accrual</strong></h3>\n<p>All the proceeds collected through FastLane auctions go to Polygon validators. On the other hand, Atlas helps capture MEV on the app layer, but it is out of scope for this post as it is concerned with L2 transaction ordering policies. FastLane &amp; Atlas are mutually exclusive solutions and don’t require the other to operate.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58529-optimisms-priority-gas-auctions-eip-1559-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-optimisms-priority-gas-auctions-eip-1559-11\"></a>Optimism’s Priority Gas Auctions (EIP-1559)</h2>\n<p>Optimism and, consequently, Base, which is based on OP Stack, use Priority Gas Auctions based on <a href=\"https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/exec-engine.html#priority-fees-sequencer-fee-vault\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">EIP 1559</a>. OP Mainnet uses a private mempool, but OP Bedrock will be using a public mempool.</p>\n<p>Optimism’s PGA uses priority ordering based on the bid size, similar to FastLane. It runs an English auction where bids are visible to other bidders. This can lead to bidders changing their strategies based on the bids they observe. Certain strategies rely on spamming bids to overwhelm the auctioneer. This is especially problematic in low-fee chains as spam becomes an issue unless preventive measures such as deposits are in place or if there are any limits on the minimum and maximum number of bids that each participant can place.</p>\n<p>EIP-1559 doesn’t change the amount of blockspace supplied, so it should not change the level of fees (keeping the demand equal). If the spam results from users not knowing how much to bid precisely, EIP-1559 provides a clear price that users must pay to have an inclusion guarantee.</p>\n<p>But suppose the spam is caused by sophisticated actors who want to get their MEV transactions included and are involved in a priority gas auction against other sophisticated actors. In that case, 1559 is unlikely to help.</p>\n<p>Value accrual dynamics here are similar to FastLane’s, which also runs a priority gas auction. Much of the capture MEV would flow to the auctioneer (sequencer in this case), and some would be left with searchers.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58529-oev-network-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-oev-network-12\"></a><strong>OEV Network</strong></h2>\n<p>API3’s OEV Network is designed explicitly to capture MEV from liquidations. It is not a generalized transaction ordering policy like Timeboost &amp; FastLane. Individual lending protocols can integrate with the OEV Network while the rest of the chain continues to use its own ordering mechanism. OEV Network operates as an Arbitrum Orbit chain whose sole purpose is to host auctions to capture OEV. In our report <a href=\"https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/api3-the-state-of-oev\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>, we have detailed how the OEV Network operates and compared it with similar solutions.</p>\n<p>OEV Network auctions off the right to use an Oracle price update. This ensures that only the winning bidder can successfully liquidate a position. This contrasts block space auctions between searchers and block builders on Ethereum, where competing searchers lose ~80-90% of their liquidation revenue to block builders in the form of bribes to have their OEV transaction included.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58529-oev-network-architecture-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-oev-network-architecture-13\"></a><strong>OEV Network Architecture</strong></h3>\n<p>dAPIs/Oracles – API3’s dAPIs are data feeds from first-party sources operated by the data providers.</p>\n<p>Auctioneer Node – OEV Network auctions are conducted by the Auctioneer Node.

This amount will be used to place bids in auctions.<br>\nThe winning searcher then performs liquidations on the respective chain where the opportunity was present. To complete the liquidation, the searcher performs an atomic transaction in which it executes the Oracle price update, extracts OEV, and pays the bids. To ensure that searchers pay their bids when the data feed is updated, the bid amount will be included in the meta transaction utilizing the signature all the Oracle nodes added individually. This way, searchers must pay their bids to use the price update to capture OEV.</p>\n<p>Initially, OEV Network will also operate using an English auction and later transition to a First-Price Sealed-bid Auction (FPBSA) that is fully on-chain. Bidders submit their bids to the auctioneer in an encrypted format in this auction. Searchers would be unable to learn who their competitors are and how much they are bidding, preventing the drastic increase in the number of bids that will be placed on the chain. Only the auctioneer is allowed to view bidder identities and their bids. Once the auctioneer has viewed the encrypted bid values, the highest-paying bidder will be chosen as the winner.

This way, all the auction proceeds are captured by the OEV Network and shared with the lending protocol related to the liquidation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58529-conclusion-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58529-conclusion-16\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As stated above, auction designs heavily influence value capture and user experience. Timeboost, Optimism’s PGA, FastLane, and MEV-Boost are all down-stream auction designs where the auctioneer captures bid proceeds and from where the value flows to the validators or to the chain. OEV Network, on the other hand, is an auction held more upstream at the oracle level. Unlike other designs where the implementation is at the chain level, OEV Network requires integrations from individual lending protocols. Each integrated lending protocol can get a share in the auction proceeds.</p>\n<p>Sharing extracted value with the originators of order flow, i.e., users and protocols, should be an essential consideration for most of these designs.</p>\n<p>Even with the addition of Timeboost, Arbitrum can still maintain a maximum of 450 ms block time. It protects users from front-running and sandwich attacks as Arbitrum operates with a private mempool. Users sending their transactions to an Express lane controller would have to trust not to be front-run or sandwiched. To this end, a reputation system could be established to moderate Express lane controllers. Bid proceeds from Timeboost are directed to Arbitrum DAO’s treasury as revenue.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/87053a698681de47e96f1e50f435846ca6ee544d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/jgrEUlkw1mfshBgO0151O8giDpP.png?dl=1\" title=\"7\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/87053a698681de47e96f1e50f435846ca6ee544d.png\" alt=\"7\" data-base62-sha1=\"jgrEUlkw1mfshBgO0151O8giDpP\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" data-dominant-color=\"2B2C2D\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>It is important to note that most, if not all, of the parameters of each of the designs above, can be calibrated based on historical data and predictions that may improve the design’s performance and sustainability.

All milestones are reached, and Gains Network is planning to distribute the final 10,000 $ARB to their multi-sig this week.</li>\n<li><strong>DexPal</strong>: After multiple conversations with the DexPal team, it has become clear their protocol won’t be live for the public before the STIP.B program ends as some PerpDEX integrations aren’t finalized yet. Therefore, they won’t be able to host a gTrade-specific trading competition, and the GCGP Committee has voted to hold on to the 10,000 ARB that was budgeted for this campaign (and will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO before the cutoff date). However, as shown in t<a href=\"https://gov.gains.trade/t/dexpal-gcgp-bridge-grant-bi-weekly-report-week-6/93\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">heir latest bi-weekly report</a>, the gTrade integration is finished and therefore Gains Network will distribute the 5,000 $ARB that’s budgeted for this milestone.</li>\n<li><strong>Exodus:</strong> The Exodus x gTrade trading competition has has concluded on September 9th 23:59 UTC and Gains Network will distribute 20,000 $ARB among the winners this week.

A final bi-weekly report with all competition details will be shared in their next bi-weekly report, as well as Gains Network’s final report.</li>\n<li><strong>Blave:</strong> As shown in <a href=\"https://gov.gains.trade/t/blave-org-gcgp-bridge-grant-bi-weekly-report-week-8/94\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blave’s latest bi-weekly report</a>, they have unlocked their final milestone as well.

It has yet to be seen if they are able to run the trading competition before the cutoff date of September 23rd. Gains Network is monitoring the situation and final disbursement will depend on feasibility of said competition.</li>\n<li><strong>Mimik Finance:</strong> <em>Same as last update:</em> The project was excluded from the GCGP due to a lack of communication and failure to update on any progress. After conversations regarding the lowered grant size following their 6th placement in Snapshot votes, the GCGP Committee attempted to confirm their funding address multiple times. No response was received and no updates were given, leading to the decision to exclude the project from the program.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As of September 10th, the plans for GCGP distribution of ARB looks

This working group aims to deliver a proposal for the DAO for a vote in December after the detox period. The working group will proceed in three phases: discovery, framework design, and Approval. The discovery phase includes delegate/protocol interviews, analyzing past incentive performance and limitations, and researching other ecosystem / traditional government incentive designs. This research will be used to create guidelines for incentives and design a framework for utilization. Finally, the group will take this framework to make a final proposal, including demonstrable KPIs, for a broader DAO vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58421-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The DAO has consistently expressed interest in using incentives to attract users and protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, to date, we have not yet taken sufficient time to design from first principles, that is, to first understand the goals and objectives of the program, deploying incentives to achieve particular measures. Arbitrum has also not had a chance to thoroughly analyze past incentives’ performance nor design a robust framework that may last more than a few months. We believe funding a small working group would create a better incentive program. Through a focused effort, we will help the DAO produce a sustainable incentives framework to satisfy both delegates and protocols.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58421-how-previous-incentives-have-been-designed-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-how-previous-incentives-have-been-designed-4\"></a>How previous Incentives have been designed:</h3>\n<p>Prior Incentive Program Design</p>\n<p>STIP. STIP was created quickly using a DAO-wide working group funded by a foundation grant in response to the DAO voting down <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x6b001068a3aa7f58e0e334a1f717be2145eb4c7b3f3af479cd827020aa2993a6\">Camelot’s incentive proposal</a> and requesting a larger framework for granting protocol incentives. It was the first major DAO initiative and achieved the goal of creating a first attempt at incentives. While it was not a perfect program, it got the ball rolling and taught us about incentives.</p>\n<p>LTIPP. The creation of the LTIPP proposal was funded retroactively once it was passed. This proposal involved risk on behalf of the composing parties. It took four months of writing, lobbying delegates, and modifying the proposal to ensure ratification. The improvements of LTIPP focused on making operational changes to STIP challenges while providing incentives to protocols not funded in STIP. These changes allowed Arbitrum to broaden its incentive distribution while evaluating a new program structure that included the council and advisors.</p>\n<p>STIP.B. The creation of STIP.B was not funded. STIP.B was a grassroots effort by protocols that argued that incentives should continue for protocols that used STIP rewards correctly to keep the largest Arbitrum protocols focused on Arbitrum while other chains offered large grants to migrate.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58421-prior-program-design-flaws-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-prior-program-design-flaws-5\"></a>Prior Program Design Flaws</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"p-58421-insufficient-planning-period-too-rushed-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-insufficient-planning-period-too-rushed-6\"></a>Insufficient Planning Period (Too Rushed)</h4>\n<p>The previous incentive programs were designed under tight time pressure. With STIP, the DAO was rushing to get something started. With LTIPP, the DAO wanted to ensure we had a program to immediately follow STIP. With STIP.B, the STIP protocols tried to ensure they could follow a similar timeline to stay competitive with LTIPP.</p>\n<p>Without sufficient time, the DAO could not decide the concrete objectives of these programs. This has made it extremely hard to evaluate the success of the programs. Additionally, with a near-zero gap between programs, there was insufficient time to examine past performance and improve distribution efficiency. While LTIPP introduced the council and advisors to help protocols create better incentive plans, we need more data-driven guidelines on how protocols should utilize incentives to maximize return on ARB grants. Finally, because these programs were each planned independently, they have all been short 3-5 months as we have not had time to create a robust global framework to last 1+ years. This disconnection between programs has made protocols unsure of when their next chance at funding will be, making it much harder for them to plan their future in Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>At present, we have a three-month break from incentives. This window presents an opportunity to research and create a thoughtful Arbitrium Incentives program. To best take advantage of this time, it makes sense to have a group of stakeholders focused on and responsible for completing the necessary research. With the research in hand, this group may then deliver a framework and program design to meet the needs of all DAO stakeholders.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-58421-no-one-was-incentivized-to-create-a-long-lasting-and-sustainable-framework-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-no-one-was-incentivized-to-create-a-long-lasting-and-sustainable-framework-7\"></a>No One Was Incentivized to Create a Long-Lasting and Sustainable Framework</h4>\n<p>Presently, there is no compensation or incentives for the research, coordination, and planning of Arbitrum incentive programs. This is a nontrivial amount of work and requires both incentive research and operations research, ultimately translating these into effective program design. Without a clear commitment from Arbitrum, counterparties bear significant risks in performing this research. As a result, programs were underdesigned and underresearched.</p>\n<p>In the absence of the necessary incentives, past program design opted for an open incentives working group. This format led to a diffusion of responsibility and inefficiency. The proposal creation phase was focused on passing a DAO vote quickly instead of optimizing for the best possible program.</p>\n<p>A smaller group of responsible individuals will likely lead to better-focused outcomes. When a group is accountable to the DAO, we can expect better results as incentives are aligned with performance.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-58421-no-clear-objective-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-no-clear-objective-8\"></a>No clear objective</h4>\n<p>While everybody tends to agree, at a high level, that incentive programs should foster “growth” and “adoption,” we fall short of properly specifying the KPIs and the base ground values achieved before and after it. The byproduct is the inability to measure the effective success or failure. The lack of discussion on this topic will make every program meaningless.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58421-specifications-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-specifications-9\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58421-working-group-roles-responsibilities-and-deliverables-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-working-group-roles-responsibilities-and-deliverables-10\"></a>Working Group Roles, Responsibilities, and Deliverables</h3>\n<h4><a name=\"p-58421-qualitative-stakeholder-interviews-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-qualitative-stakeholder-interviews-11\"></a>Qualitative Stakeholder Interviews</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Interview delegates to understand what they would want to see from an incentive program</li>\n<li>Interview protocols to understand what they would want to see from an incentive program</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"p-58421-web3-and-traditional-market-research-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-web3-and-traditional-market-research-12\"></a>Web3 and Traditional Market Research</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Study the landscape of incentive programs in crypto in other ecosystems to avoid pitfalls and better understand benefits.</li>\n<li>Examine what categories and/or objectives a future incentives framework should include.

To achieve the best results, Arbtirum should assign a modest budget to ensure satisfactory delivery. Funding this working group will give the DAO more information in three months to make a smarter decision when voting on the next incentives program.</p>\n<p>Considering the scale of the programs, potentially 50,000,000+ ARB, an operational expenditure of approximately 0.4% is acceptable and reasonable examining market comparables. In general, fund operations cost around 2% per annum, exclusive of planning and setup costs. Our hopes are to vastly improve the performance of ARB incentive programs, leading to long term cost savings and efficiency gains.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58421-team-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-team-17\"></a>Team</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Matt StableLab: PM for STIP/LTIPP/STIP.B, Proposal Author LTIPP, MSS signer, Arbitrum delegate.</li>\n<li>JoJo: LTIPP/STIP.b Advisor, Grant committee of Questbook and UAGP, delegate in Arbitrum, MSS signer, product and risk analyst at Jones.</li>\n<li>Castle Capital: Research and Advisory Collective with experience as an LTIPP/STIP.b Advisor, a Media Publisher, a Protocol Consultancy, an MSS Member, and a delegate in the DAO</li>\n<li>404DAO: Arbitrum Delegate who served as a LTIPP Council member, MSS Member and Onboarding WG</li>\n<li>GMX: LTIPP Council Member, Active Arbitrum Delegate, One of the oldest and largest Arbitrum Protocols.</li>\n<li>Blockworks Research: ARDC Research Member, Active Arbitrum Delegate, published numerous reports on STIP</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58421-process-overview-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58421-process-overview-18\"></a>Process Overview</h2>\n<p>Only three steps are required to operationalize this proposal.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pass a Snapshot Vote to approve the Working Group budget.</li>\n<li>Working group members complete Foundation onboarding, including compliance and execution of required agreements.</li>\n<li>The LTIPP multisig transfers funds to each respective working group member.

These events can include, but are not limited to:\n<ul>\n<li>Virtual hackathons</li>\n<li>Non-crypto conference presence (RustConf, CES, etc.)</li>\n<li>In-person hackathons</li>\n<li>Side events</li>\n<li>Sponsorships of major events</li>\n<li>Arbitrum Days around the world (not just EthCC)</li>\n<li>Educational workshops (Stylus &amp; Orbit)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC and Disruption Joe, we will gauge community sentiment/attendance levels regarding certain events. If there is consensus to put on a certain event but there is no PM/event coordinator to lead the effort, the group will procure, select, and support service providers to make the vision a reality. Alternatively, if an events provider comes to the DAO with a proposal for an event that passes a snapshot vote with at least 100M votes in favor/abstain, the funds for that proposal will come from the 2025 events budget brought forth in this proposal.</p>\n<p>We propose the earmarking of <strong>$1.5M USD</strong> to fund this initiative, with any unused funds at the end of 2025 to be returned to the DAO treasury. <strong>4M ARB</strong> will be sent to a Foundation-controlled address to be liquidated into stablecoins, with any excess ARB immediately returned to the DAO treasury and the stablecoins to an MSS-controlled address. The ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe will be waiving payment to get this stood up, but we expect this initiative to fall under the OpCo once it becomes fully operational. We also envision a dedicated employee to lead the DAO’s event strategy within the OpCo, so this is more of an effort to get the ball rolling so we are properly prepared for 2025. We plan to have the OpCo established in early-to-mid 2025, and once an events coordinator is employed by this entity, the funds will be transferred to the OpCo while Entropy, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe will be relieved of their duties thereafter. Note that if the ADPC is not <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x66812a5c91fe5f590965148c76f1ca609fdc5ded722544673c275a3b2ed94549\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">re-elected</a>, this proposal may be updated to include pay for the ADPC. We will clearly articulate that change if it is required prior to moving on to a Snapshot vote.</p>\n<p>Also note that we are aware of an active <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-offsite-format-online-vs-irl/26629\">proposal</a> to fund a DAO offsite. There is also another proposal to fund <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-core-series-hack-humanity/26634\">GovHack Core</a> for the next year. If this proposal were to pass, and the two aforementioned proposals received 100M Yes/Abstain votes on Snapshot, the funds could come from this proposal’s budget rather than forcing service providers to navigate the onchain voting process (Tally). By earmarking funds through this framework, the DAO can remove the ~4-week Tally/ARB liquidation process thus enabling the DAO to move more nimbly and source a wider variety of potential service providers.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Events play a crucial role in strengthening the Arbitrum community and brand, attracting more users and developers to the ecosystem, expediting DAO initiatives by facilitating in-person collaboration, and providing avenues for alliance with other partners within the industry. While the Questbook program has done an excellent job in ensuring the Arbitrum brand is represented at smaller conferences across multiple regions, the DAO does not currently have a dedicated plan or budget for events. Larger Arbitrum events, such as Arbitrum Day, are left to the Arbitrum Foundation or Offchain Labs to organize. The DAO certainly appreciates what the Foundation and OCL do on the events front, but the DAO should serve a complementary role – which if enabled – will maximize Arbitrum’s overall ability to grow a healthy ecosystem and capture network effects in our speed and flexibility for deployment.</p>\n<p>There is significant value in aligning on the scope/timing of hackathons, GovHack-type events, and major events presence (such as EthCC, DevCon, etc). For example, a Stylus represents one of the most significant software upgrades in Arbitrum’s history – it could be wise for the DAO to ensure a Stylus-focused hackathon is planned for 2025 in an effort to bring more developers into our ecosystem and to improve dev tooling/infra. In addition to ecosystem events, it is very important for delegates to meet up in person at a regular cadence. We see how much more we can accomplish in-person time and time again, and we believe the DAO could formulate and execute on a grander strategy if these delegate offsites were formally planned/coordinated.</p>\n<p>Hosting events requires substantial upfront time and capital, typically involving 4-6 months of planning and $25-100k in down payments for venues, travel, accommodations, catering, and other expenses. Planning and funding events on a case-by-case basis are impractical due to the lead time and the lengthy DAO voting process. Recently, the DAO <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22498645709460639498013508413205734891453964526622655693207250687057651118730\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">approved</a> $309k to host an event at EthTH CC in Brussels. However, the proposal was not executed on-chain until approximately five weeks before the event. Hack Humanity, the entity behind the GovHack event, took on substantial risk by using its funds to secure a venue, caterers, and other necessities without a guarantee of DAO funding. Although Hack Humanity felt comfortable taking this risk due to previous collaboration with the DAO and assistance from Entropy Advisors, this upfront financial burden should not fall on service providers in the future. One off RFP processes would enable organizers to plan higher-quality events with the extra time &amp; budget provided. Alternatively, any service provider can gauge DAO sentiment directly via snapshot, which will drastically reduce the burden of the Arbitrum DAO governance process put on service providers.</p>\n<p>To ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the ability to represent itself at various events and to create new in-person experiences, we propose earmarking funds so this can be achieved in a streamlined manner. While we propose 4 core events in the section below, any DAO member can make a proposal to utilize these earmarked funds at any time. We are also happy to alter the below calendar in accordance with feedback received on the forum.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-proposed-events-calendar-for-2025-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-proposed-events-calendar-for-2025-3\"></a>Proposed Events Calendar for 2025</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/065d193859ec030a848c27fcea83e4db75a97aae.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/UikiO6VfeR3ZgpLROmeYi87zNY.png?dl=1\" title=\"Arbitrum DAO Events V3 (1)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/065d193859ec030a848c27fcea83e4db75a97aae_2_690x318.png\" alt=\"Arbitrum DAO Events V3 (1)\" data-base62-sha1=\"UikiO6VfeR3ZgpLROmeYi87zNY\" width=\"690\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/065d193859ec030a848c27fcea83e4db75a97aae_2_690x318.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/065d193859ec030a848c27fcea83e4db75a97aae_2_1035x477.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/065d193859ec030a848c27fcea83e4db75a97aae_2_1380x636.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B6BCBF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The above events were chosen based on the need to bolster Arbitrum’s presence at the industry’s top events. As mentioned above, the Questbook program has done an excellent job at making sure Arbitrum has a presence at smaller events across the globe. To date the events track has funded event initiatives in the following regions: Latam (8), Africa (6), India (4), APAC (4), and Europe (2).</p>\n<p>There are also ample opportunities to fund events in the back half of 2025 that align with Arbitrum’s strategic objectives (Ex. RustConf, GamesCon, Solana Breakpoint). However, with the expectation that a more comprehensive events strategy will be rolled up into OpCo upon the hiring of a full time events coordinator, we felt it was better suited to only establish a rough strategy for the first half of 2025 while leaving the door open for other service providers and community members to bring forth their own ideas.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58356-eth-denver-february-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-eth-denver-february-4\"></a>ETH Denver - February</h3>\n<p>ETH Denver is an Ethereum centric conference that has one of the largest attendee lists of any event throughout 2025. Arbitrum has historically had a presence here, but we would like to partner with OCL to bolster the DAO’s representation. We envision a very large floor space at ETH Denver (see photo below of Near’s booth at ETH Denver in 2024 for inspiration), with plenty of room for Arbitrum projects to showcase their products, delegates and other DAO contributors to talk to people who are interested in getting involved, and an area for more technical folks to ask OCL questions about the Arbitrum roadmap and tech upgrades. Last year, Arbitrum had a smaller 10x20 or 20x20 floor space at ETH Denver, but this year we want to go bigger. OCL will lead the charge on this front, but the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy can assist as needed and funnel ideas from the community to their team.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/11b5cb68df2614f42437162176baa40b075f70d1.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-22 at 1.15.50 PM\" data-base62-sha1=\"2wFBP5E7CWDEYFuju39LSp7oRLb\" width=\"690\" height=\"451\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58356-delegate-offsite-token-2049-april-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-delegate-offsite-token-2049-april-5\"></a>Delegate Offsite (@ Token 2049) - April</h3>\n<p>We believe that in-person networking and collaboration for top delegates is crucial to DAO productivity. As such, we are proposing a delegate offsite at Token2049 in Dubai for 2 days. Exact details have yet to be ironed out, but the primary goal of this event is to accelerate initiatives and to achieve alignment between various ecosystem contributors. The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy will work together to procure a venue, caterer, accommodations for attendees, etc., contingent upon significant attendance/availability from delegates and a successful snapshot vote with a defined budget.</p>\n<p>A sentiment check proposal for a DAO offsite passed on <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x21a4ec3fd338fa4eb2230d0e6131d1411639d94cf1b27864c9a3c1c722568c08\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a> on August 22, but no budget had been defined. The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy will bring forth a new offsite Snapshot with a budget included, and if passed, will begin procuring service providers to fulfill the event.</p>\n<p>Also note that Entropy Advisors plans to continue hosting smaller events for delegates as a part of our previously approved budget. These events are dinners or working spaces that are more casual in nature and do not require additional DAO funding. We believe that these are sufficient and nullify the need for a more formal delegate event funded by the DAO, but as mentioned, we will gauge community sentiment accordingly given the previously passed Snapshot.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58356-bitcoin-2025-may-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-bitcoin-2025-may-6\"></a>Bitcoin 2025 - May</h3>\n<p>The Bitcoin conference is the most widely attended conference in all of crypto, and is ofcourse a Bitcoin-focused event. However, as seen with the rise of “BTC L2s”, Ordinals/Runes/other inscriptions, etc, there is a growing appetite from developers, users, and VCs to build out more functionality on Bitcoin. Additionally, there is work being done to enable OP_CAT, which could enable trust minimized bridging of BTC to other chains. As such, we believe the Arbitrum DAO should have a presence here. There is no reason Orbit should not have a presence on Bitcoin, and the DAO recently signaled its support for Orbit deployments on alternative settlement layers via <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd6138aaca39742a1a56f3219a74a4258e0786aa5494cdfbe752f23277c1b947f\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">snapshot</a> vote. Bitcoin has served as the “Gateway” for bringing new people onchain in the past, and we believe targeting Bitcoin supporters is a good way to onboard new users into the Arbitrum ecosystem. We would like to work with OCL on this event, similar to the ETH Denver event, but the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy can procure a service provider and act as the point of contact in case OCL does not have interest in partnering with the DAO on this event.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58356-eth-cc-july-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-eth-cc-july-7\"></a>ETH CC - July</h3>\n<p>ETH CC, similar to ETH Denver, is one of the largest Ethereum-centric events of the year, and has historically been hosted in the EU. The event in 2025 is currently slated to take place in Cannes, France, but with the recent arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in France, this could potentially change. Nevertheless, this is an event that we believe the Arbitrum DAO should have a presence at, and we again suggest supporting OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to put this event together. In the scenario that OCL/the Foundation does not want to work with the DAO on this initiative, the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy will procure a 3rd party organizer to manage this event and will be in attendance to ensure things go smoothly. We are hopeful that OpCo will be stood up by this time, so there is a strong possibility that this event will fall under its purview rather than the aforementioned individuals/entities.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58356-other-events-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-other-events-8\"></a>Other Events:</h3>\n<p>We estimate the four events outlined above to cost somewhere in the range of $450-$600k, and would thus have a budget approved that is much higher than the actual outlays. We want to avoid scenarios where we are forced to overpay for event service providers, have a limited selection of service providers, or need to rush through the DAO process in order to meet deadlines for future events. Therefore, we are requesting a budget much larger than required so that if other community members wish to push forward an event, they can do so without having to go through the full governance process. Instead, we suggest that anyone can put forth an idea for an event in the first half of 2025, but that it can pull from these pre-approved funds via a snapshot vote that must garner 100M votes in favor/abstain. From there, the ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe can help procure service providers to put on the event, or the proposer themselves can serve as the project manager/event coordinator. This will cut down on the lead time to put on other events and give the DAO more negotiation power when organizing events on an expedited timeline. Some other events that we had envisioned include presence at non-crypto conferences such as RustConf or CES to attract new developers and users, virtual hackathons specifically focused on Stylus or Orbit with the help of a service provider like <a href=\"https://buidlbox.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Buidlbox</a>, <a href=\"https://ethglobal.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ETHGlobal</a>, etc. It is also important to note, that events with an expected cost under $50,000 should be routed through the Questbook program. The purpose of this proposal is to establish an events strategy for larger initiatives that require substantial funds and active project managers.</p>\n<p>We want to emphasize the fact that excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025. We felt some of the other events required a full-time project manager to ensure they go smoothly, and we do not want to take on more than we can handle. However, by requesting more budget than we require, anyone in the community can take lead on an event if there is DAO support.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-specifications-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-specifications-9\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>In order to eliminate the potential for event overload, we are capping the number of delegate gatherings to two for the year - but are leaving the number of ecosystem growth events open-ended. These events should be planned in such a way that no two events align too closely with one another on dates, with the exception of delegate offsites which could coincide with an ecosystem growth event at a major crypto conference given the convenience of planning travel arrangements. The 3M ARB should provide an ample budget regardless of ARB price action. While the primary goal of delegate offsites should be aligning ecosystem leaders and providing a dedicated place/time for more efficient in-person working hours, the ecosystem growth category is more vague in nature. However, all applicants should have clearly articulated goals for the events in line with the defined events strategy, i.e., driving the adoption of Stylus through a hackathon, generating thought-provoking governance proposals, onboarding new people into the DAO similar to GovHack, etc.</p>\n<p>For concrete examples of how this could work, we can take a look at the 2 proposals for events currently on the forum. The GovHack Core proposal has been brought forth by Hack Humanity, which serves as a great example of a scenario where the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy would not be needed in the process at all. Hack Humanity can take their proposal to Snapshot, and because they are the service provider themselves, there is no need for any type of procurement process. If the GovHack Core proposal passes snapshot with 100M votes in favor/abstain, the funds would be sent from the 2025 events budget (this proposal) and Hack Humanity could begin their planning. This would eliminate the ~4-week onchain voting process and potentially make it possible to put something together for DevCon in Bangkok in just ~2 months. This is a prime example of how earmarking an events budget will enable the DAO to move more nimbly. Please note that this proposal is only for 2025, so the previous example is only provided for illustrative purposes. However, it is quite possible that the DAO would rather fund GovHacks on an as-needed/case-by-case basis rather than a whole year, or even open up the event type to other service providers to get new actors involved or potentially lower the price.</p>\n<p>In the example of the proposal from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo\">@danielo</a>, there is no defined offsite facilitator. This is an example of a proposal that does not specify the service provider, so the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy could work together in procuring the proper coordinator if the proposal passes on Snapshot with 100M votes in favor/abstain. The procurement process should bring down overall costs by making the process competitive amongst service providers, and again reduces the lead time by foregoing the onchain Tally vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-flow-of-funds-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-flow-of-funds-10\"></a>Flow of Funds</h2>\n<p>To cover the $1.5M dollar-denominated expenses, 4M ARB would be earmarked and sent to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled wallet, with funds liquidated into a preferred stablecoin sent to the MSS and surplus ARB sent back to the DAO Treasury following the liquidation. Entropy Advisors, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC will be the point of contact for the MSS chair to greenlight any queued transactions. No transactions will be signed without confirmations from all 3 entities/individuals. The MSS may send stablecoins back to the Arbitrum Foundation in order to pay service providers with fiat if required.</p>\n<p>Updates related to funds spent, upcoming events and relevant details, a place to provide feedback or recommendations, or any other communications will be posted to the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/procurement-committee/27\">ADPC update thread</a> on the Arbitrum Forum. Alternatively, Entropy can post these to our <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/entropy-advisors-updates/50\">updates thread</a> on the Arbitrum Forum.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-steps-to-implement-and-timeline-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-steps-to-implement-and-timeline-11\"></a>Steps to Implement and Timeline</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>“Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025” Forum post (1-4 weeks)</li>\n<li>“Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025” Snapshot post (1 week)</li>\n<li>“Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025” Tally vote (~3 weeks)</li>\n<li>The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy Advisors can begin working with OCL and other SPs to ensure the events calendar brought forth comes to fruition.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We expect this process to take about 2-3 months in its entirety to get underway, which will provide the DAO ample time to prepare for its 2025 events.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58356-overall-ask-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58356-overall-ask-12\"></a>Overall Ask</h2>\n<p>The upfront ask to the DAO is $1.5M and the transfer of 4M ARB with the excess returned to the DAO post liquidation, but with just 1 delegate gathering and the 3 ecosystem growth events outlined in this proposal, the entire budget will not be utilized. However, as mentioned earlier, earmarking these funds gives the DAO the ability to act more nimbly when there is an opportunity to host an event. This will result in the DAO getting better pricing from potential service providers while ensuring the service provider has ample time to do what they do best - organize great events. The DAO can clawback funds from the MSS at any time via a snapshot vote that garners 100M votes in favor/abstain.</p>\n            <p><small>11 posts - 9 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734","pubDate":"Tue, 10 Sep 2024 18:32:22 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26734"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734.rss","#text":"Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025"},"filter":false},{"title":"Balancer DAO Bi-Weekly Update September 9th 2024","dc:creator":"zen_dragon","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/da9b597efa6976854c9d0bd099491ad88199951e.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vbSVg2tsQ9WjzAC4NczoDT9BYwC.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Balancer -

From the DAO’s perspective, yield-bearing assets are essential for maintaining long-term TVL for both Balancer and Arbitrum. Liquidity providers gain significant advantages from the diverse capital efficiency offered by Balancer’s unique pooling solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives:</strong> Balancer’s ARB incentive strategy is designed to channel BAL towards existing gauges on Arbitrum, enhancing the highest-yielding pools for liquidity providers in terms of returns and fees. By utilizing Balancer’s core pool mechanisms and the STIP Addendum boost settings, this strategy aims to foster a dynamic and sustainable environment for the most valuable asset classes on Arbitrum within Balancer. The objective is to maximize the capital efficiency of ARB incentives for both the Arbitrum ecosystem and the Balancer DAO. For a detailed overview of the incentive structure, please refer to our <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-balancer-stip-addendum/23288\">Addendum</a> post.</p>\n<p>Balancer has harbored several partner integrations which amplified the ARB flowing to our ecosystem. This includes tight ties with Aave and Gyroscope, which allowed Gyroscopes Rehype pools to harness the yield from Aave’s lending markets, including GHO, which resulted in more net ARB for Balancer LPs. Furthermore Galaxe has teamed up with Balancer to give new and recurring participants an opportunity to get to know our ecosystem and experience the tech that Balancer has to offer.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sjx8CuUfwDGWnjdhUQfrG4sDATs.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Balancer x Galaxe Arbitrum Quests\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"Balancer x Galaxe Arbitrum Quests\" data-base62-sha1=\"sjx8CuUfwDGWnjdhUQfrG4sDATs\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"34383A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Check out the quest board <a href=\"https://app.galxe.com/quest/Balancer/GCskLtvDZi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The pool for <a href=\"https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x8d58755ca11d2c7273fed72aeb637e38a66c228c00000000000000000000058c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sUSX </a>came in hot with 700k TVL and now reachd 1.3MM in TVL.

It is common for these initiatives to have a multi-signature wallet (multi-sig) committee responsible for managing and dispersing DAO-approved funds, following the terms agreed by the DAO via on-chain governance, as well as with the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836\">DAO recently approved the Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)</a>, so there will likely be greater standardization and streamlined multi-sig operations going forward. Accordingly, the Arbitrum Foundation would like to share some ‘Multi-Sig Best Practices’ based on its observations of the existing DAO-related multi-sigs. It is recommended that DAO-related multi-sigs, including the MSS, follow the guidelines and processes outlined below to adhere to high operational security (OpSec) standards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-signer-best-practices-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-signer-best-practices-1\"></a>Signer Best Practices</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use Secure Hardware:</strong> Maintain at least two hardware wallets with the same seed phrase. These hardware wallets should be exclusively dedicated to DAO-related multi-sig transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Dedicated Devices:</strong> Utilize a separate, dedicated laptop or device solely for signing transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Unique Signer Addresses (Keys):</strong> Use a unique signer address (key) for each DAO-related multi-sig wallet. Avoid reusing addresses (keys) across different DAO-related multi-sig wallets. Each unique signer address (key) can be generated from the same wallet (i.e. using the same seed phrase). All signer addresses must be shared with the Arbitrum Foundation to pass compliance.</li>\n<li><strong>Unique Payment Address:</strong> If you receive compensation for performing multi-sig signer duties, use a separate address from your signer address(es) to receive payments. All payment addresses must be shared with the Arbitrum Foundation to pass compliance.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction Simulation:</strong> Always simulate transactions using Tenderly (available on Safe) to ensure the transaction performs as intended before signing.</li>\n<li><strong>Verify Information:</strong> Double-check all relevant sources of truth, such as the on-chain Tally proposal, before signing any transaction. If in doubt, do reach out to the DAO Relations team at the Arbitrum Foundation (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/raam\">@raam</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cliffton.eth\">@cliffton.eth</a>), and to fellow signers, to ensure that all details about the queued payment(s) are accurate as per the on-chain Tally proposal and agreement terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise Caution and Seek Assistance:</strong> If you are unsure about a transaction, do not sign. Raise any concerns with fellow signers immediately. If you encounter any technical issues, promptly ask for help.</li>\n<li><strong>Bookmark Essential Links:</strong> Bookmark links to DAO-related multi-sig wallets or rely on pre-established, trusted sources. Avoid clicking on links provided by external parties.</li>\n<li><strong>Availability Notification:</strong> Inform fellow signers at least 24 hours in advance if you expect to be unavailable or unable to sign transactions for any period.</li>\n<li><strong>Report Key Issues:</strong> Notify other signers and the Arbitrum Foundation via email immediately if you lose access to your signing keys or suspect they have been compromised.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-setting-up-a-multi-sig-wallet-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-setting-up-a-multi-sig-wallet-2\"></a>Setting Up a Multi-Sig Wallet</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initial Communication:</strong> All signers should exchange email communications and share a signed message from the key to be installed. The message should include:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum account address: “[signer address]\"</li>\n<li>A statement identifying the signer and the multi-sig wallet they are joining: “[Message: I am X and I am joining the Y multi-sig]\"</li>\n<li>Signature hash: ”[signature]\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Key Authentication:</strong> Conduct 1-to-1 and group calls among signers to authenticate the signing key with the owner. Do not rely solely on Telegram for key authentication.</li>\n<li><strong>Clawback of Funds:</strong> As the ultimate owner of its funds, the ArbitrumDAO should be able to clawback funds from any of its multi-sigs by executing a respective Tally proposal - which can be enabled if multi-sigs are set up using the Zodiac Governor Module, for example.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-adhering-to-terms-and-conditions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-adhering-to-terms-and-conditions-3\"></a>Adhering to Terms and Conditions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Review Proposals Carefully:</strong> Always review the respective on-chain Tally proposal before disbursing any funds, as they are the source of truth for payment schedules, payment caps, recipients, and other important details. If you have doubts, please reach out to the DAO Relations team at the Arbitrum Foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>Follow Agreements:</strong> Abide by the terms and conditions of any agreements made with the Arbitrum Foundation. For example, only sign transactions to distribute funds which (a) have been approved by the ARB Community per the Tally proposals, (b) have satisfied appropriate compliance measures (such as know-your-customer checks) and documentation (as applicable) as confirmed by Foundation and (c) comply with the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\">ArbitrumDAO Constitution</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> If there is a conflict among proposals regarding fund disbursement, contact the Arbitrum Foundation for guidance.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance Confirmation:</strong> Never disburse funds without receiving confirmation from the Arbitrum Foundation that all compliance and necessary background work have been completed.</li>\n<li><strong>Recipient Detail Changes:</strong> If a recipient needs to update any details (e.g. the address for receiving funds), they must contact the Arbitrum Foundation to restart the compliance process before any payments can be made.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-communication-protocol-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-communication-protocol-4\"></a>Communication Protocol</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Telegram Group:</strong> Establish a Telegram group that includes all signers and members from the Arbitrum Foundation’s DAO Relations team.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-channel Communication:</strong> Do not rely solely on Telegram. Regularly speak with fellow signers through calls to ensure clear communication.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction Request Template:</strong> When requesting signatures, use a consistent template. This could either be through a bot (e.g. Onchain Den) or a manual template that includes:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Nonce</li>\n<li>Payment details</li>\n<li>Amount</li>\n<li>Compliance status</li>\n<li>Multi-sig wallet name (avoid using links)</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Transparent Queuing:</strong> For greater transparency, the person queuing the transaction can record a Loom video of the process and share it with the other signers.</li>\n<li><strong>Record Keeping:</strong> Maintain a shared record of payments made (e.g. on Google Sheets) with version history that tracks:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Recipient name</li>\n<li>Recipient address</li>\n<li>Payment amount</li>\n<li>Compliance completion status</li>\n<li>Recipient address confirmation</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Transaction Confirmation:</strong> Signers should confirm on their Telegram group when they have signed or executed a transaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Periodic Reporting:</strong> Publish transaction summaries on the DAO forum at regular intervals (e.g. monthly) to maintain transparency.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-notification-process-between-arbitrum-foundation-and-signers-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-notification-process-between-arbitrum-foundation-and-signers-5\"></a>Notification Process Between Arbitrum Foundation and Signers</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>KYC Completion:</strong> ‘Recipient A’ completes KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>Notification:</strong> The Arbitrum Foundation informs ‘Multi-Sig A’ via email that ‘Recipient A’ is eligible for payment.</li>\n<li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> ‘Multi-Sig A’ acknowledges the update with the Arbitrum Foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>Address Verification:</strong> ‘Multi-Sig A’ verifies with ‘Recipient A’ that they control the KYC-approved address by requesting an on-chain signature, and sharing this proof over email.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction Queuing:</strong> ‘Multi-Sig A’ queues the transaction (or batch of transactions) and shares the details with other signers using a transaction form template, Onchain Den bot, Google Sheet, and/or Loom video.</li>\n<li><strong>Signer Communication:</strong> Signers coordinate and confirm when they have signed the transaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution Notification:</strong> Once the transaction is executed, ‘Multi-Sig A’ communicates this update to the Foundation and the DAO via the forum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-key-terms-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-key-terms-6\"></a>Key Terms:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet:</strong> Wallet that requires multiple private key signatures to execute transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Signer:</strong> Member of a multi-sig wallet</li>\n<li><strong>Hardware wallet:</strong> Physical device (often resembling a USB pen), that securely stores private keys, offline.</li>\n<li><strong>Seed phrase:</strong> Sequence of random words that stores the data required to access or recover private keys</li>\n<li><strong>Signer address:</strong> The public address (an ENS or a randomly generated string of numbers and letters), like an email address, of a member of a multi-sig wallet</li>\n<li><strong>(Private) key:</strong> Randomly generated string of letters and numbers, like a password, that allows a respective signer to sign and execute transactions</li>\n<li><strong>Payment address:</strong> Address of a member of a multi-sig wallet used to receive compensation</li>\n<li><strong>Recipient:</strong> A DAO stakeholder who receives funding from a DAO-related multi-sig</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post -
