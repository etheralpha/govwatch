This proposal hit a lot of good notes with parts of the community and was delivered by a liked and reputable team. However, it’s important to listen to the key messages and feedback coming into this vote which ended up with 61% of delegates against.</p>\n<p>Some of the key messages arising from this result can be summarised as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees were deemed too high (flat 1%) and potentially not aligned properly with the DAO (eg. based on performance rather than management)</li>\n<li>The size was too big, especially for a single treasury manager</li>\n<li>There was a lot of pushback on the lack of an RFP process, particularly given the size, fees, and the stark contrast to the rigorous process followed in other programs such as STEP</li>\n<li>There were a couple of comments around operational risk and importance of infrastructure diversification</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There were concerns around the optimal amount to diversify for a treasury denominated mainly in ARB (headline dollar number is not a “real” number)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There was some discussion around the tradeoff between “yield” on stable coins vs “higher circulation” of tokens in the market which could further depress ARB price making the whole proposition less attractive in the first place</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Questions around the point of selling ARB upfront vs letting contributors sell it when they need to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No plan to maintain the ARB price and thus neglecting security of the protocol</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Debate around the size of the Oversight Committee (e.g. that it should be increased from 3 to 5)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is clear that no-one stands to benefit from the current lack of strategy and process when it comes to deciding the fate of one of the largest treasuries. It’s essential to first have a DAO-wide conversation about treasury management, its purpose, and the amount of ARB we should allocate towards it. This conversation should be facilitated by a DAO oversight committee working towards this particular deliverable.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57181-proposal-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57181-proposal-5\"></a>Proposal</h1>\n<p>We propose the establishment of a DAO Treasury Oversight Committee to establish treasury management strategy &amp; process, undertake operational tasks of deploying capital and taking care of monitoring and governance of underlying treasury managers.</p>\n<p>To get there we propose two key steps:</p>\n<p>Step 1: Feedback &amp; discussion phase (two weeks)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asking delegates to provide feedback on this RFP process to create a Treasury Oversight Committee</li>\n<li>Avantgarde to review feedback and update the proposal accordingly into a final RFP which is published and voted on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Step 2: Nomination period for DAO Oversight Committee</p>\n<p>The DAO Treasury Oversight Committee will be responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposing the overall strategy and objectives for the Arbitrum DAO. Note: It is of extreme importance to strike the right balance between diversification of assets vs more circulating ARB liquidity in the market. It is important for the Committee to make a strong case for how much ARB should be diversified (if at all), into what assets, and why. This proposal will be voted on in a DAO-wide vote.</li>\n<li>Creating an RFP process to search for and appoint treasury managers.</li>\n<li>Screening for and assessing candidates looking to run treasury management strategies.</li>\n<li>Providing overall thoughts and expertise for DAO delegates to vote in a more informed and effective way.</li>\n<li>Facilitating the allocation of treasury assets to underlying treasury managers through operation of treasury management infrastructure where relevant.</li>\n<li>Defining selection criteria to the assessment process which considers technical approach, provider diversification, operational set up, fees &amp; rewards, legal set up, recourse rights, etc</li>\n<li>Monitoring of treasury managers and ensuring adherence to agreed mandates, including deliverables of relevant performance reporting.</li>\n<li>Where necessary, initiate the governance process for replacement and/or reallocation from treasury managers who are deemed to be underperforming in relation to their agreed mandate or where there is evidence the managers are not behaving in the DAOs best interests.</li>\n<li>Holding quarterly community calls updating on the progress and performance of managers and giving room for community feedback.</li>\n<li>Management the process from start to finish as well as the ongoing monitoring and removal process of appointed managers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Part 3: Implementation (To be governed by the Treasury Oversight Committee)</p>\n<p>The Treasury Oversight Committee will be responsible for overseeing the overall strategy implementation which was put forward in Part 2 and voted on by the DAO. This will include;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking the RFP process live in such a way that seeks a competitive and diversified approach on both manager and infrastructure level</li>\n<li>Ensuring that infrastructure being used is transparent and non-custodial where possible</li>\n<li>Being clear about what kind of strategies it is seeking managers for (eg. yield on ARB, diversification of ARB into stables &gt; stable coin yield, etc).</li>\n<li>Managing price impact of ARB if and when necessary (or ensuring that any 3rd party vendors do)</li>\n<li>Overseeing the allocation of funds to chosen managers</li>\n<li>Monitoring and governance around managers (checking reporting, due diligence, regular calls, etc).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Running an open and competitive RFP process achieves the best outcomes for all stakeholders involved. It also promotes diversification at a manager and infrastructure level which is in line with the decentralised values of the DAO.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57181-treasury-oversight-committee-nomination-template-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57181-treasury-oversight-committee-nomination-template-6\"></a>Treasury Oversight Committee Nomination Template</h1>\n<p>To kick off the process after the initial two week review, we would recommend that qualified community members/ organisations who are interested in applying for the Treasury oversight committee put forward their nominations before September 15th, 2024.</p>\n<p>These could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name and/or organisation (if relevant)</li>\n<li>What relevant experience do you have for this role?</li>\n<li>What familiarity do you have with the ARBITRUM DAO?</li>\n<li>Examples of previous work (where possible)</li>\n<li>Time commitment: Can you commit a minimum of 10 hours per week to serve as part of this committee?</li>\n<li>Can you share any references?</li>\n<li>Do you have any examples of relevant past work that you can share?</li>\n<li>Declaration of conflicts of interest (if any)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We welcome feedback and suggestions on this.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57181-voting-eligibility-conflicts-of-interest-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57181-voting-eligibility-conflicts-of-interest-7\"></a>Voting Eligibility &amp; Conflicts of Interest</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Entities who applied to be a member of the DAO Treasury Oversight Committee or voted in in the election of members to the DAO Treasury Oversight Committee should be ineligible to apply as a treasury manager during the RFP process.</li>\n<li>When the DAO Treasury Oversight Committee initiates a vote of no confidence in a treasury manager, entities related to any treasury manager who currently has an allocation are not eligible to vote.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57181-timeline-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57181-timeline-8\"></a>Timeline</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Two week review and feedback process for this proposal before going to live vote</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Election of a three member DAO Treasury Oversight Committee via a two week application period and five day Snapshot vote.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each voter will select a maximum of three committee applicants to vote for.

It allows the ArbitrumDAO to spend funds from its treasury alongside upgrading any smart contract that governs Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. The on-chain smart contract suite includes a voting protocol alongside a series of contracts that will forward the proposal’s intended action to the correct destination before executing it.</p>\n<p>The proposal focuses on extending the time delay between when the voting protocol has concluded and the time it takes for the successful proposal to be passed along by the system until it is in the right destination to be executed. The focus is on the <em>L2 Core Time Lock</em> contract that lives on Arbitrum One and proposes changing the delay from 3 days to 8 days which effectively increases the delay by an additional 5 days.</p>\n<p>There are two benefits to increasing the delay:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security Council.</strong> The Security Council will have more time to act if a malicious proposal is passed by the ArbitrumDAO for whatever reason.</li>\n<li><strong>Exit window.</strong> Users will have more time to withdraw their assets from Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova if they are worried or not satisfied about how a proposal intends to change the smart contracts that govern Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, by increasing the exit window, it will also update the status of Arbitrum by L2Beat and replace a red slice with a yellow slice. This will help Arbitrum move one step closer towards a Stage-2 rollup.</p>\n<p>The downside of increasing the delay is that all constitutional proposals, primarily for upgrading the smart contracts, will be delayed by an additional 5 days. It does not impact or add an additional delay to any spending from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury including ARB and ETH.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57165-time-lock-extension-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57165-time-lock-extension-2\"></a>Time Lock Extension</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7804eaf2447a80a7fe71b0255dc311c185c464de.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/h7JPCULYr15M3H72WufWafA4ofs.png?dl=1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7804eaf2447a80a7fe71b0255dc311c185c464de_2_624x316.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"h7JPCULYr15M3H72WufWafA4ofs\" width=\"624\" height=\"316\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7804eaf2447a80a7fe71b0255dc311c185c464de_2_624x316.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7804eaf2447a80a7fe71b0255dc311c185c464de_2_936x474.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/7804eaf2447a80a7fe71b0255dc311c185c464de_2_1248x632.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EEF0EA\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Image:</em> <em>Overview of the Current Time Locks</em><p></p>\n<p>All proposals voted on and passed by the ArbitrumDAO must pass through an L2 Time Lock before it can move onto the next stage.</p>\n<p>There are currently two L2 Time Locks that are implemented via the on-chain governance smart contracts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>L2 Treasury TimeLock.</strong> Delays all spends from the ArbitrumDAO’s ETH Treasury.</li>\n<li><strong>L2 Core TimeLock.</strong> Delays any actions related to on-chain upgrades.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposal focuses on the Core L2 TimeLock.

We also provide a detailed timeline of the anticipated Upgrade Rollout and information on the current and new Governor contacts.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57124-background-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57124-background-2\"></a>Background</h1>\n<p>The Governance Upgrade has been funded by a <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387\">proposal from Tally</a> and the upgrade implementation by ScopeLift has already been <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governor-v2-review/26118/1\">reviewed</a> by OpenZeppelin to ensure it is secure. ScopeLift has since <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governance-smart-contract-upgrade-technical-details/24642/6\">shared</a> the finalized contract code and migration scripts which have been available for the community to review for the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>As ScopeLift moves forward to propose the upgrade, it’s important to ensure that the Arbitrum community is aware of the need for a moratorium on new proposals during the early stages of the upgrade process. This is due to the fact that the upgrade is being performed by migrating both the Treasury and Core Governor contracts to new smart contracts, rather than performing a proxy upgrade. ScopeLift has specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend that once this proposal is onchain, no new proposals are created until after it passes… (or fails, of course). If a proposal were to be created during this time, it would likely get stuck and have to be resubmitted to the corresponding new Governor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given this requirement, it’s important that all governance participants are aware and abstain from submitting new proposals to the current governance contracts once the Upgrade Proposal is submitted.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57124-upgrade-rollout-timeline-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57124-upgrade-rollout-timeline-3\"></a>Upgrade Rollout Timeline</h1>\n<p>Given the requirement for a proposal moratorium while the Upgrade is pending, it’s important that all governance participants are made aware of each stage of the Upgrade Rollout. As such, we recommend all delegates review and understand the following stages of the upgrade timeline below. <em>Please note that some dates are estimates due to the potential for small extensions or delays in the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">governance process</a>.</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Now until Sept 1st</strong>: Any proposals that governance participants wish to submit on-chain before the Upgrade must be submitted before Sept 1st. This ensures that these proposals can be passed and executed before the current governance contracts are deprecated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>On Sept 2nd</strong>: A Proposal will be submitted to upgrade governance through a migration to the new Governor contracts. <strong><em>Any proposals that may be unwittingly submitted to the current Governor contracts after this point will be unable to execute and need to be resubmitted to the new Governor contracts.</em></strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sept 2nd to Sept 19th:</strong> The Upgrade Proposal will go through a 3-day review period followed by a 14-day vote. Once quorum is reached on the Upgrade Proposal, delegates may consider submitting proposals to the new Governor contracts, although this comes with some risk before the proposal is executed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sept 19th to Oct 4th</strong>: Assuming the Upgrade Proposal has passed, it will be pending execution, taking its usual path of going from the L2 Timelock, to the L1 Timelock, and finally to the L2 Executor which can make upgrade calls on the L2 Timelock. During this time, DAO infrastructure tools, such as Tally, should begin the process of migrating to use the new Governor contracts targeted in the Upgrade, while still preserving the history of prior proposals from the old Governor contracts. This will ensure that all new proposals submitted on-chain by delegates will default to the new Governor contracts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Oct 4th</strong>: The Upgrade Proposal will be executed with a call to the respective timelocks to remove the old Governor’s proposer and canceller roles and add those roles for the new Governors. This will complete the upgrade with new governance contracts having the role permissions necessary to execute any proposals submitted prior.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57124-proposal-moratorium-preliminary-submissions-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57124-proposal-moratorium-preliminary-submissions-4\"></a>Proposal Moratorium &amp; Preliminary Submissions</h1>\n<p>Given the upgrade timeline, there will need to be a moratorium on proposals submitted to the DAO while the Upgrade is taking place. The least risky approach would be to avoid any on-chain proposal submissions between the time that the Upgrade Proposal is submitted and its execution nearly 1 month later. However, there is an option for proposals to be submitted to the new Governor contracts prior to the execution of the Upgrade. This allows new proposals to be submitted ~2 weeks sooner with only the minor risk that these proposals are disrupted by an unforeseen issue with the execution of the Upgrade Proposal.</p>\n<p>Given the tradeoffs, we propose a Proposal Moratorium for delegates to follow along with the option for proposals to be submitted in a Preliminary Period while the Upgrade execution is pending:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proposal Moratorium Period (Sept 2nd to Sept 19th)</strong>: Proposals should <strong>NOT</strong> be submitted to ANY Arbitrum Governor contracts between the time of the Governance Upgrade Proposal submission and the end of the Voting Period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preliminary Proposal Submission Period (Sept 19th to Oct 4th)</strong>: Proposals <strong>MAY</strong> be submitted to only the NEW Arbitrum Governor contracts between the end of the Voting Period (assuming the proposal has passed) and the Upgrade execution. Any proposals submitted during this time take the risk of an issue in the Upgrade execution disrupting their proposal, although that risk is minimal and will simply require the proposal to be resubmitted later. Tally (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/frisson\">@frisson</a>) has committed to migrating their platform to the new Governor contracts during this period so that proposals can be submitted with minimal friction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-57124-governor-contract-addresses-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57124-governor-contract-addresses-5\"></a>Governor Contract Addresses</h1>\n<p>ScopeLift has already deployed the new governance contracts that will be utilized in the Governance Upgrade.

We specifically ask that all delegates ensure they understand and agree to adhere to the following recommendations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you have an on-chain proposal to submit in the near future, please do so BEFORE Sept 1st when the Governance Upgrade is scheduled to begin using the current legacy Governor contracts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do NOT submit any proposals on-chain during the Moratorium Period (Sept 2nd to Sept 19th) prior to the end of the voting period for the Governance Upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you wish to submit a proposal during the Preliminary Proposal Submission Period (Sept 19th to Oct 4th), please ensure that you understand and accept the potential risks, however minor. We highly recommend waiting until Tally has confirmed completion of their migration to the new Governor contracts before submitting proposals during this period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the Upgrade Rollout is complete, ensure that you only use the new Governor contracts for all proposal submissions going forward.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This Upgrade Rollout plan has been developed in cooperation with ScopeLift, Tally, and the Arbitrum Foundation for which we greatly appreciate their support.

The sequencer generates income by collecting the delta between gas fees paid by users and the Ethereum settlement cost.

This has lowered the gas fees users pay to improve their user experience, but it has also lowered the DAO’s net profit.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/59867a03690f01d2f56a4950c9bd7bdf043e22bd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/cLYBNDGq5RlSzrPTfzXGJL0flmJ.png?dl=1\" title=\"arbitrum_sequencer_revenue,_expenses_decline_post-dencun (1)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/59867a03690f01d2f56a4950c9bd7bdf043e22bd_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"arbitrum_sequencer_revenue,_expenses_decline_post-dencun (1)\" data-base62-sha1=\"cLYBNDGq5RlSzrPTfzXGJL0flmJ\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/59867a03690f01d2f56a4950c9bd7bdf043e22bd_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/59867a03690f01d2f56a4950c9bd7bdf043e22bd_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/59867a03690f01d2f56a4950c9bd7bdf043e22bd_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"14171B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Arbitrum’s sequencer has generated $123M in revenue from transactions and ~$40M in profit after L1 settlement fees. In the 12 months leading up to EIP-4844, Arbitrum’s Sequencer generated $21.6M profit. Since EIP-4844’s arrival in March, Arbitrum’s sequencer has generated $10M, representing an annualized pace of $25M. The arrival of blobs have drastically reduced both revenue and expenses for rollups. Arbitrum’s profit margin is much improved, but its $10M profit in the first 5 months after 4844 is significantly propped up by outlier events. In the week of June 17, Arbitrum earned $3.5M profit, benefitting from an uptick in activity during the LayerZero TGE.</p>\n<p>These outlier events are difficult to forecast, and perhaps give an overly optimistic outlook on Arbitrum Sequencer profit, but these one-off events are commonplace in crypto and will continue to occur.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57008-orbit-chains-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57008-orbit-chains-3\"></a>Orbit Chains</h3>\n<p>Arbitrum Orbit chains are L3s.

Revenue can be exponential here if the number of Orbit chains deployed continues to increase.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b27fa44735f1beb8e8b9f4cd56896a136848bd19.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pt4szus2fhZeSOZUXpZcqJH9oCZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"base_leads_rollup_profit,_demonstrates_bull_case_for_orbit_1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b27fa44735f1beb8e8b9f4cd56896a136848bd19_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"base_leads_rollup_profit,_demonstrates_bull_case_for_orbit_1\" data-base62-sha1=\"pt4szus2fhZeSOZUXpZcqJH9oCZ\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b27fa44735f1beb8e8b9f4cd56896a136848bd19_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b27fa44735f1beb8e8b9f4cd56896a136848bd19_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b27fa44735f1beb8e8b9f4cd56896a136848bd19_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"14181D\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Base generated $51M profit in year 1, with ~$6.4M going to Optimism. If the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem generates Base-tier profits, Arbitrum DAO would see about $3.3M annually. Base is in a league of its own and assuming any Orbit chain alone will achieve Base’s traction is naive. Arbitrum’s strategy with Orbit is geared more towards attracting a multitude of different projects to launch L3s. Zora network is a more intuitive comparable for Orbit chains early on. If Arbitrum succeeds in kickstarting a vibrant ecosystem of Orbit chains, they could potentially rival base profits in aggregate.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57008-timeboost-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57008-timeboost-4\"></a>Timeboost</h3>\n<p>Timeboost is a transaction ordering policy proposed by the Arbitrum Foundation. It enables auctions to reward winners with transaction advantages. This is beneficial for the DAO as it effectively takes a solid percentage of the MEV that bots are generating and collects it as revenue for the DAO. These auctions can be paid in ETH or ARB.

Roughly 6M ARB per month will hit the market through DAO expenses, and 92M ARB/month will come from team and investor unlocks. This is a total of 1.2B ARB per year, not including any additional DAO spending. This represents 36% of ARB’s 3.3B circulating supply and $700M in annual sell pressure at ARB’s current price of $0.57.</p>\n<p>Becoming the first L2 token to share revenue with stakers will be a powerful narrative and sentiment booster, but is likely inadequate to mitigate the unlock climate. Supplementing the real yield with treasury ARB is likely necessary to act as a shield for supply dilution.</p>\n<p>The most difficult aspect of this exercise will be finding the optimal amount of ARB to offset ARB dilution. Dedicating treasury resources to improving the token holder climate offers concrete benefits to the DAO; it offers a more sustainable habitat for long-term holders and prevents the need to liquidate ARB to front-run unlocks. This will support ARB price and mitigate the issue of decreasing ARB price and reduced purchasing power for DAO spending.</p>\n<p>2.9B ARB are remaining of team and investor unlocks. Theoretically, Arbitrum could dedicate almost the entirety of its 3.1B treasury ARB to offset ARB unlocks. This exaggerated example would deplete over 90% of treasury ARB resources, but it’s a helpful way to frame the optimization problem that faces the DAO. In order to improve sentiment around the ARB token, a material portion of the ARB treasury will be necessary. In addition, providing clarity around the timing and use of future DAO spend could prevent the market from lumping it in with unlocks.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57008-staking-program-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57008-staking-program-6\"></a>Staking Program</h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum Staking program should be designed to incentivize delegation while also ensuring delegates are active, as the DAO suffers from a lack of participation amongst delegates. We believe rewarding delegates who are active in governance is the best approach. However, systems currently in place do this but have not been successful in ensuring delegates’ votes.</p>\n<p>Users’ stake’ their ARB by delegating to themselves or a third-party delegate.</p>\n<p>Rewards can be distributed in weekly epochs with a split of 90:10 between delegators and delegates.</p>\n<p>If a delegate fails to vote on all of the proposals that week, they and their delegates should not receive ARB rewards for that week. This incentivizes active delegation and ensures delegators are careful whom they delegate their ARB to.</p>\n<p>The program should be incentivized with X% of the Sequencer, Orbit fees, and Timeboost revenue.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Timeboost proposal offers two options for the proceeds of the revenue generated:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Collect the proceeds in ETH and send them to the DAO.</li>\n<li>Collect the proceeds in ARB and send them to the burn address.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We propose a third option: collect the proceeds in ARB and distribute to stakers.</p>\n<p>Burning the ARB collected from Timeboost misaligns incentives between long-term and short-term ARB holders. Instead of reducing the ARB supply, the DAO should focus on putting ARB tokens in the hands of holders who are aligned with Arbitrum’s long-term mission. This is likely to be the holders delegating and the delegates.</p>\n<p>The revenue generated from the sequencer and Orbit fees is not consequential enough to justify being the only sources of revenue directed to the staking program. Therefore, we believe it is in the best interest of the DAO to direct Timeboost revenue to the staking program as well.</p>\n<p>All revenue should either be collected as ARB or ETH and swapped into ARB to distribute to stakers.</p>\n<p>This is because distributing as a buyback will be net positive for ARB’s price performance and help reduce regulatory risks associated with distributing in-kind.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57008-supplementary-reward-approaches-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57008-supplementary-reward-approaches-7\"></a>Supplementary reward approaches</h3>\n<p>Standard, flat - A standard X ARB distributed to stakers over X months approach is safe, easily digestible, and potentially effective. ARB staking rewards from the DAO partially offset ARB unlocks. ARB stakers effectively maintain a greater portion of their share of total network ownership than non-stakers and receive tangible upside in network traction through real yield. The risk with this approach is that it is not sufficiently differentiated from other models. With at least 1.2B /year hitting the market, Arbitrum may not want to dedicate a large amount of ARB to offset 25% of the unlocks for the market to just not care because the situation is still suboptimal.</p>\n<p>Linear decay - A front-loaded strategy offers a no-nonsense approach to the current ARB price action and provides a path to sunsetting for real yield. This approach would somewhat mirror Optimism’s approach, whereby RPGF rounds are funded with OP, before tapering off in favor of sequencer fees.</p>\n<p>For example, 20% of treasury ARB (60M) is dedicated to the program, with 35M in the first year, 15M in year 2, and 10M in year 3. ARB rewards would materially offset dilution immediately, tapering off while real yield increases.</p>\n<p>One drawback of this approach is ARB hitting circulating supply accelerates in the short term. However, holding ARB will become much more attractive for long-term stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Linear growth - Yet another option could involve scaling up ARB emissions as more ARB hit the market. This would allow ARB staking rewards to keep pace with an expanding circulating supply in the months to come. The issue here is that ARB staking will be resource-intensive later on when, ideally, alternative income streams are up and running. ARB staking will also be less impactful on a token-for-token basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Standard flat, safe option for supplementary ARB rewards may be the best fit if the DAO is willing to dedicate a substantial portion of the treasury (25-30%) to the staking program over the next few years. If the DAO prefers to spend less on the staking program, the linear decay approach may work better in order to allow for strategy on behalf of the user to make the opportunity worthwhile. Using a front loaded 15% of treasury arb for staking rewards could give similar benefits to the prior option in the short run.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum should seriously consider a strong investment into the supplementary staking rewards. Prior snapshot concluded 100M (3%) of the budget, more of the unlocks. Holding ARB is unattractive, and this dynamic has harmful repercussions to DAO operations and in the community. Arbitrum has a healthy supply of ARB in the treasury, and should consider deploying it while it is most effective.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/follow-up-dao-income-sources-and-the-path-to-staking/26447\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/follow-up-dao-income-sources-and-the-path-to-staking/26447","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Aug 2024 14:30:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26447"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/follow-up-dao-income-sources-and-the-path-to-staking/26447.rss","#text":"Follow Up -- DAO Income Sources and The Path to Staking"},"filter":false},{"title":"Protector Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"commons17119","category":"Delegate Statements","description":"<p>This is Protector’s delegate communication thread.</p>\n<p>Delegate Name: Protector<br>\nDelegate Address: 0x6F1c94D507B875E28b93965822A72bbaE6720e81</p>\n<p>We only exercise our vote in opposition.</p>\n<p>We are a governance team of three.When there is one or fewer dissenting votes, we abstain.

Executive Summary</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56960-background-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56960-background-3\"></a>Background</h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (”ADPC”), composed of Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal, is coming to the end of its first phase on August 20, 2024. As such, this proposal aims to extend the ADPC’s tenure into Phase II for a 6-month period, which will commence on the date on which the Tally vote for this proposal is executed on-chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56960-outcome-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56960-outcome-4\"></a>Outcome</h3>\n<p>The ADPC’s pilot phase proceeded successfully, with significant outcomes to Arbitrum DAO and a range of key learnings for the committee. Creating a comprehensive procurement process from the ground up to ensure that Arbitrum is seen as a leader not only in the technical sphere but also within decentralized governance has been a great opportunity.</p>\n<p>We laid the foundation for the ADPC to be an effective set-up bringing the benefits of well-structured procurement to Arbitrum DAO. Cost savings will result from the creation and use of procurement frameworks and marketplaces developed by the ADPC uniquely for Arbitrum DAO as well as the necessary legal and operational infrastructure and strategic sourcing methodology.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56960-way-ahead-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56960-way-ahead-5\"></a>Way Ahead</h3>\n<p>The ADPC’s initial phase was conducted as a proof of concept demonstrating the capability of the team and the benefits arising from the strategic use of advanced sourcing methodology. The ADPC proposes to build on these successes into Phase II of the ADPC’s engagement. In this Phase II, the ADPC, after careful alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO, proposes to work on all of the following work packages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Work Package 1: Procurement for [2] tactical verticals</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Vertical 1 will be focused on procuring RPC providers for projects building in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This decision is based on engagement with delegates and stakeholders as well as an understanding of the core services required by all projects looking to build in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal. Please note that the ADPC will not request any funding for its events services procurement in that separate proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The scope within the 6-month term is to develop evaluation criteria, draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP/tender), evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s. Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in the scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those internal legal processes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Further details on our process for arriving at these shortlisted verticals can be found below in the section on Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Work Package 2:</strong> Continued management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services and, based on the success of the first cohort, publishing the proposal for an extension of the fund.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Work Package 3</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Definition and creation of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget for the Arbitrum DAO, to be custodied by the Multi-Signature Safe (MSS), and allocated towards the utilisation of service providers as whitelisted by the ADPC. This creates a utilisation rail for the DAO to be able to utilise the services of the whitelisted service providers procured by the ADPC. Without this in place, the DAO is unable to utilise these service providers without the full proposal process (Forum, Snapshot, On-Chain).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ADPC will draft and propose the OpEx proposal to the DAO;  further details, including the process and procedure for utilization of the OpEx budget by the DAO, will be outlined in this seperate proposal to the DAO. This seperate proposal will contain multiple options for the size of the OpEx budget for the community to vote on.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Work Package 4</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Creating a Phase II Outcome Report, similar to the one we have <a href=\"https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">published</a> for Phase I, and submitting it to the DAO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continued alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO on the evolution of the Arbitrum DAO’s structure, and ensuring that the ADPC fits into any structure that is defined (e.g., OpCo).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ad-hoc tasks, e.g., aligning and connecting whitelisted service providers with existing and incoming projects on Arbitrum, existing and incoming DAO proposals, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Optional Additional Verticals:</strong> On completion of Work Package 1 and subject to (i) DAO demand and (ii) capacity of the ADPC at that point, procurement for up to [2] additional verticals on request from the DAO after approval by the DAO governance process. Where the procurement for such additional verticals is likely to require an extension to the ADPC term, this Work Package will be contingent on that renewal being granted by the DAO to avoid partial completion of tasks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The overall budget for the 6-month term will be USD 414,000 including OpEx, details on which can be found below in the Budget &amp; Methodology section. It will be paid in six monthly instalments in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective calendar month. The Funding Request from the on-chain vote will be  907,457 ARB based on the time weighted average ARB price of $<strong>0.547464135</strong>/ARB as further outlined below. A buffer has been added so that, in the case of ARB depreciation, the ADPC multi-sig is still able to satisfy payments to the ADPC’s members. Unutilized ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury.</p>\n<p>The multi-sig requested to manage the funds will be within the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)</a> established by Entropy Advisors.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56960-acknowledgements-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56960-acknowledgements-6\"></a><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></h3>\n<p>We would like to acknowledge the consistent participation and deep input from the Arbitrum community, delegates, and stakeholders, without whom our progress would not have been possible.

Background of the ADPC</h1>\n<p>The ADPC was established as a crucial component of the Arbitrum ecosystem’s governance structure, following a successful proposal and subsequent community vote in early 2024. The formation of the ADPC was driven by the growing need for a structured, transparent, and efficient approach to procurement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the ecosystem’s growth, security, and sustainability.</p>\n<p>The inception of the ADPC can be traced back to discussions within the Arbitrum community about the challenges faced by projects building on the protocol, particularly in securing high-quality service providers. These discussions highlighted the need for a pre-emptive quality assurance mechanism that could benefit the entire ecosystem. Against the background that a dedicated procurement framework has, to our knowledge, not been established in any DAO prior, the committee’s formation marked a pivotal moment not only in Arbitrum’s governance evolution, but set a precedent for DAOs in general. We designed the ADPC to address immediate needs and to create a foundation for future growth and efficiency in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Phase I of the ADPC ran for a duration of 182 days from February 21, 2024 (i.e., the day that the KYB for the ADPC members was completed) until August 20, 2024.</p>\n<p>The ADPC’s mandate in Phase I consisted of the following:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56960-a-oversight-of-security-oriented-service-providers-framework-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56960-a-oversight-of-security-oriented-service-providers-framework-8\"></a><strong>A.

Key points included the introduction of Orbit chains, which allow teams to build their own blockchains with customization options. The Arbitrum DAO requires a 10% net revenue contribution from Orbit chains, with 8% going to the DAO Treasury and 2% to a developer guild. Over 60 Orbit chains are publicly announced, with over 100 in development. The discussion highlighted the need for community building, incentives, and infrastructure support. The DAO was encouraged to help amplify the Orbit vision and support cohesive marketing efforts to compete with the “Super Chain” narrative.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56956-speakers-and-participants-3\"

href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ArbOS 31 “Bianca”</a> onchain vote on Tally has passed quorum, signaling the DAO’s approval to activate Arbitrum Stylus on Arbitrum One and Nova. To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time “Stylus Sprint” program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks and the program will run for 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign’s primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.</p>\n<p>Interested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Today, the Stylus ecosystem is promising but very nascent. At launch, the developer experience will be in its early stages, offering an opportunity for pioneers to shape and refine Stylus as they build with it. Teams building with Stylus today are early adopters of the technology and are pushing the limits of what is possible on the EVM.</p>\n<p>The “Stylus Sprint” is strategically designed to accelerate the adoption of Stylus and help drive visibility into Stylus’ transformative potential to the broader crypto community. Launched in conjunction with Bianca passing, this program aims to strengthen the momentum of the upgrade, drawing significant adoption and attention to the technological advancements it introduces.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts/22970\">Stylus</a> represents a pivotal innovation for the entire Ethereum ecosystem, setting Arbitrum apart from other platforms by enabling the use of multiple programming languages for smart contracts. This not only enhances the efficiency and capabilities of Arbitrum applications but also broadens the accessibility of Arbitrum’s ecosystem to a more diverse group of developers. By supporting smart contracts written in languages such as Rust, C, and C++, Stylus expands the scope of possible applications, unlocking untapped use cases for end users and making Arbitrum a more versatile and attractive platform for developers. This capability represents a tangible competitive advantage for Arbitrum, and it is crucial that this differentiator is prominently showcased via its use in high-value developments.</p>\n<p>The “Stylus Sprint” will provide financial incentives to encourage the development of high-quality projects. This support aims to attract top-tier developers from within the Arbitrum, EVM, and Rust communities, targeting teams new to Arbitrum that can only realize their ideas with Stylus, existing Arbitrum projects with complex computation for migration, and developers from other WASM ecosystems (e.g., Solana Rust Devs), fostering a diverse range of applications. By demonstrating the practical benefits and performance enhancements Stylus offers, the program seeks to establish a robust portfolio of Stylus-based contracts, helping solidify Arbitrum’s position as a leader in the rollup race. The Sprint will also empower developers to create building blocks for a wide variety of projects building on Arbitrum such as reference contracts, Rust libraries, testing/development frameworks, and SDK contributions. Reference tooling and code are crucial to any development-based ecosystem’s staying power.</p>\n<p>The Stylus Sprint aims to create a ripple effect of innovation and adoption, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and capable Arbitrum ecosystem for developers, users, and token holders.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-rationale-and-goals-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-rationale-and-goals-4\"></a>Rationale and Goals</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Demonstrate the efficiency of, and untapped possibilities with, Stylus by showing how teams can build never-before-built protocols on Arbitrum and take advantage of Stylus’ efficiency and compute advantages.</li>\n<li>Support network growth and accelerate the distribution of capital to both EVM and non-EVM protocols that migrate to Stylus to further drive network and ecosystem growth. This includes infrastructure as well as applications.</li>\n<li>Attract top protocols from other ecosystems drawn by Stylus’ efficiency gains and multi-language support, which in turn will bring their user bases, increasing overall activity and transaction volume on the network.</li>\n<li>Implement a strategy to distribute grants over extended periods and in alignment with the achievement of key milestones. This approach aims to cultivate enduring relationships with protocols and ensure sustained development and engagement.</li>\n<li>Position Arbitrum as the most accessible, efficient, and powerful EVM-compatible ecosystem to build in.</li>\n<li>Provide ample resources, support, and incentives to developers utilizing Stylus, fostering robust projects and vibrant communities. This will drive the long-term growth and success of Arbitrum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-application-process-rfp-details-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-application-process-rfp-details-6\"></a>Application Process &amp; RFP Details:</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.</p>\n<p>For the open-application track, non-exhaustive categories may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New developer-focused infrastructure or extensions of existing developer-focused infrastructure to improve the arsenal of tools available to Stylus builders;</li>\n<li>New applications that feature untapped use cases only made possible via Stylus, on Arbitrum One or new app chains using Stylus on Orbit chains;</li>\n<li>External WebAssembly (WASM) application or chain migrations (from ecosystems that use Rust for their smart contracts);</li>\n<li>Existing EVM application migrations from Solidity to Rust (e.g., an app rewriting a portion of their code using Stylus).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the RFP track, the committee is excited to hear proposals from teams working on developing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tooling to add support for new languages with Stylus to expand the reach and adoption of Stylus among developers. This can include new SDKs, EVM-tooling specific to the new language, and/or reference implementations and libraries for the new language. To get inspired for what languages might be interesting to see support get added for:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.assemblyscript.org/introduction.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">AssemblyScript</a> - a Typescript-based programming language optimized for, and statically compiled down to, WASM. Typescript is a widely used programming language, with 38.5% of all developers claiming to have used or currently use Typescript, compared to 12.6% for Rust <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">according to Statista</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://move-language.github.io/move/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Move</a> - a resource-oriented, strongly typed programming language that offers built-in support for formal verification of code correctness. Originally developed by Meta for their Libra/Diem stablecoin, this language has gained popularity among emergent L1s like Flow, Aptos, and Sui. Adding Move support to Stylus and by extension the EVM opens the opportunity for Move-based applications to tap into the already-massive Arbitrum ecosystem and the liquidity layer of Ethereum.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A GUI for developers to inspect and interact with the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-cache-manager\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stylus cache manager</a> on Arbitrum One. Extra consideration will be given to teams who make such a service/instance self-hostable to unlock widespread adoption and use among Stylus Orbit chains. Example user journeys that can be covered are:\n<ul>\n<li>How a developer inspects the contents of the cache;</li>\n<li>How a developer gets the minimum bid price before bidding;</li>\n<li>How a developer makes a bid for their contract to join the cache;</li>\n<li>How a developer views the position of their contract within the cache, and/or;</li>\n<li>How a developer can subscribe to events or changes to the cache as it pertains to their contract(s).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A Solidity-to-WASM compiler to reduce the migration cost (for existing applications) of moving over to WASM. This in turn aims to help current Solidity projects reap the benefits of a more secure and performant WASM VM sooner and with less upfront work.</li>\n<li>General improvements to the current debugging workflow and developer experience for Stylus applications and Orbit chain developers. This can include compatibility enhancements and Stylus-specific improvements to how GDB is currently used to debug Stylus applications, or the introduction/integration of new tooling to elevate the UX of Stylus contract debugging.</li>\n<li>General enhancements and/or extensions to the existing Stylus Rust SDK, the cargo-stylus command line tool, and/or the WASM VM within Arbitrum Nitro itself.</li>\n<li>Stylus-specific education and developer relations materials to onboard the next generation of Web3 developers.</li>\n<li>Tools and frameworks to demonstratively help <a href=\"https://cosmwasm.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CosmWASM</a> and Solana projects (as examples) to migrate to Arbitrum chains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.</p>\n<p>Teams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-evaluation-committee-and-committee-advisors-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-evaluation-committee-and-committee-advisors-7\"></a>Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors</h3>\n<p>To effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Additionally, a group of advisors will provide consultative support to the committee, although the advisors will not possess decision-making authority. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far. Currently, there are limited experts qualified to assess Stylus applications effectively. However, should the DAO prefer to engage in a broader selection process that we believe would be inefficient and lead to a less successful program, Entropy Advisors is more than happy to facilitate an RFP process instead, contingent upon a DAO vote to define and appoint these roles.</p>\n<p>Evaluation Committee</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Derek Lee - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)</li>\n<li>Chris Cordle - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)</li>\n<li>Srinjoy Chakraborty - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)</li>\n<li>Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)</li>\n<li>Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)</li>\n<li>Matt Hamilton - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Committee Advisors</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Committee Advisors’ main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible. <strong>Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.</strong></p>\n<p>Judges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 2 months will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects. <strong>Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future.</strong> In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-recommended-application-structure-and-framing-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-recommended-application-structure-and-framing-8\"></a>Recommended Application Structure and Framing</h3>\n<p>Applications for the program will be rigorously evaluated based on a set of clearly defined criteria. To ensure a thorough assessment, grantees are encouraged to provide detailed information about their plans and objectives for the grant. Each application should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What their plans are to grow their protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem;</li>\n<li>How closely the team’s mission aligns with those of Arbitrum;</li>\n<li>Whether or not they clearly demonstrate how they will utilize Stylus;</li>\n<li>An appropriate spending plan for how the grant will be used;</li>\n<li>A reasonable development plan and timeline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Judges and advisors may also consider other relevant metrics tailored to the specifics of each application. These could include innovation potential, the experience of the team, market readiness, user engagement strategies, or any other factors deemed relevant.</p>\n<p>The recommendations above are designed to ensure that the selected projects are coming to the committee with a high-quality plan and to ensure that the application ideas are not only viable, but also poised to make significant contributions to the Arbitrum ecosystem. By adhering to this application structure, the evaluation process aims to foster transparency, fairness, and alignment with the strategic objectives of the Arbitrum network. The judges and advisors will work together to create the application and evaluation criteria. We envision the entire process taking place in the forum, though we will explore pricing around hosting it on Questbook instead.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-application-evaluation-criteria-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-application-evaluation-criteria-9\"></a>Application Evaluation Criteria</h3>\n<p>While we strongly believe each application will be unique and should therefore be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, a baseline framework and evaluation criteria are outlined below to give teams a feel for what to keep in mind when applying and building.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Evaluation Committee will be on the lookout for, and prioritize evaluating applications, that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can scale, or help scale</strong>, Stylus usage over the long run. Examples include tooling and frameworks that can be extended, built upon, and leveraged by many teams all at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Contribute to the young, but growing, ecosystem of Stylus tooling and infrastructure</strong>, rather than direct contributions to individual Stylus applications and Stylus Orbit chains.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on projects that aim to be self-sustainable in the medium to long term</strong>, rather than one-off projects that can only exist/survive for the short duration of the program.</li>\n<li><strong>Directly highlight core Stylus benefits and strengths with excellent creativity</strong>, including the efficient use of computational and storage resources or security primitives that Stylus bolsters and shines at.</li>\n<li><strong>Fill a specific, unique niche in the market</strong>, as opposed to re-implementing an existing application, tool, or chain in Stylus for the sake of using Stylus (and not the other purported benefits one gets with Stylus).</li>\n<li><strong>Come from outside the Arbitrum and/or Ethereum ecosystem</strong> to effectively “grow the pie” of Web3 projects and users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that applications may be rejected for a variety of reasons as there are a limited number of resources to allocate to a near-infinite pool of great ideas/applicants that can emerge. Out of scope are projects that are already being funded by the ArbitrumDAO, Offchain Labs, or the Arbitrum Foundation, or are otherwise nearing completion by the time this program’s evaluation period ends. Examples of this include the development of the Stylus Rust SDK that is already being scoped out and developed by Offchain Labs.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-multisig-setup-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-multisig-setup-10\"></a>Multisig Setup</h3>\n<p>The Stylus Sprint multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program and 150K ARB for payments to judges. Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56933-funding-levels-and-disbursement-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-funding-levels-and-disbursement-11\"></a>Funding Levels and Disbursement</h3>\n<p>Teams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K, 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones.</p>\n<p>Unallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don’t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.</p>\n<p>Funding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. 50% of funds will be distributed after deployment to encourage teams to think about growth and sustainability post-launch. The criteria for these 2 checkpoints will be proposed by teams in their applications.</p>\n<p>Milestone distribution will function as the following are achieved:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>10% - Planning</strong> + Building: Creation of a Development Plan, Architecture Design, Prototyping, Implementation, Optimization.</li>\n<li><strong>30% - Deployment</strong>: Testing, Auditing, Deployment. *Projects will be eligible but not guaranteed admission into the subsidy program per the ADPC</li>\n<li><strong>25% - Checkpoint 1</strong></li>\n<li><strong>25% - Checkpoint 2</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>All projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. The above milestone structure, however, is not required. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above. The evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-grant-eligibility-requirements-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-grant-eligibility-requirements-12\"></a>Grant Eligibility Requirements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Grantees must participate in a case study that highlights their Stylus development experience</li>\n<li>Grantees must build their projects open source, but not necessarily free to use. Free to use however will be a factor in the evaluation committee criteria.</li>\n<li>Grantees must participate in co-marketing activities to promote their protocol and Stylus.</li>\n<li>Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.</li>\n<li>Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to judge progress.</li>\n<li>Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.</li>\n<li>Grantees must not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.</li>\n<li>Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.</li>\n<li>Grantees must apply using the approved program application template.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-timeline-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-timeline-13\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Stylus Sprint Forum Post - August 20, 2024</li>\n<li>Snapshot Vote Begins - August 29, 2024</li>\n<li>On-Chain Vote - Sept 12, 2024</li>\n<li>Stylus Sprint Begins - Oct 4, 2024</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The program will begin on the Monday following the onchain proposal’s passing.

Feedback between the Evaluation Committee and applicants will be conducted on an ongoing/continuous basis over the next 10 weeks. KYC with the foundation will then begin and first milestone payments may be allocated upon completion. The MSS chairs, Arbitrum Foundation, and Entropy Advisors will need to work closely to ensure a strict payment process.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56933-overall-cost-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56933-overall-cost-14\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p><strong>5,150,000 ARB</strong></p>\n<p>Up to 5M to be awarded to projects building on Stylus</p>\n<p>75,000 ARB payment in total over 14.5 months per committee member for 2 committee members = 150,000 ARB</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-fund-the-stylus-sprint/26437\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-fund-the-stylus-sprint/26437","pubDate":"Tue, 20 Aug 2024 16:34:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26437"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-fund-the-stylus-sprint/26437.rss","#text":"[RFC] Fund The Stylus Sprint"},"filter":false},{"title":"Arbitrum DAO - Monthly Token Flow Report - Genesis to July 2024","dc:creator":"r3gen_Finance","category":"DAO Finances","description":"<p>This category is for the Arbitrum DAO’s monthly token flow report.

Complexities</h1>\n<p>Being a first-mover in setting up procurement frameworks in the DAO space presented unique challenges, as we could not build on top of precedents but had to develop everything from the ground up. While this presented obstacles, it also provided opportunities for innovation and setting new standards in decentralized procurement.</p>\n\nVI.1 Legal and Compliance <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adpc-outcome-report-for-phase-i/26433/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nVI.2 Document Retention and IP Management <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adpc-outcome-report-for-phase-i/26433/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nVI.3 Alignment with Arbitrum Foundation <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adpc-outcome-report-for-phase-i/26433/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n\nVI.4 Resource and Time Constraints <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adpc-outcome-report-for-phase-i/26433/1\">(click for more details)</a>\n<h1><a name=\"p-56897-vii-key-learnings-and-recommendations-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56897-vii-key-learnings-and-recommendations-8\"></a>VII. Key Learnings and Recommendations</h1>\n<p>Drawing from our experience during the ADPC’s first term, we have identified several key learnings and translated them into recommendations for future terms. These insights will not only enhance the ADPC’s ability to deliver greater value to the DAO but also serve as a valuable resource for other DAO committees with external exposure. Given the amount and, in individual cases, complexities in implementing those learnings, the implementation process will start in Phase II and be completed over time through following terms. We will outline in future outcome reports to what extent individual learnings and recommendations have been implemented.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56897-vii1-operational-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56897-vii1-operational-9\"></a>VII.1 Operational</h2>\n<p>The ADPC’s initial term has provided invaluable insights into the operational requirements for effectively managing procurement processes within a DAO ecosystem.

Outlook</h1>\n<p>As the ADPC’s initial term nears its conclusion, we are excited to share our outlook for the future and the key initiatives we propose to undertake in the next term. The details of these plans will be comprehensively outlined in the ADPC’s extension proposal, which will be published shortly. This section aims to provide a high-level overview of the work in progress in regards to the extension.</p>\n<p>In this Phase II, the ADPC, after careful alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO, will propose to work in particular on the following:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56897-procurement-for-two-tactical-verticals-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56897-procurement-for-two-tactical-verticals-15\"></a><strong>Procurement for two tactical verticals</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Vertical 1 will be focused on procuring RPC providers for projects building in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This decision is based on engagement with delegates and stakeholders as well as an understanding of the core services required by all projects looking to build in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Vertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal.</li>\n<li>The scope within the 6-month term is to develop evaluation criteria, draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP/tender), evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s. Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in the scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those internal legal processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56897-subsidy-fund-for-security-services-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56897-subsidy-fund-for-security-services-16\"></a>Subsidy Fund for Security Services</h3>\n<p>We will continue the management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-56897-operational-expense-budget-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56897-operational-expense-budget-17\"></a>Operational Expense Budget</h3>\n<p>Definition of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget for the Arbitrum DAO, allocated towards the utilisation of service providers as whitelisted by the ADPC.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-56897-ix-appendices-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56897-ix-appendices-18\"></a>IX.

The conference is been organized by <a href=\"https://www.web3bridgeafrica.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">web3 Bridge</a> - “a tech company and community that focuses on training blockchain developers and web2 developers, fostering collaboration between the two sectors”.</p>\n<p>This is a long shot but it bares repeating that the web3 Lagos conference is arguably one of the largest web3 focused conference in Africa. Bringing in over 1,000 developers from across major cities in Africa (and outside of Africa) for the three days of conference that will shape the course of Ethereum and the larger web3 ecosystem.</p>\n<p>I intend to host (with a team of dedicated smart contracts developers, should this proposal pass) Arbitrum focused IRL workshops at the conference as this will give Arbitrum a strong presence (and the growth of Arbitrum ecosystem within Africa) at one of the largest web3 conference in Africa.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the second paragraph above, this is a long shot, putting into consideration the time constraints. And so a speedy resolution is needed on this proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>Very few web3 conferences can bring in attendees from across major cities in Africa. This year’s edition will be the 3rd edition and the conference have had an average attendance of 1,000 people per <a href=\"https://event.web3bridge.com/insight\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">information available via the web3 Lagos conference website</a>.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://x.com/charliecodes/status/1694302536130310601\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">spoke at the web3 Lagos conference 2.0 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/Web3Bridge/status/1694290199142973782\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the announcement tweet from web3 Bridge</a>.</p>\n<p>And I attended the workshop by <a href=\"https://x.com/Mars_Energy/status/1696866956710686763\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the Ethereum Foundation</a> at the web3 Lagos conference 2.0 on running Ethereum nodes - prior to this time, not so many Africans particularly in Nigeria were running Ethereum nodes. The result after the Ethereum nodes works, led to some people picking up interest in running nodes.</p>\n<p>We can adopt the same strategy of hosting a side workshop on Arbitrum, leading to the attendees to building on the Arbitrum chain, contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem, introduce attendees to Arbitrum initiatives and the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p>This will lead to a significant growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>As at the time of this proposal, there are no talks or workshops on Arbitrum at the upcoming web3 Lagos conference 3.0 with a current reservations for the conference is at 1148. <a href=\"https://event.web3bridge.com/insight\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">See conference website here</a>.</p>\n<p>I think we can take advantage of this conference to strategically position Arbitrum within the African blockchain developers space.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>The growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem can not be separated from proactively getting involved in web3 communities. And through the years, the team at web3 Bridge have consistently onboarded developers to smart contract developers into the larger web3 ecosystem through their co-hort-based intensive trainings.</p>\n<p>The web3 Lagos conference provides us the opportunity to actually engage core smart contract developers into the Arbitrum ecosystem within the African continent.</p>\n<p>The web3 Lagos conference have some <a href=\"https://event.web3bridge.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sponsors like the Ethereum Support Program, Lisk, Stellar</a>.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum can gain not just brand visibility but also bring in more developers into the ecosystem via this conference.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<p>The Arbitrum workshop is proposed to run for two days as a side event at the conference.</p>\n<p>Day 1</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A look at the Arbitrum ecosystem and beyond</li>\n<li>cover all things on building smart contracts on Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Writing Solidity Smart Contracts for Arbitrum</li>\n<li>We will use the Arbitrum docs as a reference</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Day 2</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Deploying Smart Contracts to Arbitrum Testnet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Arbitrum Stylus</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A member of the Arbitrum DAO or foundation can join to give a talk virtually since the timing for an onsite trip is very short.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Future of Arbitrum</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTE: I am open to more topics and/or suggestions on what the DAO deem fit to be covered at the workshop should this proposal pass.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></p>\n<p>Upon approval of this proposal, we will use a 2/3 multisig address to receive the funding. The funds requested will be used to host and supporting the workshop, pay for sponsorship to the conference organizers (I had a conversation with the host and are getting a discounted rate sponsorship rate of $3,000 which is a big win for us - giving us access to set up an Arbitrum booth for the three days of the conference and the two day workshop).</p>\n<p>Multisig address: arb1:0xb5323C93B11a9A3c3522eFf617dDDfA6d57597f1</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>\n<p>The event is scheduled for September 5 to September 7, 2024 in Lagos Nigeria.

The ODE is an advanced tool for delegates seeking greater alignment with each other and their delegators. As a tool for DAOs, ODE will enable streamlined working group and multisig formation, allowing our top-level delegates to self-govern with increasing legitimacy.</p>\n<p>This new tool consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A smart contract registry (<a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xca455e314326fd19c80887d1de67fb7721bf3d7d#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3732762eef3a500aa706a5fba6ee464d663ec9b2#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">2</a>)</li>\n<li>An API (<a href=\"https://forseapp.notion.site/Oxcart-API-Documentation-b20a91886d564be1ac5f720f2893bc77\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">3</a>)</li>\n<li>A dashboard (<a href=\"https://dashboard.forse.io/oxcart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">4</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the first experiment on Arbitrum we have made this new tool available to the top 100 delegates by voting power (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hp5qUu85rOMaADOzbRgJrosmiMSem3nzZMy3OrALAO0/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">5</a>). The selection of a trusted backup delegate is the only information required to participate, and this can be changed at any time. Delegates will record these selections on-chain via the dashboard, and an API is provided for builders and researchers.</p>\n<p>At the early phases we have two primary research goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Determine how meta-delegate support affirms or diverges from active participant voting.</li>\n<li>Determine how access to a meta-delegation dashboard impacts delegate and tokenholder activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And two primary action items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resource delegates toward increased connection with:\n<ul>\n<li>each other (alignment);</li>\n<li>constituencies (leadership and service), and;</li>\n<li>DAO governance operations (efficacy).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Recommend metrics and methodologies based on the new system that may reduce voter fatigue while increasing legitimacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Longer-term we hope to determine how introducing intra-delegate support metrics at various stages of the governance process may increase overall efficacy and legitimacy.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56877-for-delegates-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56877-for-delegates-3\"></a>For Delegates</h2>\n<h1><a name=\"p-56877-register-here-httpsdashboardforseiooxcart-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56877-register-here-httpsdashboardforseiooxcart-4\"></a><a href=\"https://dashboard.forse.io/oxcart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> → REGISTER HERE ← </a></h1>\n<p>Our goal is participation by all delegates as future experiments will include those that register in this round. This round, one ARB 12,000 reward will be given to one participant, randomly selected at the end of the registration period at approximately 2024-08-23 12PM, or at precisely blockheight 20590515.

The daoURI, following EIP-4824, will create a single source of truth on the DAO, that cannot be altered by external agencies, is fully manageable via governance, bringing helpful context on the DAO onchain. This will be helpful for newcomers, tooling providers, and experienced governooors alike.</p>\n<p><strong>Adopting EIP-4824 requires no additional spend from the DAO treasury, and it makes no change to its smart contracts or governance structure.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>EIP-4824 is a DAO metadata standard, akin to ERC-721 for NFTs. It has already been adopted by Snapshot, Aragon, Treasure, 1inch, Optimism Collective (through the Optimism Foundation), and multiple frameworks and DAOs. The adoption efforts are supported through grants from the Ethereum Foundation, Optimism Collective, ENS, Gnosis, Solana and many other stakeholders of the web3 ecosystem.</p>\n<p>DAOstar is also an Arbitrum Foundation grantee. The grant aims to improve the adoption of EIP-4824 within the Arbitrum ecosystem. We are allocating a portion of that grant to steward this proposal, and are requesting no additional funds from the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO is one of the largest DAOs. It has one of the most active governances, in terms of number participants as well as community-led initiatives. All of this activity, along with the scale and complexity of the Arbitrum DAO breeds a lot of metadata. This dataset grows with every new initiative and has multiple components that may not be very visible from the “outside”. For example, consider the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who are the current Security Council, Arbitrum Research &amp; Development Collective, Procurement Committee members? (Answer: you can search the respective forum post to find this)</li>\n<li>Can you share a location that tracks all DAO-owned/managed multisig addresses? (Answer: this could be <a href=\"https://www.arbwallets.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.arbwallets.xyz/ </a>)</li>\n<li>Can you share a status update on the DAO’s grant spending? (Answer: R3gen Finance reports this on the forum)</li>\n<li>Where can we see delegate performance? (Answer: KarmaGAP or Tally)</li>\n<li>How much in sequencer fees is being collected? (Answer: there is a dashboard for this)</li>\n<li>What orbit chains exist? (Answer: the ecosystem page tracks this)</li>\n<li>Where to find recordings and transcripts of public meetings? (Answer: I’m not sure!)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For an active participant, these answers might not be very hard to find. But for the majority of people who are not active participants of the DAO, and even for tooling providers, collecting this information requires a painstaking amount of manual effort. This leads to inconsistencies, errors and outdated information.</p>\n<p>The same concern echoes over the entire DAO ecosystem. There are over 200 DAOs at the moment with a treasury size of over $1M, and collecting information on them manually is becoming an exponentially difficult task. EIP-4824 was authored by DAOstar with the support from the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Etherscan, DeepDAO, Snapshot, and a large number of DAO tooling companies, to create a better infrastructure for DAO data.</p>\n<p>Adopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. daoURIs have a standard JSON-LD format:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">{\n\"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n\"type\": \"DAO\",\n\"name\": \"&lt;name of the DAO&gt;\",\n\"description\": \"&lt;description&gt;\",\n\"membersURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"proposalsURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"activityLogURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"governanceURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"contractsRegistryURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It contains information on governance, members, activities and contracts by default. Outside of the endpoints mentioned above, a DAO can also choose to publish information that is specifically important to it. For Arbitrum, this could be information about orbit chains, different multi-sigs and councils, spending, sequencer fees, link to its constitution, etc. Essentially, <strong>the daoURI creates an “official repository” of information on the DAO.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some examples of how the daoURI could be used:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It can be used to bring more context to contracts on block explorers. For example, we could go from this:</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1QMspHKChbZaAlnUGWXZNp0rCKK.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_690x365.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1QMspHKChbZaAlnUGWXZNp0rCKK\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_690x365.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_1035x547.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_1380x730.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F8FA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>to this:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sIqiG4h9JSjvKbsmjRAawo9gqyc.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_690x363.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"sIqiG4h9JSjvKbsmjRAawo9gqyc\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_690x363.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_1035x544.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_1380x726.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F1F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>We can make DAO data easily and freely available to everyone</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, Arbitrum DAO’s current DeepDAO profile misses a ton of info - contracts, or revenue, or governance guardrails (councils and multi-sigs), etc. Messari’s Arbitrum DAO dashboard requires a paid membership to access, which could also be due to the difficulty of collecting and presenting DAO data (thus making it too valuable to give away for free).

This takes away a lot of available information. If we wanted to change this, we could achieve it easily by enforcing a discussionURI field inside the proposalURI (which is a standard component of daoURI). Tally, Aragon, Snapshot X, and most governance tooling providers are members of DAOstar. Extending the standard will create an easy upgrade pathway for them and this change would reflect the change across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>To summarize, a daoURI creates a source of truth that is easily accessible by onchain and offchain tools. This proposal carries no additional cost, or changes to any existing smart contract or process. It’s a step in the right direction with no downside.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned above, adopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain.

The registration will be on Arbitrum One network, setting the DAO’s governor timelock as admin, and a manager as the DAO decides. This would require a constitutional proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set a new ‘daoURI’ txt record on arbitrumfoundation.eth. Arbitrum Foundation will have complete edit access to this daoURI as they own arbitrumfoundation.eth. A daoURI published through this method will not be editable via an onchain vote. However, this method is in some sense easier than the previous, and it requires no onchain vote. This would be a non-constitutional proposal. When the time comes, the DAO can also adopt EIP-4824 through method 1 to have full control over its data.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Transactions for reference: <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/88514909609252335816460489315313822288366112768901791852399180053604763902892\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Unlock Protocol</a>, <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/treasuregaming.eth/proposal/0x957349f6d60f07e95d6e426536996af96ca63f0b9e0495ee8e73554207cb2381\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Treasure</a> and <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xc25a02d6520fd69ae98ef10b72f3024db2e710d00d51fbc7c03581710e0b8b7b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1inch</a></p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Create a daoURI for Arbitrum DAO:</strong> Based on conversations during the Arbitrum GovHack, and feedback from various delegates and contributors over the past 4 weeks, we have built this daoURI for Arbitrum:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUrBuJLBCZKnnEebwRe2Yqh3fk39H2mtqPQjMPUwVC1Ap\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUrBuJLBCZKnnEebwRe2Yqh3fk39H2mtqPQjMPUwVC1Ap</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f16421692ac57342eedec922ee38e734c95d7284.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/yrrB8Aw6IHOhZ43Dke1Mjpj3ESo.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-08-16 at 11.50.33 AM\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f16421692ac57342eedec922ee38e734c95d7284_2_690x188.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-16 at 11.50.33 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"yrrB8Aw6IHOhZ43Dke1Mjpj3ESo\" width=\"690\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f16421692ac57342eedec922ee38e734c95d7284_2_690x188.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f16421692ac57342eedec922ee38e734c95d7284_2_1035x282.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f16421692ac57342eedec922ee38e734c95d7284_2_1380x376.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"252525\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>It is presently stored on IPFS, and uses APIs from Tally, Snapshot for governance data.

The daoURI of Arbitrum DAO will continuously evolve and become more comprehensive over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Publish the daoURI onchain:</strong> As detailed in the execution summary above, this will either be a  smart contract call to deploy a new contract, or setting a new txt record on arbitrumfoundation.eth</p>\n<p><strong>Maintain the daoURI:</strong> (Pathway 1) Though daoURI is fully manageable through governance, it is not practical to initiate an onchain vote for every upgrade. To solve this, the DAO can set one or many <em>manager</em>s to manage its daoURI. The Arbitrum Foundation has agreed to take on this role if the DAO decides so. DAOstar will commit to maintaining Arbitrum DAO’s daoURI for a year for at additional cost. Note that <em>managers</em> can be added or removed easily by the DAO.</p>\n<p>(Pathway 2) The DAO will not have the capability to change the daoURI through governance. However, it can instruct the Arbitrum Foundation to do so.</p>\n<p>Irrespective of the adoption pathway, we would like to see the daoURI maintained through a community-led effort.

We develop tailored solutions in governance inception and optimization, ecosystem growth, and service provider selection. Our connected investment bank with deep strategic expertise, enables us to serve our partners holistically, rather than working in isolated governance silos.</p>\n<p>We have had the privilege to work for some of the leading companies and DAOs in the crypto space (Safe, Uniswap, Aave and dYdX). Examples of our work include managing a larger <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/areta-delegate-platform/16780\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aave delegation</a>, setting up key contribution initiatives for <a href=\"https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-17-obra-contribution-efficiency-system-ces-areta/4670\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">SafeDAO</a>, leading the first cross-ecosystem growth initiative for <a href=\"https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/47\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Uniswap</a> and Arbitrum, and crypto-native transactions like the first acquisition of <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/264253/coingecko-first-acquisition-nft-data-startup-zash\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coingecko</a> or the sale of <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/264253/coingecko-first-acquisition-nft-data-startup-zash\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Solscan to Etherscan</a>.</p>\n<p>As DAOs emerge from their infancy, their structures have proven powerful tools for enabling decentralisation and autonomy. We view a well-designed governance system as a critical enabler for decentralized projects to allow them to leverage decentralization as a strategic advantage, rather than an inconvenient necessity (where most of the market is currently at).</p>\n<p>However, DAOs often encounter challenges in maintaining organisation, highlighted by governance issues such as contributor onboarding and delegate overload. These scenarios highlight areas where <strong>DAOs can improve by establishing structured processes</strong> for better collaboration and being <strong>open to further strengthening against inefficiencies.</strong></p>\n<p>Recognising the need for evolution, we focus on <strong>excellent DAO participation with robust, defensible analysis of proposals through a structured voting process</strong> while simultaneously applying our deep institutional knowledge and strategic governance expertise to offer proactive DAO governance solutions <strong>aimed at nurturing the ecosystem for the long term.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-56564-delegate-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-56564-delegate-motivation-3\"></a>Delegate Motivation</h2>\n<p>As long-term supporters and contributors to Arbitrum DAO, we are well-versed with the Arbitrum ecosystem, its stakeholders, and many of the larger delegates.</p>\n<p>Over the course of our involvement in Arbitrum DAO, we have led and supported the following initiatives with dedicated teams:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Uniswap-Arbitrum Grants Program</strong>: We led the first cross-ecosystem growth initiative for Arbitrum and Uniswap by leading a 6-month grants program to allocate 1.1 million ARB in grants to projects exclusively advancing the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem.

DexPal informed the Gains Network team that they might miss the proposed timelines due to a key developer’s absence for the upcoming month(s).

At the core of ShiftCTRL are our Bitcoin-backed stablecoins, known as TABS, designed to provide a stable and resilient alternative to the traditional fiat system.</p>\n<p><strong>Why ShiftCTRL?</strong></p>\n<p>Our current financial system is riddled with challenges—favoring the elite few, plagued by inflation. ShiftCTRL was created as a response to these issues, aiming to rebuild a fairer and more transparent financial system where economic stability and personal liberty can thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>How ShiftCTRL Leverages Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>Scalability and Speed: Arbitrum’s rollup technology provides the scalability and transaction speed needed to support ShiftCTRL’s vision of a global, decentralized monetary framework. This ensures that transactions on the platform are fast and affordable, making the system accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p>Security and Resilience: By anchoring our stablecoins to Bitcoin, the most resilient form of money in history, and utilizing Arbitrum’s secure infrastructure, ShiftCTRL offers a robust system that can withstand economic fluctuations and provide a reliable hedge against inflation.</p>\n<p><strong>Building a Fairer Economy Together</strong></p>\n<p>ShiftCTRL isn’t just another DeFi project; it’s a movement towards a financial system that truly serves humanity. We’re here to work alongside the Arbitrum community to create a future where financial stability is a given, not a privilege. But we recognize that we can’t do this alone. We invite developers, community members, and visionaries within the Arbitrum ecosystem to engage with us, provide feedback, and help shape the future of decentralized finance.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Involved</strong></p>\n<p>We’re eager to hear your thoughts and ideas on how ShiftCTRL can better integrate with and contribute to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Whether it’s through technical collaboration, governance discussions, or just sharing your perspective, your input is invaluable.</p>\n<p>Feel free to check out our testnet, explore our platform, and join us on this journey.</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.shiftctrl.money/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.shiftctrl.money/</a><br>\nDiscord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7w6JhTNt9K\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">shiftCTRL Official Discord</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://x.com/shiftCTRL_money\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">x.com</a><br>\nTestnet Guide: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@shiftCTRL.money/shiftctrl-public-testnet-launch-7a122219059d\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ShiftCTRL Public Testnet Launch.
