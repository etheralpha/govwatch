However, the tally vote earmarked 100k ARB as payment to program manager for one year (which converted to $86,581) while Steakhouse quoted a fee of $174,000 in their application. This proposal seeks input on the right way forward, with the options to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approve only a 6 month contract from available funds</li>\n<li>Earmark additional funds so they complete their one year tenure</li>\n<li>Not have a program manager, which will result in liquidation of the RWAs and</li>\n<li>Conduct a new RFP to select a  program manager for one year at $86,581</li>\n<li>Abstain</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong> - On April 10th 2024, the DAO <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">approved</a> 35 million ARB for diversification into RWAs. Of this, 100,000 ARB was budgeted for the role of program manager. The Arbitrum Foundation got an average price of 87 cents per ARB, resulting in $86,581 to pay the program manager.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/af2547aad4c9a618e8dddf678b3f2d9997026125.jpeg\" alt=\"conversino\" data-base62-sha1=\"oZpqC3ftcOtE8cPnHpfpFBsaPnT\" width=\"594\" height=\"188\"></p>\n<p>In their <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/steakhouse-financial-step-program-manager/23829\">application</a>, Steakhouse quoted $174,000 per year. Given the funds received from the 100,000 ARB sale ($86,531) are less than the amount necessary to pay for a full year of the Program Manager’s services, we need to either shorten their term to 6 months or approve an additional 6 months pay (from yield earned via the program). We can also declare the earlier election null and void while putting out a call for program managers willing to serve at $86,581 for a year. If there is no program manager to oversee investments, assets are liquidated and returned to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> - While writing the Tally proposal, I budgeted 100k ARB for the program manager role based on a quotation received from another provider and the prevailing ARB price at the time.</p>\n<p>Steakhouse financial and the other applicants prepared a budget in dollar value, not ARB. As a result, i under-budgeted the program manager role in the STEP program and now need approval from the DAO on provisioning either a shortened tenure of 6 months or additional funding to complete the one year. The additional funds will be requested from the yield earned on the RWAs (estimated at between $1-2 million per year) to prevent ARB liquidations. Alternatively, we can hold a new RFP seeking program managers at a fixed price of $86,581 for the year and invalidate the earlier election.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong> - The STEP program is one of the largest diversification initiatives at any DAO, seeking to diversify our treasury while simultaneously growing the RWA ecosystem. Given the complications that can arise in managing the large sums of money, it is imperative that the DAO have a capable program manager to recommend liquidations,conduct firedrills, monitor interest payments to the DAO treasury, and track underlying changes in service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong> -  After ratification of their role as STEP program manager and whether it is 6 months or 1 year, the Arbitrum foundation will sign an agreement with Steakhouse Financial and begin investments into selected RWA providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong> -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Post on forum</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upload on Snapshot (Thursday, 12th September)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Foundation negotiates agreement with Steakhouse and pays the first 6 months of their payment from the initial 100,000 ARB budgeted for in the STEP proposal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After RWA yield is returned to the treasury, this proposal is taken to Tally requesting balance of $87,419  (provided one year tenure is approved in the snapshot)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong> - If the entire one year tenure is ratified, the cost to the DAO is $87,419. If 6 month tenure is approved, the cost is needing another election for program manager in a shortened time. If the proposal is rejected, we liquidate all $30 million and return assets to the DAO. If a new RFP is held seeking program manager services for $86,581 for a year, we delay the start of the STEP program and possibly get a less capable pool of applicants at the lower price point.</p>\n<p>Work done in shepherding this proposal is paid for through a Thrivecoin firestarter grant to the Arbitrum treasury and sustainability group.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-terms-of-tenure-for-step-program-manager/26675\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-terms-of-tenure-for-step-program-manager/26675","pubDate":"Sat, 07 Sep 2024 07:59:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26675"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-terms-of-tenure-for-step-program-manager/26675.rss","#text":"**Non-Constitutional: Terms of Tenure for STEP Program Manager**"},"filter":false},{"title":"Stylus SDK Audit","dc:creator":"openzeppelin","category":"General","description":"<p>At the request of the Arbitrum Foundation, OpenZeppelin audited Offchain Lab’s Stylus SDK.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Type:   Smart Contract Language</p>\n<p>Timeline:   From 2024-07-08 To 2024-08-09</p>\n<p>Languages:   Rust</p>\n<p>Total Issues:   36 (27 resolved, 1 partially resolved)</p>\n<p>Critical Severity Issues:   2 (1 resolved, 1 partially resolved)</p>\n<p>High Severity Issues:   2 (2 resolved)</p>\n<p>Medium Severity Issues:   10 (7 resolved)</p>\n<p>Low Severity Issues:   12 (8 resolved)</p>\n<p>Notes &amp; Additional Information:   10 (9 resolved)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-scope-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-scope-2\"></a>Scope</h2>\n<p>We audited the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs</a> repository at commit <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/tree/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">62bd831</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In scope were the following files:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">stylus-proc\n└── src\n    ├── calls\n    │   └── mod.rs\n    ├── lib.rs\n    ├── methods\n    │   ├── entrypoint.rs\n    │   ├── error.rs\n    │   ├── external.rs\n    │   └── mod.rs\n    ├── storage\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   └── proc.rs\n    └── types.rs\nstylus-sdk\n└── src\n    ├── abi\n    │   ├── bytes.rs\n    │   ├── const_string.rs\n    │   ├── export\n    │   │   ├── internal.rs\n    │   │   └── mod.rs\n    │   ├── impls.rs\n    │   ├── internal.rs\n    │   └── mod.rs\n    ├── block.rs\n    ├── call\n    │   ├── context.rs\n    │   ├── error.rs\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   ├── raw.rs\n    │   ├── traits.rs\n    │   └── transfer.rs\n    ├── contract.rs\n    ├── crypto.rs\n    ├── debug.rs\n    ├── deploy\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   └── raw.rs\n    ├── evm.rs\n    ├── hostio.rs\n    ├── lib.rs\n    ├── msg.rs\n    ├── prelude.rs\n    ├── storage\n    │   ├── array.rs\n    │   ├── bytes.rs\n    │   ├── map.rs\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   ├── traits.rs\n    │   └── vec.rs\n    ├── tx.rs\n    ├── types.rs\n    └── util.rs\nexamples\n├── erc20\n│   └── src\n│       ├── erc20.rs\n│       ├── lib.rs\n│       └── main.rs\n├── erc721\n│   └── src\n│       ├── erc721.rs\n│       ├── lib.rs\n│       └── main.rs\n└── single_call\n    └── src\n        ├── lib.rs\n        └── main.rs\nmini-alloc\n├── src\n│   ├── imp.rs\n│   └── lib.rs\n└── tests\n    └── misc.rs\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-system-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-system-overview-3\"></a>System Overview</h2>\n<p>Arbitrum Stylus introduces a paradigm shift in smart contract development by enabling programs to be compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and deployed on-chain, seamlessly coexisting with traditional smart contracts written in common EVM languages like Solidity. This language-agnostic approach opens up new possibilities for developers, enabling them to use their preferred programming languages while maintaining full ABI compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Stylus programs is their exceptional performance and cost-effectiveness. These programs are orders of magnitude cheaper and faster to execute than traditional EVM-based smart contracts while also being fully EVM compatible. This breakthrough enables Stylus programs to interact seamlessly with existing Ethereum smart contracts, creating a bridge between the efficiency of WASM and the established Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-stylus-sdk-for-rust-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-stylus-sdk-for-rust-4\"></a>Stylus SDK for Rust</h3>\n<p>This powerful toolkit enables developers to write programs for Arbitrum chains in Rust. Rust’s combination of performance, safety, and modern features makes it ideal for developing robust and efficient smart contracts. The Stylus SDK for Rust provides a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions that simplify the process of creating Stylus programs. It offers a familiar development experience for Rust programmers while integrating seamlessly with the Arbitrum ecosystem. Some of the features available in the SDK include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generic, storage-backed Rust types for programming Solidity-equivalent smart contracts with optimal storage caching.</li>\n<li>Simple macros for writing language-agnostic methods and entry points.</li>\n<li>Automatic export of Solidity interfaces for interoperability across programming languages.</li>\n<li>Powerful primitive types backed by the feature-rich Alloy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-procedural-macros-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-procedural-macros-5\"></a>Procedural Macros</h2>\n<p>The Stylus Rust SDK leverages several powerful procedural macros to streamline smart contract development and ensure seamless integration with the EVM ecosystem. These macros automate complex tasks such as trait implementation, method exposure, storage management, and inter-contract communication, allowing developers to write idiomatic Rust code while maintaining full compatibility with contracts made with EVM-compatible languages.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-entrypoint-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-entrypoint-6\"></a><code>entrypoint</code></h3>\n<p>This macro defines the entry point for Stylus execution. It implements the <code>TopLevelStorage</code> trait and is typically used to annotate the top-level storage struct. This macro sets up the necessary boilerplate for handling incoming calls, parsing calldata, and serializing results. It also manages reentrancy protection, integrating with the Stylus VM’s execution model.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-external-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-external-7\"></a><code>external</code></h3>\n<p>This macro is used to make methods “external” so that they can be called by other contracts. It implements the <code>Router</code> trait for the annotated <code>impl</code> block. The macro handles the complexities of ABI encoding and decoding, method selector generation, and integration with the Stylus VM’s calling conventions. It also manages purity annotations (<code>pure</code>, <code>view</code>, <code>payable</code>) and can infer these based on the method signature if not explicitly specified. This macro can have the <code>#[inherit]</code> attribute to implement inheritance-like behavior, allowing a contract to include methods from parent contracts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-sol_interface-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-sol_interface-8\"></a><code>sol_interface</code></h3>\n<p>It transforms Solidity interface definitions into Rust structs and methods, enabling seamless interaction with other contracts. The macro handles method generation, type conversion, function selector calculation, and call context management. It supports various call types (<code>pure</code>, <code>view</code>, and <code>payable</code>) and accommodates reentrancy concerns. By automating the creation of ABI-compatible Rust code, it simplifies cross-contract communication while maintaining type safety and idiomatic Rust practices. This macro acts as a translator, enabling Rust contracts to integrate with the broader EVM ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-solidity_storage-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-solidity_storage-9\"></a><code>solidity_storage</code></h3>\n<p>This attribute macro is applied to Rust structs to enable their use in persistent storage within a smart contract. Each field in the struct must implement the <code>StorageType</code> trait which ensures EVM storage model compatibility. Applying this macro allows developers to define storage layouts directly in Rust, with the fields mapping to the corresponding storage slots in the EVM. This macro ensures that the storage layout of the Rust structs aligns with that of Solidity, facilitating seamless upgrades and interactions with existing Solidity contracts. It supports nested structs and various storage types like <code>StorageAddress</code>, <code>StorageBool</code>, and custom types implementing <code>StorageType</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-sol_storage-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-sol_storage-10\"></a><code>sol_storage</code></h3>\n<p>This macro enables the definition of Rust structs using Solidity-like syntax. It ensures that the storage layout of these structs is identical to their Solidity counterparts. This macro simplifies the transition from Solidity to Rust by allowing developers to reuse their Solidity type definitions directly in Rust, maintaining compatibility with existing storage layouts. This macro uses <code>solidity_storage</code> macro under the hood.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-derive_solidity_error-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-derive_solidity_error-11\"></a><code>derive_solidity_error</code></h3>\n<p>This macro allows Rust enums to be used for error handling in contract methods. It enables enums to be automatically converted into Solidity-compatible error messages that can be returned by smart contract functions. Under the hood, the macro works by implementing <code>From&lt;YOUR_ERROR&gt;</code> for <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> along with printing code for <code>export-abi</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-derive_erase-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-derive_erase-12\"></a><code>derive_erase</code></h3>\n<p>This macro automatically implements the <code>Erase</code> trait for a struct. It generates an <code>erase()</code> method that calls <code>erase()</code> on each of the struct’s fields. This allows for easy clearing of complex storage structures in Arbitrum Stylus smart contracts, ensuring that all fields are properly erased without manual implementation. The macro cannot implement Erase for types that do not support it, such as mappings.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-core-modules-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-core-modules-13\"></a>Core Modules</h2>\n<p>The following modules are contained within the <code>stylus-sdk</code> folder to facilitate smart contract development and interaction with the Stylus WASM module:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-abi-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-abi-14\"></a><code>abi</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>abi</code> module provides functionality for encoding and decoding data according to the Ethereum Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification. It enables a two-way mapping between Solidity and Rust types, allowing for interoperability between Rust and Solidity contracts. The module supports encoding function calls into byte arrays and decoding contract responses back into Rust types. The <code>abi</code> module also includes utilities to generate method selectors and export Solidity interfaces, treating <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> as <code>uint8[]</code> in Solidity and using the <code>Bytes</code> type for Solidity <code>bytes</code>. This functionality is essential for communication between Rust-based smart contracts and those written in Solidity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-call-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-call-15\"></a><code>call</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>call</code> module manages interactions with external contracts by handling the execution context and providing mechanisms for standard and raw contract calls. It allows developers to specify gas limits and call values, and access contract storage. The module includes caching strategies to optimize repeated state access and features for safe execution during re-entrant calls. By managing these aspects, the <code>call</code> module enables Rust-based contracts to interact with Ethereum contracts, facilitating contract communication and data exchange.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-deploy-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-deploy-16\"></a><code>deploy</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>deploy</code> module facilitates the deployment of contracts on the Arbitrum network. It includes functionalities for both standard and raw deployments, offering flexibility and control over the deployment process. The <code>raw.rs</code> file provides lower-level deployment functions, allowing for more granular control and potentially unsafe operations. This module supports setting deployment parameters, handling the deployment process, and ensuring correct contract initialization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-storage-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-storage-17\"></a><code>storage</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>storage</code> module provides a comprehensive framework for managing smart contract storage, featuring abstractions for common data structures like arrays, bytes, maps, and vectors. It supports both basic and complex storage operations through a set of defined traits, ensuring proper data handling and access. The module allows developers to define custom storage logic by implementing the <code>StorageType</code> trait, enabling more advanced data manipulation while providing persistent storage access in the Rust-based contracts. Stylus contracts run on a virtual machine that shares the same EVM State Trie, allowing access to Ethereum’s key-value storage. The module provides types and traits for safe storage access using Rust’s borrow checker, preventing unsafe aliasing of storage.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-hostio-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-hostio-18\"></a><code>hostio</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>hostio</code> module facilitates interactions between Rust-based smart contracts and the host environment on the Arbitrum blockchain. It provides a set of functions for managing contract state, executing calls, and handling I/O operations via a foreign-function interface to the Stylus WASM VM which ultimately communicates with the core blockchain. The <code>wrap_hostio</code> macro is a key component of this module, designed to simplify and streamline the process of defining host functions. It wraps low-level host operations in Rust-safe abstractions, automatically generating bindings to interact with the blockchain. Several single-file modules in the Stylus SDK provide typical blockchain interactions extensively using the <code>wrap_hostio</code> module, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>block</code></strong>: Provides access to Ethereum block information, including properties like the block number, timestamp, and miner details. It serves as an interface for retrieving data about the current or past blocks on the blockchain.</li>\n<li><strong><code>contract</code></strong>: Facilitates interactions with other contracts, enabling function calls and access to contract metadata. It allows contracts to perform operations such as balance checks and contract code retrieval.</li>\n<li><strong><code>crypto</code></strong>: Offers cryptographic functions and utilities, such as hashing algorithms and signature verification.</li>\n<li><strong><code>evm</code></strong>: Interfaces with the EVM, managing execution resources and logging. It includes utilities to query remaining gas and ink (Stylus-specific compute units), emit logs both in raw and alloy-typed forms, and manage memory growth.</li>\n<li><strong><code>msg</code></strong>: Handles message-passing operations, providing information about the current transaction, such as the sender, value, and gas. It allows contracts to interact with transaction data and control flow.</li>\n<li><strong><code>tx</code></strong>: Provides transaction-related functionality, including accessing transaction details like gas price and origin. It enables contracts to work with transaction-specific data and execute transaction-based logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-mini-allocator-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-mini-allocator-19\"></a>Mini Allocator</h2>\n<p>This allocator is key to the Stylus ecosystem, optimized for wasm32 targets like Arbitrum Stylus. It uses a minimal bump allocator strategy, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency. Notably, mini-alloc never deallocates memory, which is ideal for scenarios with tight binary size constraints where it is acceptable to leak all allocations. This design choice enhances performance, aligning with Stylus’ focus on optimizing for blockchain environments where traditional memory management can add unnecessary overhead.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-examples-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-examples-20\"></a>Examples</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum Stylus SDK repository contains three example crates of common smart contract designs: <code>erc20</code>, <code>erc721</code>, and <code>single_call</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>erc20</code></strong>: Demonstrates an ERC-20 token contract with functionalities like minting, transferring, and checking balances. It includes methods for token transfers and managing allowances.</li>\n<li><strong><code>erc721</code></strong>: Illustrates an ERC-721 NFT contract implementation, covering minting, transferring, and querying ownership of unique tokens. It also handles token metadata and ensures compatibility with the ERC-721 standard.</li>\n<li><strong><code>single_cal</code></strong>: Showcases a simple contract for making a single call to another contract, demonstrating inter-contract communication within the Arbitrum environment using the Stylus SDK.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-trust-assumptions-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-trust-assumptions-21\"></a>Trust Assumptions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SDK Integrity</strong>: It is assumed that the Stylus SDK itself is free from malicious code, such as backdoors or other vulnerabilities that could circumvent the behavior of the underlying blockchain. The SDK is expected to function as described in its documentation, ensuring that developers can rely on its behavior as intended.</li>\n<li><strong>WASM VM and Stylus Module Compliance</strong>: It is assumed that the WASM VM and Stylus module strictly follow the consensus rules as outlined by the core EVM part of Arbitrum. This ensures that the execution within the Stylus environment is consistent with the broader consensus rules governing the Arbitrum network, maintaining the integrity and reliability of smart contract execution.</li>\n<li><strong>Third-Party Dependencies</strong>: Any third-party libraries or dependencies integrated with the Stylus SDK are trusted to be secure and regularly updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart Contract Interfaces</strong>: It is assumed that the ABIs generated by the Stylus SDK for contracts are correct and that smart contracts behave in an expected manner, similar to Solidity contracts. This means that from an external perspective, the contracts should exhibit predictable and standard behavior, ensuring compatibility and reliability for the users interacting with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-critical-severity-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-critical-severity-22\"></a>Critical Severity</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-storage-layout-is-inconsistent-with-solidity-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-storage-layout-is-inconsistent-with-solidity-23\"></a>Storage Layout is Inconsistent with Solidity</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/rust-sdk-guide#sol_storage\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documentation</a> asserts that struct fields in Stylus will map to the same storage slots as in EVM programming languages and that the layout will be identical to <a href=\"https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Solidity’s</a>.

In Solidity, the <code>receive</code> function handles direct transfers of ETH to a contract. Without this function, contracts cannot accept plain ETH transfers, thereby limiting ETH transfers to those including data which triggers a specific function call. For example, contracts like <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.9.6/contracts/finance/PaymentSplitter.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>PaymentSplitter</code></a> will only work for externally owned accounts (EOAs) due to the lack of a <code>receive</code> function. In addition, many proxy patterns rely on the <code>fallback</code> function to forward calls to another contract. Without a <code>fallback</code> function, implementing upgradable contracts or beacon proxy patterns becomes much more complex, requiring alternative mechanisms to delegate calls to other contracts.</p>\n<p>Consider implementing <code>receive</code> and <code>fallback</code> functions to ensure full compatibility with Solidity contracts.

These Stylus programs are compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and can be deployed on-chain to run alongside Solidity smart contracts. This innovative approach aims to combine the efficiency of WASM execution with the robustness of programming in Rust, all the while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</p>\n<p>During the security audit of the Stylus SDK, we discovered numerous security issues and also made extensive recommendations for the improvement of the overall design. The project is clearly still under development, having several features that are either non-functional or contain bugs. However, the development team showed a strong commitment to addressing these concerns and we encourage them to continue their efforts. Once all the identified issues are resolved, further improvements are made, and the project reaches a more mature stage, we strongly recommend the team to consider conducting a follow-up audit to ensure comprehensive security.</p>\n<p>Despite the current challenges, we see great potential in the Stylus SDK. We look forward to seeing how the project evolves, particularly as the team addresses the identified issues and continues to refine the SDK. We believe that further development of the Stylus SDK could introduce exciting new possibilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem and the broader world of smart contract development.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sdk-audit/26674\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sdk-audit/26674","pubDate":"Sat, 07 Sep 2024 03:19:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26674"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sdk-audit/26674.rss","#text":"Stylus SDK Audit"},"filter":false},{"title":"Delegate Incentive Program Results (AUGUST 2024)","dc:creator":"SEEDGov","category":"Delegate Incentives Program","description":"<p>We are proud to announce the initial outcomes of the fifth month of the Delegate Incentive Program.

name=\"p-57970-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h3>\n<p>OpenZeppelin, the Security Member of the ARDC, reviewed the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/enhancing-multichain-governance-upgrading-rari-governance-token-on-arbitrum/26096\">Rari multichain governance proposal</a> and its specifications. If enacted, the proposal execution will register a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract that will migrate the RARI DAO from the Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The <a href=\"https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">new token contract</a> has been fully audited and deployed to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet and all contracts have been manually tested.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-overview-2\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>The $RARI token that is used to govern the RARI DAO is currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradeable. However, the RARI DAO would like to upgrade its governance to allow for new features to be implemented such as snapshots and delegations. By bringing its governance to the Arbitrum ecosystem, RARI DAO would also improve the user experience through lower gas fees and increased accessibility of their system. Despite the non-upgradeability of the $RARI token, it is possible to make these changes to the governance model by using a custom gateway to register a new token contract. This proposed solution requires the Arbitrum DAO’s approval.</p>\n<p>Despite the non-upgradeability of the $RARI token, it is possible to make these changes to the governance model by using a custom gateway to register a new token contract. This proposed solution requires the Arbitrum DAO’s approval.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-57970-custom-gateway-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-custom-gateway-motivation-3\"></a>Custom Gateway Motivation</h4>\n<p>The Arbitrum chain allows for tokens to be bridged between various networks, such as between Arbitrum and Ethereum. In the case of many ERC-20 tokens, this involves associating a token contract on some other chain with a paired token contract on Arbitrum. When users wish to bridge their tokens, the tokens are escrowed in a bridge contract on the host chain, and an equal amount of tokens is minted on Arbitrum. Using <code>StandardERC20Gateway</code>, any ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainnet can be permissionlessly bridged to Arbitrum by default. However, this standard approach is not suitable for some tokens. For example, tokens accruing interest need to ensure that the rewards are dispersed properly to other chains instead of just being accrued to the bridge contract. A <strong>custom gateway system</strong> allows for specialized cross-chain asset bridging in such exceptional cases where additional bridging logic is necessary to be implemented.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum generic-custom gateway is designed as a flexible solution that is suitable for most custom needs beyond what is available using <code>StandardERC20Gateway</code>. In the case of the new $RARI token, the proposed changes include the addition of snapshotting and delegation functions, as well as the introduction of proxy-based upgradeability. According to the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum Foundation documentation</a>, this is likely the right solution for such a migration since these changes are limited in scope (as opposed to the addition of minting functionality directly on Arbitrum, for example).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-technical-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-technical-details-4\"></a>Technical Details</h3>\n<p>In order to register the new $RARI token to the custom gateway, <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the relevant steps</a> are outlined by the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Deploy your token on Arbitrum</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The new $RARI token deployed on Arbitrum should conform to the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/IArbToken.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">IArbToken</a> interface, as in the following <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/L2GatewayToken.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example implementation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Register your token on L1 to your token on L2 via the <code>L1CustomGateway</code> contract</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The $RARI token currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet should make an external call to <code>L1CustomGateway.registerTokenToL2</code>. This registration can alternatively be performed as a chain-owner registration via an Arbitrum DAO proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Register your token on L1 to the L1Gateway router</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Finally, the $RARI token deployed on the Ethereum mainnet should make an external call to <code>L1GatewayRouter.setGateway</code>. This registration can alternatively be performed as a chain-owner registration via an Arbitrum DAO proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The RARI DAO has already voted in favor of a <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/85102068202527969889208024703113668965813715410446115075088330064807449302588\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposal</a> that would deploy the custom $RARI token on Arbitrum, ensuring the completion of the first action item. The RARI DAO is now requesting registration to the <code>L1CustomGateway</code> and <code>L1GatewayRouter</code> contracts via this governance proposal. The mapping between the tokens deployed on the mainnet and the Arbitrum chain would then be updated and the RARI token would be registered to the generic-custom gateway, completing the remaining two steps in the registration process.</p>\n<p>The upgraded token contract from the proposal has also been <a href=\"https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fully audited</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The proposed changes, including registration of a new $RARI token to the generic-custom gateway, are appropriate to meet the needs of the RARI DAO. Since the currently deployed contracts are non-upgradeable and the RARI DAO wishes to add new features to their token, as well as enhance user experience, this operation is necessary. Using the standard ERC-20 gateway would not support the new desired enhancements and the changes do not require a unique, tailor-made gateway. Registering with the generic-custom gateway is a good fit for this transition.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648","pubDate":"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 18:59:25 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26648"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648.rss","#text":"RARI Multichain Governance Proposal Security Review"},"filter":false},{"title":"Lampros Labs DAO Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"Euphoria","category":"Delegate Statements","description":"<p><strong>Delegate Address:</strong> 0xA2D590FEe197C0b614Fe7c3E10303327F38C0dc3<br>\n<strong>Team Member Handles:</strong> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/blueweb\">@Blueweb</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/euphoria\">@Euphoria</a> &amp; <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/nyx\">@Nyx</a><br>\n<strong>Tally Profile:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xa2d590fee197c0b614fe7c3e10303327f38c0dc3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a><br>\n<strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://lamproslabs.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a><br>\n<strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/lamproslabsdao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Delegate Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Lampros Labs DAO is an open community of builders and governance enthusiasts committed to transparency, decentralization, and inclusivity.

Currently, the clr.fund is using MACI.</p>\n<p>MACI can stand alone as a voting system. New users must deposit their tokens when signing and will create a new key pair to vote. There will need to be some customization in order to integrate MACI into the Security council governor. One other complication is that MACI relies on a trusted coordinator to gather and report the vote tally. This coordinator can decrypt votes and can choose to never conclude a round.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Private, but votes can be read by the trusted coordinator.</td>\n<td>Needs a trusted coordinator</td>\n<td>The voter cannot reveal their vote</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The project is under active development and is a promising solution despite its complexity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-semaphore-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-semaphore-5\"></a>Semaphore</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://semaphore.pse.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore</a> offers anonymous group-based signaling and can be used as a foundation to build a private voting system.

As the number of depositors increase the anonymity of the votes increase, and deposits should be represented in fixed numbers. An account that has multiple deposits will have to vote multiple times using multiple transactions. An account will also have to face the trade-off of privately voting and losing their liquidity</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-57854-implementation-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-implementation-10\"></a>Implementation</h4>\n<p>In this construction, a user would deposit their ARB tokens along with a commitment hash of two secrets.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Depositors of the token pool, through a relayer, can cast their vote fractionally using Flexible Voting. A valid proof of a deposit, and a proposal id is required to prevent double voting. Using a zero knowledge proof, depositors can generate a merkle proof without revealing their secrets. Snapshots of merkle tree roots should be stored in order to prevent late depositors to vote for a proposal that has already started.</p>\n<p>To withdraw their deposits, the users will provide their secrets and will be able to withdraw back to the original depositor address that corresponds to the deposit commitment hash. Although all the technological pieces for this solution exist, and have been proven to work in other contexts, a  non-trivial amount of work would be required to put them together to construct production-ready privacy preserving voting. Nonetheless, this approach seems promising, as the work needed is primarily engineering work, rather than fundamental research…</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-stealth-voting-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-stealth-voting-11\"></a>Stealth voting</h3>\n<p>Another possible bespoke solution is a voting system that utilizes stealth addresses via ERC-5564 and ERC-6538. This implementation will require a trusted coordinator that is responsible for holding private keys corresponding stealth meta-addresses and tallying votes correctly.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Needs a trusted coordinator</td>\n<td>Can be optional with an additional governance extension contract</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h4><a name=\"p-57854-implementation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-implementation-12\"></a>Implementation</h4>\n<p>The basic idea is that a trusted coordinator will generate stealth meta-addresses corresponding to each option in a proposal. And anyone can announce their vote preference for a given proposal by including a stealth address generated using one of the stealth meta-addresses. Once the voting period ends, the trusted coordinator can tally the announcements each stealth meta-address owner has received, and output the winning option.</p>\n<p>This implementation would have the usual benefits that comes with stealth addresses. Voters can vote without an extra step and with their full voting weight, but their vote preference is linked to the stealth address’ hidden owner. There’s no liquidity concern as long as your voting weight can be queried from the token. The trusted coordinator portion could potentially be improved by incorporating a zero knowledge proof step to prove that tallying was done correctly. The governor will need to be upgraded to accept tallying results and an extension could be added to overwrite the behaviors of the default <code>castVote</code> function.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-railgun-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-railgun-13\"></a>Railgun</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.railgun.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Railgun</a> as it is now offers transaction anonymity, meaning the identity of the sender, recipient, token, and amount remain private once onboarded onto the system with new private key pairs. Critically, Railgun allows those who have deposited into the privacy pool to interact with external contracts by submitting zero knowledge proofs. Wallet software must be developed to construct the proofs for specific external calls and forward them to Railguns relayer network. The Railgun protcol charges a fee for each transaction sent in this manner.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Customizing or creating a solution based on Railgun might prove challenging while introducing new reliance on the existing Railgun infrastructure. It still is a great privacy framework to keep in mind and Railgun SDK could help with this process. Bridging the gap between its current implementation and unique requirements of an onchain governance system will require significant research and effort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-conclusion-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-conclusion-14\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our assessment of existing private voting solutions concludes that although there are several projects and tools that enable private voting, none of them are plug and play with Arbitrum DAO’s existing governance system. Any effort to add private voting would require additional effort to integrate a privacy solution with a new customized governor.</p>\n<p>We provided different trade-offs and it’s crucial to seek DAO members’ input on implementing an onchain private voting solution, their priorities and preferences, including voter anonymity, result verifiability, and potential trade-offs.</p>\n<p>We recommend the DAO to further explore the proposed new approaches when considering how to bring private voting to the security council election processes. In particular, the Shieled Pool solution seems the most promising in terms of a system that could be producitionized with a reasonable amount of effort, yet has minimal tradeoffs as it relates to privacy properties. Nonetheless, such an effort would require significant resource to be dedicated to developing proof of concepts, further research, audits and bug bounties.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-partial-delegation-solutions-assessments-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-partial-delegation-solutions-assessments-15\"></a>Partial Delegation Solutions Assessments</h2>\n<p>The current delegation structure limits token holders to delegating their voting power to a single address.

It works by having a user deposit the funds into a Franchiser contract that delegates them to the desired delegate. This system allows for the tokens to also be redelegated to another franchiser address.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Separate Vote flow</th>\n<th>Loss of liquidity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-57854-paritial-delegation-erc20votes-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-paritial-delegation-erc20votes-18\"></a>Paritial Delegation ERC20Votes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/voteagora/ERC20VotesPartialDelegationUpgradeable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">This solution</a> was developed by Agora with help from ScopeLift. It overrides the ERC20Votes token contract to allow a token holder to delegate to multiple addresses. It maintains the voting flow and does not cause the token holder to lose liquidity.

It enables token holders to delegate voting power to multiple addresses without losing liquidity and maintains the existing voting flow. Although, it requires a token upgrade and introduces higher gas costs for token transfers, these issues are not a deal breaker because Arbitrum’s token is upgradeable and the token existing on Arbitrum makes gas costs less of a concern. Additionally, the absence of sub-delegation support is not a critical limitation for the current needs of the DAO. Therefore, this solution aligns well with the DAO’s objectives for improved governance flexibility.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-references-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-references-20\"></a>References</h2>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/icon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"64\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore Demo</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a65b4bbcb6742b2b016fcc9d20faaba397072d77_2_690x362.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"13193A\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore Demo</a></h3>\n\n  <p>A zero-knowledge protocol for anonymous signaling on Ethereum.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<p><a href=\"https://projects.ethberlin.org/submissions/334\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://projects.ethberlin.org/submissions/334</a></p><aside class=\"onebox githubrepo\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\" data-github-private-repo=\"false\">\n  <img width=\"690\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b7ab5d00b81bea8be24673a3e4d6e172df72c1d4_2_690x344.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEAEA\">\n\n  <h3><a href=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig: Implementation of PLUME: nullifier friendly...</a></h3>\n\n    <p><span class=\"github-repo-description\">Implementation of PLUME: nullifier friendly signature scheme on ECDSA</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://research.aragon.org/img/main-logo.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">research.aragon.org</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/388;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/ac25e645cdcb672e291b803805ff01d91fde1202_2_690x388.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"B8A3ED\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Nouns Private Voting Research Sprint - General Report - Aragon ZK Research -...</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Nouns sprint report</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/edf96faf9653815ad054301e915997f2bf67ee6d.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"000000\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" title=\"12:00AM - 12 December 2023\">blog.rs – 12 Dec 23</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8605049b519148caab57e1f7c879f9589419ba47_2_500x500.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"4C4943\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The State of Private Voting in Ethereum</a></h3>\n\n  <p>The State of Private Voting in Ethereum and beyond.

As the leading scaling tech stack, we view Arbitrum as best primed to deliver on this vision and have therefore committed to work exclusively with the Arbitrum DAO.

We envision a world where investors, users, and developers focus on contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem without even making the conscious decision to do so, primarily because the network effects have grown so exponentially that “Why Arbitrum?” is no longer a question being asked. We believe the Arbitrum tech speaks for itself in practice, and that with proper stewardship and contributions to the Arbitrum DAO, the aforementioned question will turn into “Why not Arbitrum?”.</p>\n<p>We are interested in contributing to all areas of the Arbitrum ecosystem as needs arise, but will be focusing on improving governance participation as well as tooling and protocol decentralization. The Arbitrum DAO is Entropy Advisors’ only customer, which is not something many other Arbitrum delegates can tout today. Our employees have extensive experience in research and have been active across numerous DAOs in the past, but have identified Arbitrum as the most promising technology stack and want to put all of our time, effort, and collective brainpower into ensuring the sustainable growth of the ecosystem – powered by the Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<p>Put simply, we believe in a diverse and highly capable delegate base, a DAO that is sustainable through diversified and robust revenue streams, responsible and carefully calculated spending that encourages the growth of the ecosystem, a highly intellectual group of service providers that can effectively execute on tasks on behalf of the DAO, and measures for accountability/processes that can stand the test of time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57846-conflicts-of-interest-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57846-conflicts-of-interest-3\"></a>Conflicts of Interest</h3>\n<p>Entropy Advisors often authors or is directly involved in several proposals within Arbitrum DAO.

I’m rxpwnz, currently serving as a community manager and technical moderator for the Hop Protocol, a role I’ve dedicated myself to for nearly three years. My responsibilities extend across several critical areas including operational security (OpSec), community support, troubleshooting, bug and vulnerability reporting, and more. Additionally, I have been a part of the Community Multisig committee at Hop Protocol for over a year, contributing to key governance decisions and securing community funds. I believe my unique blend of experience in these areas makes me an excellent candidate for the Security Council.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational Security (OpSec):</strong> In my current role, I prioritize the safety and security of our community members across all platforms, from Discord to our Forum, and beyond into broader web security. My proactive approach to OpSec has led to the elimination of over 150 phishing websites impersonating Hop Protocol, achieved by reporting these threats to MetaMask, various domain registrar providers, and Google.</p>\n<p>During a significant security incident involving our Discord server, where a moderator’s account was compromised, I acted swiftly to contain the breach. By disabling the compromised account’s access within minutes, I ensured that the impact on our community was minimal. This swift response was made possible by implementing a least privilege access model, which I advocate for and enforce rigorously.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Support &amp; Troubleshooting:</strong> Beyond security, I am deeply involved in providing community support and troubleshooting issues as they arise. This includes identifying and reporting bugs and vulnerabilities that could affect the user experience or the security of the platform. My hands-on approach ensures that our community remains engaged, informed, and secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Background in DevOps:</strong> In addition to my work in the crypto space, I bring a strong background as a DevOps engineer with a specialization in production incident resolution. My experience spans handling critical incidents during both regular business hours and 24/7 on-call shifts. I have led cross-team war rooms during critical incidents and have conducted thorough root cause analyses to prevent future occurrences.</p>\n<p><strong>Why I’m a Fit for the Security Council:</strong> My extensive experience in operational security within the Hop Protocol community, combined with my technical expertise in DevOps, positions me uniquely to contribute meaningfully to the Security Council. I am passionate about safeguarding our community and have a proven track record of taking proactive measures to mitigate risks and address threats swiftly.</p>\n<p>I look forward to the opportunity to bring my experience, dedication, and proactive mindset to the Security Council, ensuring the continued safety and resilience of our community.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631","pubDate":"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 16:34:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26631"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631.rss","#text":"Rxpwnz - Candidate for Security Council Elections 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"Arbitrum Offsite format: online vs IRL","dc:creator":"danielo","category":"Proposals","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-57826-arbitrumdao-off-site-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-arbitrumdao-off-site-1\"></a>ArbitrumDAO Off-site</h1>\n<p>Non-Constitutional</p>\n<p>This proposal is a continuation of the directional proposal for an offsite which was voted in favour with 130mn ARB in Snapshot: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site-directional-proposal/25660\" class=\"inline-onebox\">ArbitrumDAO Off-site - Directional proposal</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This proposal aims to enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among token holders (including delegates) and key stakeholders by organizing a dedicated off-site event. The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured event will be organized in Q4, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.</p>\n<p>This proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to prioritise the most important agenda items to be discussed at the evente, ensuring the meeting time is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The event will then include professional facilitation to advance alignment, remove blockers, ensure proper note-taking, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.</p>\n<p>The success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem</h2>\n<p>The DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.</p>\n<p>Areas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to test a format for deliberation between key stakeholders with a clearly defined agenda. If successful, the format can be replicated to continuously address agenda items.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution</h2>\n<p>Recent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for focused events to catalyse progress.

We ran a survey, answered by 29 delegates with 86mn+ ARB represented. And then ran SimScore (a collective intelligence algorithm) to cluster responses and identify the key topics. The results are presented below to encourage further discussion.</p>\n<p>Pre-selection of topics (to be refined and prioritised after the format is defined):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defining strategic priorities for the DAO (vision and strategy)</li>\n<li>DAO Budget (how much should the DAO be spending)</li>\n<li>Org Design</li>\n<li>ARB token utility</li>\n<li>Conflict Of Interest</li>\n<li>Grant programs (RPGF, what should be the focus, outcomes, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional work to be done to define the agenda:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 workshops and async discussion to identify root causes (root topics) and prioritise.</li>\n<li>The final agenda will be defined via a subsequent Snapshot vote facilitated by the project manager.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-hybrid-participation-for-irl-events-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-hybrid-participation-for-irl-events-12\"></a>Hybrid Participation for IRL events</h3>\n<p>We’ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost about $600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties. The online setup is of course less good than being IRL but it is still viable to contribute to sessions (anyone leading a session does need to be IRL but, for input in the discussion, online works).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-attendees-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-attendees-13\"></a>Attendees</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on high-context, expert, and senior participants.

Each allocation is carefully crafted for maximum impact, always taking into account available co-incentive schemes and experimenting with different distribution methods and target APYs.</p>\n<p>The delay can be attributed to two factors:<br>\n(1) some ARB was earmarked for integrations with Silo, Spectra, and CreditGuild, which are only now ready to start. And additionally for a further integration with Aave GHO, who is requesting a similar <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-aave-dao-ltipp-grant-extension-request/26612\">extension</a>.</p>\n<p>(2) Similarly, in addition to the rollout of the yield-bearing version, sGYD, a dedicated staking infrastructure was developed that only went live last week.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Generally, the LTIPP grant has been a great success for Gyroscope. ARB is being used to incentivize the use of the GYD meta-stablecoin and to encourage the adoption of Gyroscope’s concentrated liquidity AMMs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gyroscope pools saw a large capital inflow. In the latest period from Aug-26-to-date, the average TVL of Gyroscope pools with ARB incentives was <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3923512\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">11m USD</a>.  Gyroscope’s TVL on Arbitrum grew from 1.48m to 16.7m <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3993279/6720961\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">over the course of LTIPP</a> so far.</li>\n<li>The stablecoin GYD has also seen a lot of adoption on Arbitrum due to ARB incentives. The newly launched yield-bearing version, sGYD, has 70% of its entire supply on Arbitrum, with the remaining 30% being on Ethereum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The remaining 20274.4285716 ARB are planned to be used to bootstrap additional use-cases of sGYD on Arbitrum (via, for example, a Spectra yield-market), generally encourage (s)GYD adoption, and further incentivize Gyroscope AMMs that are coming to market now. Gyroscope plans to match incentives on Arbitrum after LTIPP through sGYD yield sharing mechanisms, SPIN points, and SPIN for Balancer incentive votes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant an extension on deadline to allocate remaining ARB from LTIPP Grant for Gyroscope to allocate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The extension will utilize the remaining ARB tokens from our original proposal for liquidity mining on Gyroscope.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-steps-to-implement-6\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The last, missing integrations with other Arbitrum DeFi participants are very close to being concluded. Even if they were to fail, key infrastructure is in place and existing incentive channels are showing great success.</li>\n<li>Additional time to allow the last integrations to come in and continue to carefully allocate incentives for maximum impact is all that is needed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-timeline-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-timeline-7\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Start Date: September 2nd 2024</li>\n<li>End Date: October 2nd 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57778-overall-cost-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57778-overall-cost-8\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p>The extension utilizes the remaining ARB tokens from the originally approved 100k ARB grant.
