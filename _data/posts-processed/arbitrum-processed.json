It is common for these initiatives to have a multi-signature wallet (multi-sig) committee responsible for managing and dispersing DAO-approved funds, following the terms agreed by the DAO via on-chain governance, as well as with the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836\">DAO recently approved the Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)</a>, so there will likely be greater standardization and streamlined multi-sig operations going forward. Accordingly, the Arbitrum Foundation would like to share some ‘Multi-Sig Best Practices’ based on its observations of the existing DAO-related multi-sigs. It is recommended that DAO-related multi-sigs, including the MSS, follow the guidelines and processes outlined below to adhere to high operational security (OpSec) standards.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-signer-best-practices-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-signer-best-practices-1\"></a>Signer Best Practices</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use Secure Hardware:</strong> Maintain at least two hardware wallets with the same seed phrase. These hardware wallets should be exclusively dedicated to DAO-related multi-sig transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Dedicated Devices:</strong> Utilize a separate, dedicated laptop or device solely for signing transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Unique Signer Addresses (Keys):</strong> Use a unique signer address (key) for each DAO-related multi-sig wallet. Avoid reusing addresses (keys) across different DAO-related multi-sig wallets. Each unique signer address (key) can be generated from the same wallet (i.e. using the same seed phrase). All signer addresses must be shared with the Arbitrum Foundation to pass compliance.</li>\n<li><strong>Unique Payment Address:</strong> If you receive compensation for performing multi-sig signer duties, use a separate address from your signer address(es) to receive payments. All payment addresses must be shared with the Arbitrum Foundation to pass compliance.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction Simulation:</strong> Always simulate transactions using Tenderly (available on Safe) to ensure the transaction performs as intended before signing.</li>\n<li><strong>Verify Information:</strong> Double-check all relevant sources of truth, such as the on-chain Tally proposal, before signing any transaction. If in doubt, do reach out to the DAO Relations team at the Arbitrum Foundation (<a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/raam\">@raam</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cliffton.eth\">@cliffton.eth</a>), and to fellow signers, to ensure that all details about the queued payment(s) are accurate as per the on-chain Tally proposal and agreement terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise Caution and Seek Assistance:</strong> If you are unsure about a transaction, do not sign. Raise any concerns with fellow signers immediately. If you encounter any technical issues, promptly ask for help.</li>\n<li><strong>Bookmark Essential Links:</strong> Bookmark links to DAO-related multi-sig wallets or rely on pre-established, trusted sources. Avoid clicking on links provided by external parties.</li>\n<li><strong>Availability Notification:</strong> Inform fellow signers at least 24 hours in advance if you expect to be unavailable or unable to sign transactions for any period.</li>\n<li><strong>Report Key Issues:</strong> Notify other signers and the Arbitrum Foundation via email immediately if you lose access to your signing keys or suspect they have been compromised.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-setting-up-a-multi-sig-wallet-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-setting-up-a-multi-sig-wallet-2\"></a>Setting Up a Multi-Sig Wallet</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initial Communication:</strong> All signers should exchange email communications and share a signed message from the key to be installed. The message should include:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum account address: “[signer address]\"</li>\n<li>A statement identifying the signer and the multi-sig wallet they are joining: “[Message: I am X and I am joining the Y multi-sig]\"</li>\n<li>Signature hash: ”[signature]\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Key Authentication:</strong> Conduct 1-to-1 and group calls among signers to authenticate the signing key with the owner. Do not rely solely on Telegram for key authentication.</li>\n<li><strong>Clawback of Funds:</strong> As the ultimate owner of its funds, the ArbitrumDAO should be able to clawback funds from any of its multi-sigs by executing a respective Tally proposal - which can be enabled if multi-sigs are set up using the Zodiac Governor Module, for example.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-adhering-to-terms-and-conditions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-adhering-to-terms-and-conditions-3\"></a>Adhering to Terms and Conditions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Review Proposals Carefully:</strong> Always review the respective on-chain Tally proposal before disbursing any funds, as they are the source of truth for payment schedules, payment caps, recipients, and other important details. If you have doubts, please reach out to the DAO Relations team at the Arbitrum Foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>Follow Agreements:</strong> Abide by the terms and conditions of any agreements made with the Arbitrum Foundation. For example, only sign transactions to distribute funds which (a) have been approved by the ARB Community per the Tally proposals, (b) have satisfied appropriate compliance measures (such as know-your-customer checks) and documentation (as applicable) as confirmed by Foundation and (c) comply with the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\">ArbitrumDAO Constitution</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> If there is a conflict among proposals regarding fund disbursement, contact the Arbitrum Foundation for guidance.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance Confirmation:</strong> Never disburse funds without receiving confirmation from the Arbitrum Foundation that all compliance and necessary background work have been completed.</li>\n<li><strong>Recipient Detail Changes:</strong> If a recipient needs to update any details (e.g. the address for receiving funds), they must contact the Arbitrum Foundation to restart the compliance process before any payments can be made.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-communication-protocol-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-communication-protocol-4\"></a>Communication Protocol</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Telegram Group:</strong> Establish a Telegram group that includes all signers and members from the Arbitrum Foundation’s DAO Relations team.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-channel Communication:</strong> Do not rely solely on Telegram. Regularly speak with fellow signers through calls to ensure clear communication.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction Request Template:</strong> When requesting signatures, use a consistent template. This could either be through a bot (e.g. Onchain Den) or a manual template that includes:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Nonce</li>\n<li>Payment details</li>\n<li>Amount</li>\n<li>Compliance status</li>\n<li>Multi-sig wallet name (avoid using links)</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Transparent Queuing:</strong> For greater transparency, the person queuing the transaction can record a Loom video of the process and share it with the other signers.</li>\n<li><strong>Record Keeping:</strong> Maintain a shared record of payments made (e.g. on Google Sheets) with version history that tracks:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Recipient name</li>\n<li>Recipient address</li>\n<li>Payment amount</li>\n<li>Compliance completion status</li>\n<li>Recipient address confirmation</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Transaction Confirmation:</strong> Signers should confirm on their Telegram group when they have signed or executed a transaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Periodic Reporting:</strong> Publish transaction summaries on the DAO forum at regular intervals (e.g. monthly) to maintain transparency.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-notification-process-between-arbitrum-foundation-and-signers-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-notification-process-between-arbitrum-foundation-and-signers-5\"></a>Notification Process Between Arbitrum Foundation and Signers</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>KYC Completion:</strong> ‘Recipient A’ completes KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>Notification:</strong> The Arbitrum Foundation informs ‘Multi-Sig A’ via email that ‘Recipient A’ is eligible for payment.</li>\n<li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> ‘Multi-Sig A’ acknowledges the update with the Arbitrum Foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>Address Verification:</strong> ‘Multi-Sig A’ verifies with ‘Recipient A’ that they control the KYC-approved address by requesting an on-chain signature, and sharing this proof over email.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction Queuing:</strong> ‘Multi-Sig A’ queues the transaction (or batch of transactions) and shares the details with other signers using a transaction form template, Onchain Den bot, Google Sheet, and/or Loom video.</li>\n<li><strong>Signer Communication:</strong> Signers coordinate and confirm when they have signed the transaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution Notification:</strong> Once the transaction is executed, ‘Multi-Sig A’ communicates this update to the Foundation and the DAO via the forum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58237-key-terms-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58237-key-terms-6\"></a>Key Terms:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet:</strong> Wallet that requires multiple private key signatures to execute transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Signer:</strong> Member of a multi-sig wallet</li>\n<li><strong>Hardware wallet:</strong> Physical device (often resembling a USB pen), that securely stores private keys, offline.</li>\n<li><strong>Seed phrase:</strong> Sequence of random words that stores the data required to access or recover private keys</li>\n<li><strong>Signer address:</strong> The public address (an ENS or a randomly generated string of numbers and letters), like an email address, of a member of a multi-sig wallet</li>\n<li><strong>(Private) key:</strong> Randomly generated string of letters and numbers, like a password, that allows a respective signer to sign and execute transactions</li>\n<li><strong>Payment address:</strong> Address of a member of a multi-sig wallet used to receive compensation</li>\n<li><strong>Recipient:</strong> A DAO stakeholder who receives funding from a DAO-related multi-sig</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post -

This initiative will solidify the university’s engagement with Arbitrum and establish a delegation focus within the university, allowing students and faculty to actively participate in governance and ecosystem initiatives.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Arbitrum LATAM’s next academic collaboration will take place in September 2024 at <a href=\"https://get.ucema.edu.ar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><strong>UCEMA</strong></a>, a prestigious university in Argentina. This collaboration marks the continued expansion of Arbitrum’s academic partnerships, as the team looks to strengthen ties with key educational institutions in the region.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the team is actively pursuing new partnerships with universities in Chile and Uruguay, with plans to finalize agreements by the end of Q4 2024. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to expand Arbitrum’s presence across Latin America, fostering education and adoption of the Arbitrum ecosystem in the region.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58185-partnerships-and-participations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58185-partnerships-and-participations-5\"></a>Partnerships and Participations</h3>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum Day Collab with the Arbitrum Foundation</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/957f1adcf47967f77d403105f750e2a7a43bf10c.png\" alt=\"ADAY\" data-base62-sha1=\"lkvsMeOUFnR6mUTi9BWadDVAaJK\" width=\"398\" height=\"398\"></p>\n<p>At the Arbitrum Day event, we began with a detailed introduction to the Arbitrum ecosystem, explaining its structure, purpose, and how it is helping scale Ethereum through Layer 2 solutions. We emphasized Arbitrum’s critical role in reducing transaction costs and improving network efficiency. The presentation was well received, particularly by those new to the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Following that, we participated in a panel discussion alongside delegates and ambassadors from the Arbitrum protocol. During this panel, we discussed the various ways community members can engage with the ecosystem, whether through governance participation using the ARB token or by contributing to projects on the network. We also touched on topics related to decentralization and security, explaining how the community plays a key role in decision-making through proposals and voting.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we worked closely with the Arbitrum Foundation’s ambassadors to provide a guide on how to interpret the ecosystem’s metrics.

However, the tally vote earmarked 100k ARB as payment to program manager for one year (which converted to $86,581) while Steakhouse quoted a fee of $174,000 in their application. This proposal seeks input on the right way forward, with the options to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approve only a 6 month contract from available funds</li>\n<li>Earmark additional funds so they complete their one year tenure</li>\n<li>Not have a program manager, which will result in liquidation of the RWAs and</li>\n<li>Conduct a new RFP to select a  program manager for one year at $86,581</li>\n<li>Abstain</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong> - On April 10th 2024, the DAO <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">approved</a> 35 million ARB for diversification into RWAs. Of this, 100,000 ARB was budgeted for the role of program manager. The Arbitrum Foundation got an average price of 87 cents per ARB, resulting in $86,581 to pay the program manager.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/af2547aad4c9a618e8dddf678b3f2d9997026125.jpeg\" alt=\"conversino\" data-base62-sha1=\"oZpqC3ftcOtE8cPnHpfpFBsaPnT\" width=\"594\" height=\"188\"></p>\n<p>In their <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/steakhouse-financial-step-program-manager/23829\">application</a>, Steakhouse quoted $174,000 per year. Given the funds received from the 100,000 ARB sale ($86,531) are less than the amount necessary to pay for a full year of the Program Manager’s services, we need to either shorten their term to 6 months or approve an additional 6 months pay (from yield earned via the program). We can also declare the earlier election null and void while putting out a call for program managers willing to serve at $86,581 for a year. If there is no program manager to oversee investments, assets are liquidated and returned to the DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> - While writing the Tally proposal, I budgeted 100k ARB for the program manager role based on a quotation received from another provider and the prevailing ARB price at the time.</p>\n<p>Steakhouse financial and the other applicants prepared a budget in dollar value, not ARB. As a result, i under-budgeted the program manager role in the STEP program and now need approval from the DAO on provisioning either a shortened tenure of 6 months or additional funding to complete the one year. The additional funds will be requested from the yield earned on the RWAs (estimated at between $1-2 million per year) to prevent ARB liquidations. Alternatively, we can hold a new RFP seeking program managers at a fixed price of $86,581 for the year and invalidate the earlier election.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong> - The STEP program is one of the largest diversification initiatives at any DAO, seeking to diversify our treasury while simultaneously growing the RWA ecosystem. Given the complications that can arise in managing the large sums of money, it is imperative that the DAO have a capable program manager to recommend liquidations,conduct firedrills, monitor interest payments to the DAO treasury, and track underlying changes in service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong> -  After ratification of their role as STEP program manager and whether it is 6 months or 1 year, the Arbitrum foundation will sign an agreement with Steakhouse Financial and begin investments into selected RWA providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong> -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Post on forum</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upload on Snapshot (Thursday, 12th September)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Foundation negotiates agreement with Steakhouse and pays the first 6 months of their payment from the initial 100,000 ARB budgeted for in the STEP proposal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After RWA yield is returned to the treasury, this proposal is taken to Tally requesting balance of $87,419  (provided one year tenure is approved in the snapshot)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong> - If the entire one year tenure is ratified, the cost to the DAO is $87,419. If 6 month tenure is approved, the cost is needing another election for program manager in a shortened time. If the proposal is rejected, we liquidate all $30 million and return assets to the DAO. If a new RFP is held seeking program manager services for $86,581 for a year, we delay the start of the STEP program and possibly get a less capable pool of applicants at the lower price point.</p>\n<p>Work done in shepherding this proposal is paid for through a Thrivecoin firestarter grant to the Arbitrum treasury and sustainability group.</p>\n            <p><small>7 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-terms-of-tenure-for-step-program-manager/26675\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-terms-of-tenure-for-step-program-manager/26675","pubDate":"Sat, 07 Sep 2024 07:59:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26675"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-terms-of-tenure-for-step-program-manager/26675.rss","#text":"**Non-Constitutional: Terms of Tenure for STEP Program Manager**"},"filter":false},{"title":"Stylus SDK Audit","dc:creator":"openzeppelin","category":"General","description":"<p>At the request of the Arbitrum Foundation, OpenZeppelin audited Offchain Lab’s Stylus SDK.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Type:   Smart Contract Language</p>\n<p>Timeline:   From 2024-07-08 To 2024-08-09</p>\n<p>Languages:   Rust</p>\n<p>Total Issues:   36 (27 resolved, 1 partially resolved)</p>\n<p>Critical Severity Issues:   2 (1 resolved, 1 partially resolved)</p>\n<p>High Severity Issues:   2 (2 resolved)</p>\n<p>Medium Severity Issues:   10 (7 resolved)</p>\n<p>Low Severity Issues:   12 (8 resolved)</p>\n<p>Notes &amp; Additional Information:   10 (9 resolved)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-scope-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-scope-2\"></a>Scope</h2>\n<p>We audited the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs</a> repository at commit <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/tree/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">62bd831</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In scope were the following files:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">stylus-proc\n└── src\n    ├── calls\n    │   └── mod.rs\n    ├── lib.rs\n    ├── methods\n    │   ├── entrypoint.rs\n    │   ├── error.rs\n    │   ├── external.rs\n    │   └── mod.rs\n    ├── storage\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   └── proc.rs\n    └── types.rs\nstylus-sdk\n└── src\n    ├── abi\n    │   ├── bytes.rs\n    │   ├── const_string.rs\n    │   ├── export\n    │   │   ├── internal.rs\n    │   │   └── mod.rs\n    │   ├── impls.rs\n    │   ├── internal.rs\n    │   └── mod.rs\n    ├── block.rs\n    ├── call\n    │   ├── context.rs\n    │   ├── error.rs\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   ├── raw.rs\n    │   ├── traits.rs\n    │   └── transfer.rs\n    ├── contract.rs\n    ├── crypto.rs\n    ├── debug.rs\n    ├── deploy\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   └── raw.rs\n    ├── evm.rs\n    ├── hostio.rs\n    ├── lib.rs\n    ├── msg.rs\n    ├── prelude.rs\n    ├── storage\n    │   ├── array.rs\n    │   ├── bytes.rs\n    │   ├── map.rs\n    │   ├── mod.rs\n    │   ├── traits.rs\n    │   └── vec.rs\n    ├── tx.rs\n    ├── types.rs\n    └── util.rs\nexamples\n├── erc20\n│   └── src\n│       ├── erc20.rs\n│       ├── lib.rs\n│       └── main.rs\n├── erc721\n│   └── src\n│       ├── erc721.rs\n│       ├── lib.rs\n│       └── main.rs\n└── single_call\n    └── src\n        ├── lib.rs\n        └── main.rs\nmini-alloc\n├── src\n│   ├── imp.rs\n│   └── lib.rs\n└── tests\n    └── misc.rs\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-system-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-system-overview-3\"></a>System Overview</h2>\n<p>Arbitrum Stylus introduces a paradigm shift in smart contract development by enabling programs to be compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and deployed on-chain, seamlessly coexisting with traditional smart contracts written in common EVM languages like Solidity. This language-agnostic approach opens up new possibilities for developers, enabling them to use their preferred programming languages while maintaining full ABI compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Stylus programs is their exceptional performance and cost-effectiveness. These programs are orders of magnitude cheaper and faster to execute than traditional EVM-based smart contracts while also being fully EVM compatible. This breakthrough enables Stylus programs to interact seamlessly with existing Ethereum smart contracts, creating a bridge between the efficiency of WASM and the established Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-stylus-sdk-for-rust-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-stylus-sdk-for-rust-4\"></a>Stylus SDK for Rust</h3>\n<p>This powerful toolkit enables developers to write programs for Arbitrum chains in Rust. Rust’s combination of performance, safety, and modern features makes it ideal for developing robust and efficient smart contracts. The Stylus SDK for Rust provides a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions that simplify the process of creating Stylus programs. It offers a familiar development experience for Rust programmers while integrating seamlessly with the Arbitrum ecosystem. Some of the features available in the SDK include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generic, storage-backed Rust types for programming Solidity-equivalent smart contracts with optimal storage caching.</li>\n<li>Simple macros for writing language-agnostic methods and entry points.</li>\n<li>Automatic export of Solidity interfaces for interoperability across programming languages.</li>\n<li>Powerful primitive types backed by the feature-rich Alloy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-procedural-macros-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-procedural-macros-5\"></a>Procedural Macros</h2>\n<p>The Stylus Rust SDK leverages several powerful procedural macros to streamline smart contract development and ensure seamless integration with the EVM ecosystem. These macros automate complex tasks such as trait implementation, method exposure, storage management, and inter-contract communication, allowing developers to write idiomatic Rust code while maintaining full compatibility with contracts made with EVM-compatible languages.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-entrypoint-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-entrypoint-6\"></a><code>entrypoint</code></h3>\n<p>This macro defines the entry point for Stylus execution. It implements the <code>TopLevelStorage</code> trait and is typically used to annotate the top-level storage struct. This macro sets up the necessary boilerplate for handling incoming calls, parsing calldata, and serializing results. It also manages reentrancy protection, integrating with the Stylus VM’s execution model.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-external-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-external-7\"></a><code>external</code></h3>\n<p>This macro is used to make methods “external” so that they can be called by other contracts. It implements the <code>Router</code> trait for the annotated <code>impl</code> block. The macro handles the complexities of ABI encoding and decoding, method selector generation, and integration with the Stylus VM’s calling conventions. It also manages purity annotations (<code>pure</code>, <code>view</code>, <code>payable</code>) and can infer these based on the method signature if not explicitly specified. This macro can have the <code>#[inherit]</code> attribute to implement inheritance-like behavior, allowing a contract to include methods from parent contracts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-sol_interface-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-sol_interface-8\"></a><code>sol_interface</code></h3>\n<p>It transforms Solidity interface definitions into Rust structs and methods, enabling seamless interaction with other contracts. The macro handles method generation, type conversion, function selector calculation, and call context management. It supports various call types (<code>pure</code>, <code>view</code>, and <code>payable</code>) and accommodates reentrancy concerns. By automating the creation of ABI-compatible Rust code, it simplifies cross-contract communication while maintaining type safety and idiomatic Rust practices. This macro acts as a translator, enabling Rust contracts to integrate with the broader EVM ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-solidity_storage-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-solidity_storage-9\"></a><code>solidity_storage</code></h3>\n<p>This attribute macro is applied to Rust structs to enable their use in persistent storage within a smart contract. Each field in the struct must implement the <code>StorageType</code> trait which ensures EVM storage model compatibility. Applying this macro allows developers to define storage layouts directly in Rust, with the fields mapping to the corresponding storage slots in the EVM. This macro ensures that the storage layout of the Rust structs aligns with that of Solidity, facilitating seamless upgrades and interactions with existing Solidity contracts. It supports nested structs and various storage types like <code>StorageAddress</code>, <code>StorageBool</code>, and custom types implementing <code>StorageType</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-sol_storage-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-sol_storage-10\"></a><code>sol_storage</code></h3>\n<p>This macro enables the definition of Rust structs using Solidity-like syntax. It ensures that the storage layout of these structs is identical to their Solidity counterparts. This macro simplifies the transition from Solidity to Rust by allowing developers to reuse their Solidity type definitions directly in Rust, maintaining compatibility with existing storage layouts. This macro uses <code>solidity_storage</code> macro under the hood.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-derive_solidity_error-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-derive_solidity_error-11\"></a><code>derive_solidity_error</code></h3>\n<p>This macro allows Rust enums to be used for error handling in contract methods. It enables enums to be automatically converted into Solidity-compatible error messages that can be returned by smart contract functions. Under the hood, the macro works by implementing <code>From&lt;YOUR_ERROR&gt;</code> for <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> along with printing code for <code>export-abi</code>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-derive_erase-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-derive_erase-12\"></a><code>derive_erase</code></h3>\n<p>This macro automatically implements the <code>Erase</code> trait for a struct. It generates an <code>erase()</code> method that calls <code>erase()</code> on each of the struct’s fields. This allows for easy clearing of complex storage structures in Arbitrum Stylus smart contracts, ensuring that all fields are properly erased without manual implementation. The macro cannot implement Erase for types that do not support it, such as mappings.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-core-modules-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-core-modules-13\"></a>Core Modules</h2>\n<p>The following modules are contained within the <code>stylus-sdk</code> folder to facilitate smart contract development and interaction with the Stylus WASM module:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-abi-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-abi-14\"></a><code>abi</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>abi</code> module provides functionality for encoding and decoding data according to the Ethereum Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification. It enables a two-way mapping between Solidity and Rust types, allowing for interoperability between Rust and Solidity contracts. The module supports encoding function calls into byte arrays and decoding contract responses back into Rust types. The <code>abi</code> module also includes utilities to generate method selectors and export Solidity interfaces, treating <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> as <code>uint8[]</code> in Solidity and using the <code>Bytes</code> type for Solidity <code>bytes</code>. This functionality is essential for communication between Rust-based smart contracts and those written in Solidity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-call-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-call-15\"></a><code>call</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>call</code> module manages interactions with external contracts by handling the execution context and providing mechanisms for standard and raw contract calls. It allows developers to specify gas limits and call values, and access contract storage. The module includes caching strategies to optimize repeated state access and features for safe execution during re-entrant calls. By managing these aspects, the <code>call</code> module enables Rust-based contracts to interact with Ethereum contracts, facilitating contract communication and data exchange.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-deploy-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-deploy-16\"></a><code>deploy</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>deploy</code> module facilitates the deployment of contracts on the Arbitrum network. It includes functionalities for both standard and raw deployments, offering flexibility and control over the deployment process. The <code>raw.rs</code> file provides lower-level deployment functions, allowing for more granular control and potentially unsafe operations. This module supports setting deployment parameters, handling the deployment process, and ensuring correct contract initialization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-storage-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-storage-17\"></a><code>storage</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>storage</code> module provides a comprehensive framework for managing smart contract storage, featuring abstractions for common data structures like arrays, bytes, maps, and vectors. It supports both basic and complex storage operations through a set of defined traits, ensuring proper data handling and access. The module allows developers to define custom storage logic by implementing the <code>StorageType</code> trait, enabling more advanced data manipulation while providing persistent storage access in the Rust-based contracts. Stylus contracts run on a virtual machine that shares the same EVM State Trie, allowing access to Ethereum’s key-value storage. The module provides types and traits for safe storage access using Rust’s borrow checker, preventing unsafe aliasing of storage.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-hostio-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-hostio-18\"></a><code>hostio</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>hostio</code> module facilitates interactions between Rust-based smart contracts and the host environment on the Arbitrum blockchain. It provides a set of functions for managing contract state, executing calls, and handling I/O operations via a foreign-function interface to the Stylus WASM VM which ultimately communicates with the core blockchain. The <code>wrap_hostio</code> macro is a key component of this module, designed to simplify and streamline the process of defining host functions. It wraps low-level host operations in Rust-safe abstractions, automatically generating bindings to interact with the blockchain. Several single-file modules in the Stylus SDK provide typical blockchain interactions extensively using the <code>wrap_hostio</code> module, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>block</code></strong>: Provides access to Ethereum block information, including properties like the block number, timestamp, and miner details. It serves as an interface for retrieving data about the current or past blocks on the blockchain.</li>\n<li><strong><code>contract</code></strong>: Facilitates interactions with other contracts, enabling function calls and access to contract metadata. It allows contracts to perform operations such as balance checks and contract code retrieval.</li>\n<li><strong><code>crypto</code></strong>: Offers cryptographic functions and utilities, such as hashing algorithms and signature verification.</li>\n<li><strong><code>evm</code></strong>: Interfaces with the EVM, managing execution resources and logging. It includes utilities to query remaining gas and ink (Stylus-specific compute units), emit logs both in raw and alloy-typed forms, and manage memory growth.</li>\n<li><strong><code>msg</code></strong>: Handles message-passing operations, providing information about the current transaction, such as the sender, value, and gas. It allows contracts to interact with transaction data and control flow.</li>\n<li><strong><code>tx</code></strong>: Provides transaction-related functionality, including accessing transaction details like gas price and origin. It enables contracts to work with transaction-specific data and execute transaction-based logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-mini-allocator-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-mini-allocator-19\"></a>Mini Allocator</h2>\n<p>This allocator is key to the Stylus ecosystem, optimized for wasm32 targets like Arbitrum Stylus. It uses a minimal bump allocator strategy, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency. Notably, mini-alloc never deallocates memory, which is ideal for scenarios with tight binary size constraints where it is acceptable to leak all allocations. This design choice enhances performance, aligning with Stylus’ focus on optimizing for blockchain environments where traditional memory management can add unnecessary overhead.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-examples-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-examples-20\"></a>Examples</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum Stylus SDK repository contains three example crates of common smart contract designs: <code>erc20</code>, <code>erc721</code>, and <code>single_call</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>erc20</code></strong>: Demonstrates an ERC-20 token contract with functionalities like minting, transferring, and checking balances. It includes methods for token transfers and managing allowances.</li>\n<li><strong><code>erc721</code></strong>: Illustrates an ERC-721 NFT contract implementation, covering minting, transferring, and querying ownership of unique tokens. It also handles token metadata and ensures compatibility with the ERC-721 standard.</li>\n<li><strong><code>single_cal</code></strong>: Showcases a simple contract for making a single call to another contract, demonstrating inter-contract communication within the Arbitrum environment using the Stylus SDK.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-trust-assumptions-21\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-trust-assumptions-21\"></a>Trust Assumptions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SDK Integrity</strong>: It is assumed that the Stylus SDK itself is free from malicious code, such as backdoors or other vulnerabilities that could circumvent the behavior of the underlying blockchain. The SDK is expected to function as described in its documentation, ensuring that developers can rely on its behavior as intended.</li>\n<li><strong>WASM VM and Stylus Module Compliance</strong>: It is assumed that the WASM VM and Stylus module strictly follow the consensus rules as outlined by the core EVM part of Arbitrum. This ensures that the execution within the Stylus environment is consistent with the broader consensus rules governing the Arbitrum network, maintaining the integrity and reliability of smart contract execution.</li>\n<li><strong>Third-Party Dependencies</strong>: Any third-party libraries or dependencies integrated with the Stylus SDK are trusted to be secure and regularly updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart Contract Interfaces</strong>: It is assumed that the ABIs generated by the Stylus SDK for contracts are correct and that smart contracts behave in an expected manner, similar to Solidity contracts. This means that from an external perspective, the contracts should exhibit predictable and standard behavior, ensuring compatibility and reliability for the users interacting with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-critical-severity-22\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-critical-severity-22\"></a>Critical Severity</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-storage-layout-is-inconsistent-with-solidity-23\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-storage-layout-is-inconsistent-with-solidity-23\"></a>Storage Layout is Inconsistent with Solidity</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/rust-sdk-guide#sol_storage\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documentation</a> asserts that struct fields in Stylus will map to the same storage slots as in EVM programming languages and that the layout will be identical to <a href=\"https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Solidity’s</a>. This suggests that upgrading from Solidity to Rust should not cause misalignment in storage slots, thereby implying an easy transfer of type definitions.</p>\n<p>However, Stylus does not handle inherited storage in the same manner as Solidity. For example, consider the following Solidity code:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"solidity\"><code class=\"lang-solidity\">contract Parent {\n   bool a = true;\n   bool b = true;\n}\ncontract Child is Parent {\n   bool c = true;\n   bool d = true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, storage slot 0 contains <code>0x01010101</code>. In contrast, the equivalent Stylus code uses a <code>borrow</code> clause that uses a new storage slot and does not pack the state variables, which results in a different storage layout:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"rust\"><code class=\"lang-rust\">// Snippet of parent.rs\nsol_storage! {\n    pub struct Parent {\n        bool a;\n        bool b;\n    }\n}\n\n// Snippet of lib.rs\nsol_storage! {   \n    #[entrypoint]\n    struct Child {\n        #[borrow]\n        Parent parent;\n        bool c; \n        bool d;\n    }\n}\n\n#[external]\n#[inherit(Parent)]\nimpl Child {\n// ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Given the same value set, this results in <code>0x0101</code> being in slot 0 and <code>0x0101</code> being in slot 1.</p>\n<p>This discrepancy is critical for projects using proxy patterns that are migrating from Solidity to Stylus as it could lead to storage layout misalignment, potentially overwriting state variables.</p>\n<p>Consider refactoring the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06/stylus-proc/src/storage/mod.rs#L12\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>solidity_storage</code> macro</a> to mirror Solidity’s behavior. Alternatively, consider updating the documentation to accurately reflect the current behavior and avoid misleading developers.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Resolved at commits <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/commit/a99d8c5abed54dfdba8e91c9cc9c5c024dd76495\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a99d8c5</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs/commit/6e3a62ea291c3e9e47ef3c1d4f3e5a065ad7f997\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">6e3a62e</a>.

To achieve this, it analyzes an implementation block, processes each method to generate its selectors, and then uses these selectors to route incoming calls to the appropriate Rust functions.</p>\n<p>However, the macro does not validate the uniqueness of these selectors. This oversight can lead to selector collisions, resulting in methods becoming unreachable. In addition, developers can manually set a custom selector for a function using <code>#[selector(id = &lt;NUMBER_THAT_GENERATES_THE_COLLISION&gt;)]</code>, potentially duplicating existing selectors intentionally or unintentionally. This vulnerability can be exploited to create malicious contracts, such as honeypots, wherein methods are intentionally made unreachable.</p>\n<p>Consider implementing a validation mechanism within this macro to ensure that all selectors are unique, preventing selector collisions and enhancing contract reliability and security. One approach could be to add a <code>#[deny(unreachable_patterns)]</code> statement on the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06/stylus-proc/src/methods/external.rs#L274\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>route</code></a> function to prevent unreachable methods.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Partially resolved at commits <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/commit/a78decd745e2580f57de5cc38bec093842e51e92\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">a78decd</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/commit/0d50c1daf06ff2175d8a58dd4ec91799defb890b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0d50c1d</a>. The suggested solution of using <code>#[deny(unreachable_patterns)]</code> is insufficient, as it only checks for unreachable patterns within the specific match statement where it is applied. It does not account for selector collisions with functions from inherited contracts, allowing these conflicts to go undetected. Offchain Labs has added inline documentation to highlight this potential issue, and warnings will also be included on the documentation website. The Offchain Labs team is exploring alternative approaches to implementing inheritance for Stylus.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58099-high-severity-25\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-high-severity-25\"></a>High Severity</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-potential-misuse-of-sol_interface-macro-26\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-potential-misuse-of-sol_interface-macro-26\"></a>Potential Misuse of <code>sol_interface</code> Macro</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06/stylus-proc/src/calls/mod.rs#L13\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>sol_interface</code></a> macro allows developers to seamlessly call Solidity contracts from Stylus smart contracts using their native interfaces.

This feature facilitates changing the name of a function while maintaining the same selector, simulating Solidity overloading capabilities and enabling the creation of language-agnostic contract standards.</p>\n<p>However, providing an <code>ID</code> may result in a function selector that exists in both an implementation contract and its proxy contract. Thus, a user may call a proxy contract function with a selector matching the intended implementation contract function instead, causing unintended code execution and precluding the user from accessing the functionality of the implementation contract. This scenario can occur if an <code>ID</code> integer is defined in such a way that, when converted to hex, it matches the function selector in the other contract, whether it is the implementation or the proxy.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability enables malicious projects to create hard-to-detect backdoors. In contrast to Stylus, Solidity requires finding function signatures with matching selectors before exploiting this vulnerability, which is not trivial. Even if such function signatures are found, they are likely to raise red flags due to nonsensical names in the codebase. In Stylus, this attack is harder to execute when the <code>name</code> option is used instead of <code>ID</code> which makes such scams easier to detect.</p>\n<p>Custom selectors can also confuse third-party monitoring or indexing services that use function selectors to identify specific functions. These services may rely on standard selectors, which are part of the standards or belong to community databases such as the <a href=\"https://www.4byte.directory/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">4byte directory</a>. If contracts use custom selectors, these services may fail to recognize and monitor transactions, leading to errors.</p>\n<p>Given these risks, reconsider the <code>ID</code> option and consider accepting only the <code>name</code> instead.

This enhancement would simplify array handling and reduce the risk of errors.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Resolved at commit <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/commit/8ab76505ccb996e22443b42b45b61526598bac62\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">8ab7650</a>.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-unresolved-link-to-eagerstorage-58\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-unresolved-link-to-eagerstorage-58\"></a>Unresolved Link to <code>EagerStorage</code></h3>\n<p>The link to <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06/stylus-sdk/src/storage/traits.rs#L179\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>super::EagerStorage</code></a> in <code>traits.rs</code> is broken as no item named <code>EagerStorage</code> exists in the <code>storage</code> module.</p>\n<p>Consider updating or removing the broken link to ensure accurate documentation and avoid confusion for developers.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Resolved at commit <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/commit/9b221c88fa077f49c08ca657a420c917330a71e4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">9b221c8</a>.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-typographical-errors-59\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-typographical-errors-59\"></a>Typographical Errors</h3>\n<p>Throughout the codebase, multiple instances of typographical errors were identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06/stylus-proc/src/methods/external.rs#L260\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>inheritence</code></a> should be <code>inheritance</code>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06/stylus-sdk/src/hostio.rs#L75\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>occured</code></a> should be <code>occurred</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider fixing the aforementioned typographical errors in order to improve the readability of the codebase.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Resolved at commit <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/commit/5052d308f98525a32b06319b1f47f4ab296ef6f1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">5052d30</a>.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58099-external-macro-attribute-handling-inconsistency-60\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58099-external-macro-attribute-handling-inconsistency-60\"></a>External Macro Attribute Handling Inconsistency</h3>\n<p>The external macro currently <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/62bd8318c7f3ab5be954cbc264f85bf2ba3f4b06/stylus-proc/src/methods/external.rs#L19\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">accepts attributes</a> that are not utilized in its implementation.

These Stylus programs are compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and can be deployed on-chain to run alongside Solidity smart contracts. This innovative approach aims to combine the efficiency of WASM execution with the robustness of programming in Rust, all the while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</p>\n<p>During the security audit of the Stylus SDK, we discovered numerous security issues and also made extensive recommendations for the improvement of the overall design. The project is clearly still under development, having several features that are either non-functional or contain bugs. However, the development team showed a strong commitment to addressing these concerns and we encourage them to continue their efforts. Once all the identified issues are resolved, further improvements are made, and the project reaches a more mature stage, we strongly recommend the team to consider conducting a follow-up audit to ensure comprehensive security.</p>\n<p>Despite the current challenges, we see great potential in the Stylus SDK. We look forward to seeing how the project evolves, particularly as the team addresses the identified issues and continues to refine the SDK. We believe that further development of the Stylus SDK could introduce exciting new possibilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem and the broader world of smart contract development.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sdk-audit/26674\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sdk-audit/26674","pubDate":"Sat, 07 Sep 2024 03:19:27 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26674"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sdk-audit/26674.rss","#text":"Stylus SDK Audit"},"filter":false},{"title":"Delegate Incentive Program Results (AUGUST 2024)","dc:creator":"SEEDGov","category":"Delegate Incentives Program","description":"<p>We are proud to announce the initial outcomes of the fifth month of the Delegate Incentive Program.

href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/enhancing-multichain-governance-upgrading-rari-governance-token-on-arbitrum/26096\">Rari multichain governance proposal</a> and its specifications. If enacted, the proposal execution will register a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract that will migrate the RARI DAO from the Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The <a href=\"https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">new token contract</a> has been fully audited and deployed to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet and all contracts have been manually tested.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-overview-2\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>The $RARI token that is used to govern the RARI DAO is currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradeable. However, the RARI DAO would like to upgrade its governance to allow for new features to be implemented such as snapshots and delegations. By bringing its governance to the Arbitrum ecosystem, RARI DAO would also improve the user experience through lower gas fees and increased accessibility of their system. Despite the non-upgradeability of the $RARI token, it is possible to make these changes to the governance model by using a custom gateway to register a new token contract. This proposed solution requires the Arbitrum DAO’s approval.</p>\n<p>Despite the non-upgradeability of the $RARI token, it is possible to make these changes to the governance model by using a custom gateway to register a new token contract. This proposed solution requires the Arbitrum DAO’s approval.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-57970-custom-gateway-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-custom-gateway-motivation-3\"></a>Custom Gateway Motivation</h4>\n<p>The Arbitrum chain allows for tokens to be bridged between various networks, such as between Arbitrum and Ethereum. In the case of many ERC-20 tokens, this involves associating a token contract on some other chain with a paired token contract on Arbitrum. When users wish to bridge their tokens, the tokens are escrowed in a bridge contract on the host chain, and an equal amount of tokens is minted on Arbitrum. Using <code>StandardERC20Gateway</code>, any ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainnet can be permissionlessly bridged to Arbitrum by default. However, this standard approach is not suitable for some tokens. For example, tokens accruing interest need to ensure that the rewards are dispersed properly to other chains instead of just being accrued to the bridge contract. A <strong>custom gateway system</strong> allows for specialized cross-chain asset bridging in such exceptional cases where additional bridging logic is necessary to be implemented.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum generic-custom gateway is designed as a flexible solution that is suitable for most custom needs beyond what is available using <code>StandardERC20Gateway</code>. In the case of the new $RARI token, the proposed changes include the addition of snapshotting and delegation functions, as well as the introduction of proxy-based upgradeability. According to the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum Foundation documentation</a>, this is likely the right solution for such a migration since these changes are limited in scope (as opposed to the addition of minting functionality directly on Arbitrum, for example).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-technical-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-technical-details-4\"></a>Technical Details</h3>\n<p>In order to register the new $RARI token to the custom gateway, <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the relevant steps</a> are outlined by the Arbitrum Foundation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Deploy your token on Arbitrum</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The new $RARI token deployed on Arbitrum should conform to the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/IArbToken.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">IArbToken</a> interface, as in the following <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/L2GatewayToken.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">example implementation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Register your token on L1 to your token on L2 via the <code>L1CustomGateway</code> contract</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The $RARI token currently deployed on the Ethereum mainnet should make an external call to <code>L1CustomGateway.registerTokenToL2</code>.

The mapping between the tokens deployed on the mainnet and the Arbitrum chain would then be updated and the RARI token would be registered to the generic-custom gateway, completing the remaining two steps in the registration process.</p>\n<p>The upgraded token contract from the proposal has also been <a href=\"https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fully audited</a>.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57970-conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57970-conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The proposed changes, including registration of a new $RARI token to the generic-custom gateway, are appropriate to meet the needs of the RARI DAO. Since the currently deployed contracts are non-upgradeable and the RARI DAO wishes to add new features to their token, as well as enhance user experience, this operation is necessary. Using the standard ERC-20 gateway would not support the new desired enhancements and the changes do not require a unique, tailor-made gateway. Registering with the generic-custom gateway is a good fit for this transition.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648","pubDate":"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 18:59:25 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26648"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rari-multichain-governance-proposal-security-review/26648.rss","#text":"RARI Multichain Governance Proposal Security Review"},"filter":false},{"title":"Lampros Labs DAO Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"Euphoria","category":"Delegate Statements","description":"<p><strong>Delegate Address:</strong> 0xA2D590FEe197C0b614Fe7c3E10303327F38C0dc3<br>\n<strong>Team Member Handles:</strong> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/blueweb\">@Blueweb</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/euphoria\">@Euphoria</a> &amp; <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/nyx\">@Nyx</a><br>\n<strong>Tally Profile:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xa2d590fee197c0b614fe7c3e10303327f38c0dc3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a><br>\n<strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://lamproslabs.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a><br>\n<strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/lamproslabsdao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lampros Labs DAO</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Delegate Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Lampros Labs DAO is an open community of builders and governance enthusiasts committed to transparency, decentralization, and inclusivity.

While this has many benefits, it can also pose challenges in running a fair election such as electing security council members.</p>\n<p>Some of the solutions discussed below will require a direct integration into the governor while others can be supported through an integration with Flexible Voting. Both of these paths would require a governor upgrade, however an upgrade to the Core and Treasury Governors which includes Flexible Voting has already been planned for later this month.</p>\n<p>In no particular order, we evaluated five existing private voting solutions and explored three avenues of creating a new private voting solutions using relevant privacy tools. We assessed each solution by analyzing their potential tradeoffs, implementation feasibility, and effort needed to incorporate them into a DAO governance structure.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-assessment-factors-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-assessment-factors-3\"></a>Assessment Factors</h2>\n<p>To prevent major delegates from influencing election and voting results, we considered hiding the identity of the voter as the most important factor in our assessment.  Several other key factors were also considered in assessing each privacy solution:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ballot privacy: Whether the vote preference of a voter is revealed.</li>\n<li>Tallying transparency and correctness: Whether the vote is tallied in a decentralized and transparent manner</li>\n<li>Optionality and verifiability: If the voter has the choice of voting privately or in public, including the option to reveal their vote if desired.

MACI 1.0 was released in 2021 and version 2 is coming out in 2024. They have revamped the documentation and are looking to integrate it into existing projects. Currently, the clr.fund is using MACI.</p>\n<p>MACI can stand alone as a voting system. New users must deposit their tokens when signing and will create a new key pair to vote. There will need to be some customization in order to integrate MACI into the Security council governor. One other complication is that MACI relies on a trusted coordinator to gather and report the vote tally. This coordinator can decrypt votes and can choose to never conclude a round.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Private, but votes can be read by the trusted coordinator.</td>\n<td>Needs a trusted coordinator</td>\n<td>The voter cannot reveal their vote</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The project is under active development and is a promising solution despite its complexity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-semaphore-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-semaphore-5\"></a>Semaphore</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://semaphore.pse.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore</a> offers anonymous group-based signaling and can be used as a foundation to build a private voting system. It has censorship resistance and is well documented with examples and guides on integrating it into existing smart contracts.</p>\n<p>It does require users to register an identity to be part of a voting group. The voting groups may need frequent updates to reflect token transfers, potentially increasing complexity and gas costs. While Semaphore provides voter anonymity, it doesn’t encrypt the votes themselves, requiring additional steps for complete vote secrecy.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>A deeper look into the identity registration process, group update mechanisms, and additional vote privacy measures will be necessary to adapt it to a comprehensive private voting solution.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-57854-cicada-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-cicada-6\"></a>Cicada</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/a16z/cicada\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Cicada</a> uses a time-lock puzzle scheme to delay revealing voter preferences until voting period has ended. It needs a membership proving system like Semaphore in order to protect voter identity and hence shares similar trade-offs.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Private until voting ends</td>\n<td>Public once voting ends</td>\n<td>Votes will be public once voting ends</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>It provides a novel method for implementing private voting but will most likely need some layer for voter anonymity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-plumenouns-aztec-private-voting-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-plumenouns-aztec-private-voting-7\"></a>Plume/Nouns Aztec Private Voting</h3>\n<p>We didn’t consider these ready because they are either explicitly a work in progress or they lacked enough documentation in relation to a private voting solution.

As the number of depositors increase the anonymity of the votes increase, and deposits should be represented in fixed numbers. An account that has multiple deposits will have to vote multiple times using multiple transactions. An account will also have to face the trade-off of privately voting and losing their liquidity</p>\n<h4><a name=\"p-57854-implementation-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-implementation-10\"></a>Implementation</h4>\n<p>In this construction, a user would deposit their ARB tokens along with a commitment hash of two secrets.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Depositors of the token pool, through a relayer, can cast their vote fractionally using Flexible Voting. A valid proof of a deposit, and a proposal id is required to prevent double voting. Using a zero knowledge proof, depositors can generate a merkle proof without revealing their secrets. Snapshots of merkle tree roots should be stored in order to prevent late depositors to vote for a proposal that has already started.</p>\n<p>To withdraw their deposits, the users will provide their secrets and will be able to withdraw back to the original depositor address that corresponds to the deposit commitment hash. Although all the technological pieces for this solution exist, and have been proven to work in other contexts, a  non-trivial amount of work would be required to put them together to construct production-ready privacy preserving voting. Nonetheless, this approach seems promising, as the work needed is primarily engineering work, rather than fundamental research…</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-stealth-voting-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-stealth-voting-11\"></a>Stealth voting</h3>\n<p>Another possible bespoke solution is a voting system that utilizes stealth addresses via ERC-5564 and ERC-6538. This implementation will require a trusted coordinator that is responsible for holding private keys corresponding stealth meta-addresses and tallying votes correctly.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Needs a trusted coordinator</td>\n<td>Can be optional with an additional governance extension contract</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h4><a name=\"p-57854-implementation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-implementation-12\"></a>Implementation</h4>\n<p>The basic idea is that a trusted coordinator will generate stealth meta-addresses corresponding to each option in a proposal. And anyone can announce their vote preference for a given proposal by including a stealth address generated using one of the stealth meta-addresses. Once the voting period ends, the trusted coordinator can tally the announcements each stealth meta-address owner has received, and output the winning option.</p>\n<p>This implementation would have the usual benefits that comes with stealth addresses. Voters can vote without an extra step and with their full voting weight, but their vote preference is linked to the stealth address’ hidden owner. There’s no liquidity concern as long as your voting weight can be queried from the token. The trusted coordinator portion could potentially be improved by incorporating a zero knowledge proof step to prove that tallying was done correctly. The governor will need to be upgraded to accept tallying results and an extension could be added to overwrite the behaviors of the default <code>castVote</code> function.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57854-railgun-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-railgun-13\"></a>Railgun</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.railgun.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Railgun</a> as it is now offers transaction anonymity, meaning the identity of the sender, recipient, token, and amount remain private once onboarded onto the system with new private key pairs. Critically, Railgun allows those who have deposited into the privacy pool to interact with external contracts by submitting zero knowledge proofs. Wallet software must be developed to construct the proofs for specific external calls and forward them to Railguns relayer network. The Railgun protcol charges a fee for each transaction sent in this manner.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Voter</th>\n<th>Ballot</th>\n<th>Tallying</th>\n<th>Optionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Customizing or creating a solution based on Railgun might prove challenging while introducing new reliance on the existing Railgun infrastructure. It still is a great privacy framework to keep in mind and Railgun SDK could help with this process. Bridging the gap between its current implementation and unique requirements of an onchain governance system will require significant research and effort.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-conclusion-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-conclusion-14\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our assessment of existing private voting solutions concludes that although there are several projects and tools that enable private voting, none of them are plug and play with Arbitrum DAO’s existing governance system. Any effort to add private voting would require additional effort to integrate a privacy solution with a new customized governor.</p>\n<p>We provided different trade-offs and it’s crucial to seek DAO members’ input on implementing an onchain private voting solution, their priorities and preferences, including voter anonymity, result verifiability, and potential trade-offs.</p>\n<p>We recommend the DAO to further explore the proposed new approaches when considering how to bring private voting to the security council election processes. In particular, the Shieled Pool solution seems the most promising in terms of a system that could be producitionized with a reasonable amount of effort, yet has minimal tradeoffs as it relates to privacy properties. Nonetheless, such an effort would require significant resource to be dedicated to developing proof of concepts, further research, audits and bug bounties.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-partial-delegation-solutions-assessments-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-partial-delegation-solutions-assessments-15\"></a>Partial Delegation Solutions Assessments</h2>\n<p>The current delegation structure limits token holders to delegating their voting power to a single address.

It works by having a user deposit the funds into a Franchiser contract that delegates them to the desired delegate. This system allows for the tokens to also be redelegated to another franchiser address.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Separate Vote flow</th>\n<th>Loss of liquidity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-57854-paritial-delegation-erc20votes-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-paritial-delegation-erc20votes-18\"></a>Paritial Delegation ERC20Votes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/voteagora/ERC20VotesPartialDelegationUpgradeable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">This solution</a> was developed by Agora with help from ScopeLift.

It enables token holders to delegate voting power to multiple addresses without losing liquidity and maintains the existing voting flow. Although, it requires a token upgrade and introduces higher gas costs for token transfers, these issues are not a deal breaker because Arbitrum’s token is upgradeable and the token existing on Arbitrum makes gas costs less of a concern. Additionally, the absence of sub-delegation support is not a critical limitation for the current needs of the DAO. Therefore, this solution aligns well with the DAO’s objectives for improved governance flexibility.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57854-references-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57854-references-20\"></a>References</h2>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/icon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"64\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore Demo</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a65b4bbcb6742b2b016fcc9d20faaba397072d77_2_690x362.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"13193A\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://demo.semaphore.pse.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Semaphore Demo</a></h3>\n\n  <p>A zero-knowledge protocol for anonymous signaling on Ethereum.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<p><a href=\"https://projects.ethberlin.org/submissions/334\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://projects.ethberlin.org/submissions/334</a></p><aside class=\"onebox githubrepo\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\" data-github-private-repo=\"false\">\n  <img width=\"690\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b7ab5d00b81bea8be24673a3e4d6e172df72c1d4_2_690x344.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEAEA\">\n\n  <h3><a href=\"https://github.com/plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - plume-sig/zk-nullifier-sig: Implementation of PLUME: nullifier friendly...</a></h3>\n\n    <p><span class=\"github-repo-description\">Implementation of PLUME: nullifier friendly signature scheme on ECDSA</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://research.aragon.org/img/main-logo.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">research.aragon.org</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/388;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/ac25e645cdcb672e291b803805ff01d91fde1202_2_690x388.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"B8A3ED\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Nouns Private Voting Research Sprint - General Report - Aragon ZK Research -...</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Nouns sprint report</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/edf96faf9653815ad054301e915997f2bf67ee6d.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"000000\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" title=\"12:00AM - 12 December 2023\">blog.rs – 12 Dec 23</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8605049b519148caab57e1f7c879f9589419ba47_2_500x500.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"4C4943\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://odyslam.com/blog/state-of-private-voting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The State of Private Voting in Ethereum</a></h3>\n\n  <p>The State of Private Voting in Ethereum and beyond.

As the leading scaling tech stack, we view Arbitrum as best primed to deliver on this vision and have therefore committed to work exclusively with the Arbitrum DAO. Our team is composed of crypto natives, with previous experience at Blockworks Research and 404 DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57846-delegate-statement-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57846-delegate-statement-2\"></a>Delegate Statement</h3>\n<p>Our primary objective for the Arbitrum DAO is to ensure that the Arbitrum tech stack becomes the most widely adopted infrastructure in the entire blockchain ecosystem. We envision a world where investors, users, and developers focus on contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem without even making the conscious decision to do so, primarily because the network effects have grown so exponentially that “Why Arbitrum?” is no longer a question being asked. We believe the Arbitrum tech speaks for itself in practice, and that with proper stewardship and contributions to the Arbitrum DAO, the aforementioned question will turn into “Why not Arbitrum?”.</p>\n<p>We are interested in contributing to all areas of the Arbitrum ecosystem as needs arise, but will be focusing on improving governance participation as well as tooling and protocol decentralization. The Arbitrum DAO is Entropy Advisors’ only customer, which is not something many other Arbitrum delegates can tout today. Our employees have extensive experience in research and have been active across numerous DAOs in the past, but have identified Arbitrum as the most promising technology stack and want to put all of our time, effort, and collective brainpower into ensuring the sustainable growth of the ecosystem – powered by the Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<p>Put simply, we believe in a diverse and highly capable delegate base, a DAO that is sustainable through diversified and robust revenue streams, responsible and carefully calculated spending that encourages the growth of the ecosystem, a highly intellectual group of service providers that can effectively execute on tasks on behalf of the DAO, and measures for accountability/processes that can stand the test of time.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57846-conflicts-of-interest-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57846-conflicts-of-interest-3\"></a>Conflicts of Interest</h3>\n<p>Entropy Advisors often authors or is directly involved in several proposals within Arbitrum DAO.

GovHack Core (v3) addresses this by laying the appropriate foundation.</li>\n<li>Need for deeper engagement and trust-building among core contributors</li>\n<li>Challenges in aligning on long-term vision, strategy and goals</li>\n<li>Difficulty in maturing and advancing high-impact proposals</li>\n<li>Desire for more focused, strategic discussions among key stakeholders</li>\n<li>Importance of in-person interactions for complex decision-making</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By providing a structured 3-day environment for intensive collaboration, GovHack Core will enhance decision-making processes, strengthen inter-team relationships, and ultimately drive the ecosystem’s growth and effectiveness.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57835-rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57835-rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>GovHack Core aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission and guiding values by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enhancing decentralized governance through focused collaboration among key decision-makers</li>\n<li>Maturing the DAO’s organisation by addressing unresolved conflicts and maturing high-impact proposals</li>\n<li>Improving transparency and accountability in strategic decision-making processes</li>\n<li>Strengthening core community bonds and deepening engagement of key contributors</li>\n<li>Increasing efficiency in governance by targeting resources towards critical strategic areas</li>\n<li>Balancing the need for focused discussions with appropriate levels of transparency to the wider Arbitrum community</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57835-key-terms-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57835-key-terms-5\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GovHack Core</strong>: A series of focused 3-day governance events designed for deep engagement and decision-making among existing Arbitrum ecosystem contributors.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic Alignment Sessions</strong>: Facilitated discussions aimed at solidifying the DAO’s Vision, Mission, Values, Strategy, and Goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Proposal Development Tracks</strong>: Collaborative cowork streams dedicated to maturing and advancing specific high-priority proposals.</li>\n<li><strong>Synthesis Groups</strong>: Collaborative sessions where insights and decisions from breakout groups are consolidated and refined.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57835-specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57835-specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>GovHack Core will consist of three annual events, each lasting exactly 3 days and involving max 60-80 key stakeholders.

I’m rxpwnz, currently serving as a community manager and technical moderator for the Hop Protocol, a role I’ve dedicated myself to for nearly three years. My responsibilities extend across several critical areas including operational security (OpSec), community support, troubleshooting, bug and vulnerability reporting, and more. Additionally, I have been a part of the Community Multisig committee at Hop Protocol for over a year, contributing to key governance decisions and securing community funds. I believe my unique blend of experience in these areas makes me an excellent candidate for the Security Council.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational Security (OpSec):</strong> In my current role, I prioritize the safety and security of our community members across all platforms, from Discord to our Forum, and beyond into broader web security. My proactive approach to OpSec has led to the elimination of over 150 phishing websites impersonating Hop Protocol, achieved by reporting these threats to MetaMask, various domain registrar providers, and Google.</p>\n<p>During a significant security incident involving our Discord server, where a moderator’s account was compromised, I acted swiftly to contain the breach. By disabling the compromised account’s access within minutes, I ensured that the impact on our community was minimal. This swift response was made possible by implementing a least privilege access model, which I advocate for and enforce rigorously.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Support &amp; Troubleshooting:</strong> Beyond security, I am deeply involved in providing community support and troubleshooting issues as they arise. This includes identifying and reporting bugs and vulnerabilities that could affect the user experience or the security of the platform. My hands-on approach ensures that our community remains engaged, informed, and secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Background in DevOps:</strong> In addition to my work in the crypto space, I bring a strong background as a DevOps engineer with a specialization in production incident resolution. My experience spans handling critical incidents during both regular business hours and 24/7 on-call shifts. I have led cross-team war rooms during critical incidents and have conducted thorough root cause analyses to prevent future occurrences.</p>\n<p><strong>Why I’m a Fit for the Security Council:</strong> My extensive experience in operational security within the Hop Protocol community, combined with my technical expertise in DevOps, positions me uniquely to contribute meaningfully to the Security Council. I am passionate about safeguarding our community and have a proven track record of taking proactive measures to mitigate risks and address threats swiftly.</p>\n<p>I look forward to the opportunity to bring my experience, dedication, and proactive mindset to the Security Council, ensuring the continued safety and resilience of our community.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631","pubDate":"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 16:34:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26631"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rxpwnz-candidate-for-security-council-elections-2024/26631.rss","#text":"Rxpwnz - Candidate for Security Council Elections 2024"},"filter":false},{"title":"Arbitrum Offsite format: online vs IRL","dc:creator":"danielo","category":"Proposals","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-57826-arbitrumdao-off-site-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-arbitrumdao-off-site-1\"></a>ArbitrumDAO Off-site</h1>\n<p>Non-Constitutional</p>\n<p>This proposal is a continuation of the directional proposal for an offsite which was voted in favour with 130mn ARB in Snapshot: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site-directional-proposal/25660\" class=\"inline-onebox\">ArbitrumDAO Off-site - Directional proposal</a></p>\n<p>IMPORTANT:<br>\nPlease vote based on the format selection.

Feel free to explain that any Tally approval vote would be conditional on XYZ. The vote I’m trying to focus it on the format selection.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-abstract-2\"></a>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This proposal aims to enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among token holders (including delegates) and key stakeholders by organizing a dedicated off-site event. The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured event will be organized in Q4, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.</p>\n<p>This proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to prioritise the most important agenda items to be discussed at the evente, ensuring the meeting time is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The event will then include professional facilitation to advance alignment, remove blockers, ensure proper note-taking, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.</p>\n<p>The success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem</h2>\n<p>The DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.</p>\n<p>Areas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to test a format for deliberation between key stakeholders with a clearly defined agenda. If successful, the format can be replicated to continuously address agenda items.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57826-proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution</h2>\n<p>Recent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for focused events to catalyse progress.

As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the meeting is effective. The facilitation includes designing the workshops and moderating the conversation, AND thinking through how to create a strategic process for a DAO.<br>\nCosts of Online facilitation might be lower than IRL. We’ll confirm this before the onchain proposal, for now costs are indicative to select a direction.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-agenda-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-agenda-11\"></a>Agenda</h3>\n<p>We’ve already started the process of setting the agenda. We ran a survey, answered by 29 delegates with 86mn+ ARB represented. And then ran SimScore (a collective intelligence algorithm) to cluster responses and identify the key topics. The results are presented below to encourage further discussion.</p>\n<p>Pre-selection of topics (to be refined and prioritised after the format is defined):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defining strategic priorities for the DAO (vision and strategy)</li>\n<li>DAO Budget (how much should the DAO be spending)</li>\n<li>Org Design</li>\n<li>ARB token utility</li>\n<li>Conflict Of Interest</li>\n<li>Grant programs (RPGF, what should be the focus, outcomes, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional work to be done to define the agenda:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 workshops and async discussion to identify root causes (root topics) and prioritise.</li>\n<li>The final agenda will be defined via a subsequent Snapshot vote facilitated by the project manager.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-hybrid-participation-for-irl-events-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-hybrid-participation-for-irl-events-12\"></a>Hybrid Participation for IRL events</h3>\n<p>We’ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost about $600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties. The online setup is of course less good than being IRL but it is still viable to contribute to sessions (anyone leading a session does need to be IRL but, for input in the discussion, online works).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57826-attendees-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57826-attendees-13\"></a>Attendees</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on high-context, expert, and senior participants.

Thrive rounds excel in generating consistent donations, with +50% more contributions at the 50th and 75th percentiles, indicating strong community engagement. Recommendation: Keep broad participation while exploring how to attract larger donations to further increase impact.</li>\n<li><strong>“Younger” Audience Engagement:</strong> Thrive-powered rounds attracted, on average, younger accounts to Gitcoin. Potentially indicating the onboarding of new users into the Gitcoin ecosystem. Recommendation: Continue to develop initiatives that generate new users, while also working towards the retention of these users as they mature in the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Participation Patterns in Gitcoin Rounds:</strong> Thrive-powered Gitcoin rounds show a “mid-participation period” spike in activity, unlike the general trend of being skewed toward the end of the round participation period. It would appear that Thrive-powered rounds are effective in engaging participants earlier in the process.</li>\n<li><strong>Jokerace’s Short-lived Success on Arbitrum:</strong> While Jokerace saw a peak in activity on Arbitrum during Thrive initiatives, this activity was not sustained and quickly shifted to other networks, mostly Base. This suggests that this activity was heavily dependent on activations, with limited sustained organic growth. Recommendation: Explore new ways of integrating Jokerace into the Arbitrum ecosystem to make its use more organic rather than Thrive-driven.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Reach of Thrive-Powered Jokerace Contests:</strong> Thrive-powered contests on Jokerace achieved significant social media reach, particularly on Twitter/X, almost hitting 100K users. However, this reach was concentrated in a few key participants. Recommendation: Explore new strategies to get more Key Opinion Leaders, or incentivize broader sharing to reduce the reliance on a few key players.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-current-limitations-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-current-limitations-2\"></a>Current Limitations</h3>\n<p>This analysis offers preliminary conclusions. Data analyzed for this report is limited to the end of Q2 2024 when the initiatives ended. Jokerace data has been decoded as much as possible and reflects an accurate approximation of reality, however only the listed chains have been taken into account.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-57592-gitcoin-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-gitcoin-3\"></a>Gitcoin</h2>\n<p>We focused our analysis on 3 main areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Impact of the Arbitrum-Gitcoin partnership in the context of the pluralistic grants framework.</li>\n<li>Characteristics of Gitcoin Rounds in Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>Characteristics of users engaging with Gitcoin Rounds in Arbitrum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-gitcoin-activity-by-network-arbitrum-is-king-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-gitcoin-activity-by-network-arbitrum-is-king-4\"></a>Gitcoin Activity by Network, Arbitrum is King</h3>\n<p>Gitcoin has been one of the preferred bounties platforms in the EVM ecosystem. Under the Pluralistic Grants Framework, Gitcoin was used as a channel to spur growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, facilitating contributions to open-source projects and generating exposure to a vast community of dedicated developers.</p>\n<p>If we take a look at the distribution of Gitcoin Rounds based on the network they were run on, we can see the dominance of Arbitrum as the network to run the rounds, 87% of the rounds in Q2 2024 were executed in Arbitrum. This aligns with campaigns executed by Thrive in Gitcoin.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b298f0d44810929c37858857171d0c029686a265.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ptWF9v9GVwPRibBSsptJEAIlMr3.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b298f0d44810929c37858857171d0c029686a265_2_620x347.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"ptWF9v9GVwPRibBSsptJEAIlMr3\" width=\"620\" height=\"347\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b298f0d44810929c37858857171d0c029686a265_2_620x347.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b298f0d44810929c37858857171d0c029686a265_2_930x520.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b298f0d44810929c37858857171d0c029686a265_2_1240x694.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"224D5F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Although all-time data shows a decrease in Gitcoin rounds since Q4 2021, likely aligned with the sentiment at the macro-level and the onset of the current bear market.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e61b34fd8e686cca501ef57ff11750e688a37691.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wPC6KGrUoPVqPREYeQ9U2niGf3H.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e61b34fd8e686cca501ef57ff11750e688a37691_2_624x349.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"wPC6KGrUoPVqPREYeQ9U2niGf3H\" width=\"624\" height=\"349\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e61b34fd8e686cca501ef57ff11750e688a37691_2_624x349.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e61b34fd8e686cca501ef57ff11750e688a37691_2_936x523.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e61b34fd8e686cca501ef57ff11750e688a37691_2_1248x698.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"26282F\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-gitcoin-rounds-on-arbitrum-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-gitcoin-rounds-on-arbitrum-5\"></a>Gitcoin Rounds on Arbitrum</h3>\n<p>Anlalyzing Gitcoin activity on Arbitrum reveals that USD $235,000 were donated during the period analyzed. Of this, only 22% is directly tied to Thrive initiatives, with the remaining 78% corresponding to non-Thrive related rounds.</p>\n<p>Focusing on Thrive related rounds, we observe smaller donation amounts, averaging $2.12 (with 75% of the donations below $1.16). In comparison, non-Thrive rounds had an average donation 63% higher, around $3.46 (with 75% of the donations below $2).</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rounds</th>\n<th>Thrive</th>\n<th>non-Thrive</th>\n<th>Delta</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Total Donations</td>\n<td>$52,911.00</td>\n<td>$182,743.00</td>\n<td>29%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avg.

However, looking at the 50th and 75th percentile - representing how many donations at least 50%/75% of the projects receive - we see that Thrive is outperforming the other gitcoin rounds significantly by over 50. This suggests that Thrive created very homogenous rounds with consistently high donation counts, aligning with Gitcoin’s foundational principles.</p>\n<p>In terms of participation, Thrive rounds showed a somewhat even distribution among the top 30 projects (between 400 and 500 donations). Total donation amounts display a different distribution, evidencing a noticeable gap between the top 3 projects and the runner-ups.</p>\n<p>It is worth to note that the Arbitrum DAO Delegates project received the highest donation count overall, totalling over 1.2k donations, and ranked 3rd in terms of total donation amounts</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/hosMFfzrsWCnqocfEEeLsOfEv5h.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"hosMFfzrsWCnqocfEEeLsOfEv5h\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_690x386.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/79e8e964b3eaadabd6eae659898205bb573c19b3_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"173539\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pIHM7DzR1QaeO2ywgfM11dsECZN.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"pIHM7DzR1QaeO2ywgfM11dsECZN\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_690x386.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/b/b44410fcd94d38d1494ccca1a021437e2bf0962f_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"172F33\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-57592-which-users-are-engaging-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-57592-which-users-are-engaging-6\"></a>Which Users Are Engaging?</h3>\n<p>If we take a look at the the users participating in the rounds executed during the analyzed time range, we can see that Thrive-related Rounds appeal to a “younger” audience, compared to non-Thrive rounds in Arbitrum. This suggests that Thrive Protocol efforts efforts are successfully onboarding new users into the Gitcoin ecosystem and contributing to community development.</p>\n<p>The average age of Gitcoin users participating in Thrive-related rounds is 574 days (approximately 1 year and 7 months), whereas for non-Thrive rounds, it’s around 1 year and 8 months (608 days). It’s worth noting that these averages are highly skewed and to get a better understanding we need to break the users by the time they join Gitcoin.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/295212ddf36e03b0ffe9f67e62e52c6875aa97a1.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/5TxpWfbyfSvPEAAQ2WMNPsR29Hj.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/295212ddf36e03b0ffe9f67e62e52c6875aa97a1_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"5TxpWfbyfSvPEAAQ2WMNPsR29Hj\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/295212ddf36e03b0ffe9f67e62e52c6875aa97a1_2_690x386.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/295212ddf36e03b0ffe9f67e62e52c6875aa97a1_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/295212ddf36e03b0ffe9f67e62e52c6875aa97a1_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"17262B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f84ccc31524b7a723a2f1faa179cae064040f6af.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zqyWWZk1UqucEhJAsHyw08PUU5F.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f84ccc31524b7a723a2f1faa179cae064040f6af_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"zqyWWZk1UqucEhJAsHyw08PUU5F\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f84ccc31524b7a723a2f1faa179cae064040f6af_2_690x386.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f84ccc31524b7a723a2f1faa179cae064040f6af_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f84ccc31524b7a723a2f1faa179cae064040f6af_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"212933\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>We also performed a time-based activity analysis to identify if there were any patterns in the way users interacted with the Gitcoin rounds and if there were any specific patterns that could be leveraged to maximize impact.</p>\n<p>The first thing that becomes evident is that activity is skewed towards the end of the participation period.

At a general level, the first thing that becomes evident is that Thrive-powered contests performed exceptionally well on Twitter/X, reaching over 98.9K users on this platform, making it the dominant channel for activation. This was likely aided by the fact that most projects were Twitter/X focused or leveraged this platform to engage with participants.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4c9d1a2ea5d77203ba6c8b7237c113a714fab9ec.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/aVKSqm96OG7lFKwJBNoetG1wuL2.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4c9d1a2ea5d77203ba6c8b7237c113a714fab9ec_2_690x386.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"aVKSqm96OG7lFKwJBNoetG1wuL2\" width=\"690\" height=\"386\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4c9d1a2ea5d77203ba6c8b7237c113a714fab9ec_2_690x386.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4c9d1a2ea5d77203ba6c8b7237c113a714fab9ec_2_1035x579.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/4c9d1a2ea5d77203ba6c8b7237c113a714fab9ec_2_1380x772.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"132328\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<p>In terms of the projects themselves, Thrive-powered contests manage to activate a handful of participants with decently sized Twitter/X accounts. Nevertheless, distribution is heavily skewed and concentrated in a reduced group of participants with very big reach and then falling off sharply.
