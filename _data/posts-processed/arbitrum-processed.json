But the answer will be as correct as possible only if we establish what growth looks like, and what we want to achieve in arbitrum in 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years. This is an open question for which there has never been a proper discussion; at the same time, i firmly believe we can’t just look for this answer and wait in the meantime due to the competitive landscape and how fast crypto is.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> work on short/mid/long term vision, in the meantime keep doing (at least some) incentives, and tailor when there is an answer.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Mostly unsolved: I personally don’t think we have ever analysed this properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> DAO wants to help good protocols.<br>\nThis can mean a lot of things. One interpretation is to either be more punitive with bad protocols, or rewards good ones, or both. But, beside malicious behaviours, it means tapping into previous question: when you know what you want arbitrum to be in 1/3/5/10 years, you can better understand which protocols are a driver. You also need proper way to measure protocols and data to literally read results.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> work on short/mid/long term vision + being able to monitor behaviour and analyse data to tailor incentive programs.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Same as previous problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> DAO wants to have easily digestible evaluation of programs and protocols.<br>\nThis translates in having an entity able to monitor data almost in real time, digest this data, present it in a way that is easy to understand. This also relies on the short/mid/long term vision you have, plus a normalisation of the data compared to the market (again: absolute numbers don’t mean anything).<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> work on short/mid/long term vision + data analysis entity/service provider at constant service of the DAO.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Partially done: we introduced data analysis entities (OBL, Blockworks), but we need a stronger mandate and a more robust method for the analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> DAO doesn’t want to throw money away.<br>\nThis is a generic statement, and to me still means understanding the cost of incentives vs the returns, either in metric or in assets. This could mean a few thing: understand KPI growth through alignment of programs with short/mid/long term vision + data analysis entity + constant monitoring of protocols, and potentially enable a fee sharing model with protocols, in which protocol share a portion of the excessive returns generated through the program. On top of this, a “sense check” on how much the DAO wants to spent per year.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> all of the previous + DAO budget with a bucket for incentives + profit sharing model between DAO and protocols.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Mostly unsolved: only now we are starting to talk about DAO budget, and we never look into profit sharing.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> DAO doesn’t want deliberate too much on single grants.<br>\nThis is about creating a mechanism in which there are important, informed decisions every 6 months / 1 year, in which the DAO relies on “experts” (service providers, elected people, others) and just comes when is time to evaluate data + a veto process on single entities.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> optimistic voting framework + an entity (council/advisors/others) constantly working with protocols.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Partially done: during STIP.b/LTIPP we used both the voting method and the council/advisors, but we definitely need to refine it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"protocols-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#protocols-2\"></a><strong>PROTOCOLS</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> protocols want to have more freedom in incentive usage.<br>\nThey need to be more agile in using grants, either cause competitive landscape changes or cause narrative changes or others. While the main north start so far has been using incentives for users, protocols also need to sometime rely on external service provider to properly operate. Mature protocols (—&gt; amount of participations in previous incentive programs for example) should have higher freedom in changing structure of incentives, tunnel up to a certain portion to third parties that are not users and others.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> a categorisation of protocols based on maturity levels, with promotions/retrocessions based on meaningful events (ie malicious behaviours + rubric aligned with short/mid/long term DAO goals) + data analysis. Potentially, different programs to which you can apply based on the criteria above.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Never discussed</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> protocols want to have less friction in applying/renewing.<br>\nThis is about having protocols not having to lose their time with infinite discussions, template and compiling data; or, at least, to have to do it once per year or when there are meaningful changes.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> incentive program with optimistic renewal (ie: 1 month duration, optimistic opt-in for 6 months as long as you have a virtuous behaviour backed by data).<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Never discussed</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> protocols want to have help to understand rules and establish mechanisms.<br>\nThis is about supporting programs constantly, not only during the draft of the proposals, in the lifecycle of the grant.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> supporting entity (council/advisors/others).<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Strangely at a decent point. Protocols were mostly happy about the new structure compared to stip 1 and backfund, but there is a lot of margin for improvement. And we definitely need way more people.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> protocols don’t want to have to negotiate every time to get in a program.<br>\nThis is about not having to do the same thing over and over (the goal of protocols is attracting users, not to fill the arbi forum) for the sake of doing it; even tho, partially, some compliance is and will always be required.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> optimistical opt-in, more streamlined KYC process and data process<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Only partially done with the optimistic vote, but a lot of margin for improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> protocols don’t want feel treated unevenly compared to peers and competitors.<br>\nThis is about have clear rules about who can participate to a program(s), why you might get rejected, and also knowing that even if you got rejected now there will be another possibility in a relative short term time (1 month?) to reapply + knowing what to do to reapply successfully.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> seasoned programs with very short cycles (1 month) and clear rules, plus support also after a rejection<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Never discussed, and we partially fumbled the bag during LTIPP on this, but we could solve it with better advisor/council/rubric structure.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"users-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#users-3\"></a><strong>USERS</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> users want to know what protocols have incentives and how to participates.<br>\nUsers want to have clear info on who will stream incentives, when they will start and end, what are the mechanisms. This doesn’t mean having to lurk in the obscure arbitrum forum and reading applications that are as long as an essay, but potentially have a central hub for info, updated, clear.<br>\n<strong>Possible solution:</strong> central website, constantly updated, with all the info, + marketing around these initiatives.<br>\n<strong>Where are we on this?</strong> Only partially done. We are moving to arbitrumgrants website, but we need a better structure.

Currently, delegates lack a clear picture of the DAO’s financial status, and proposers are unclear about how their proposals impact finances. To ensure long-term sustainability and informed decision-making, insight into the current state of DAO spending is essential. This proposal does not aim to define a budget for the DAO treasury but to lay the groundwork for it.</p>\n<p>The final deliverable is an aggregated dashboard reflecting the spending of Arbitrum DAO in 2024 available for all via a public website similar to <a href=\"https://expenses.makerdao.network/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this expenses dashboard created for MakerDAO</a>. If there is interest around continuing the initiative, we will submit an additional proposal to extend the scope to maintain the dashboard.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The DAO lacks a unified view into its expenditures. This means that delegates must make decisions without a clear picture into the DAO’s current financial status. On the other side, proposers also have a lack of clarity on how their proposals impact DAO finances.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the DAO is sustainable over the long term and to be able to continue to fund important initiatives, the DAO needs insight into the current state of DAO spending.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a view into current spending is a prerequisite for creating an eventual budget for DAO spending (please note that defining a budget for the DAO treasury is out of scope for this proposal).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-5\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>We believe that an aggregated dashboard of financial data would enhance transparency into DAO finances. It would complement existing initiatives like the monthly R3gen Finance “Token Flow Report,” which provide financial reporting on a monthly basis. These reports are highly informative, presenting an overview of key facts and figures, inflows and outflows, treasury holdings, DAO initiatives, and more. As a complement, the DAO would also benefit from a historical perspective on this data. However, the information is presented in a static format and is not dynamic.</p>\n<p>Such a dashboard would not only complement existing initiatives like the monthly r3gen Finance reports, but also be directly helpful by saving time and providing data for these reports. Additionally, it will offer a dynamic and customizable view of the state of finances for DAO members. The added flexibility of an actively maintained dashboard would also allow for more rapid iteration in response to evolving DAO needs and feedback, and to incorporate new findings from efforts by the ARDC and other groups within the DAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"powerhouse-decentralized-operations-platform-as-the-basis-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#powerhouse-decentralized-operations-platform-as-the-basis-7\"></a>Powerhouse Decentralized Operations Platform as the basis</h3>\n<p>We propose that <a href=\"https://www.powerhouse.inc/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Powerhouse</a> create the aggregated dashboard to track Arbitrum DAO spending.

This initiative aims to establish a distinct and recognizable symbol for Arbitrum, enhancing its visibility and appeal both within and outside the community.

This initiative aims to enhance brand recognition and community engagement by creating a strong, recognizable symbol representing Arbitrum’s identity and values.</p>\n<p>The mascot will be central to promoting Arbitrum’s brand, and the merchandise will serve as tangible representations of the community’s mission and values. This comprehensive project will be executed in multiple phases, including research, design, production, marketing, and distribution. By collaborating with web3 designers and community members, we aim to create a mascot that resonates with our audience and embodies the spirit of the Arbitrum blockchain.</p>\n<p>The merchandise will include high-quality items such as t-shirts, mugs, and plush toys, as well as innovative NFC-tagged products that generate collectible NFTs, integrating Arbitrum into both the physical and digital realms. Specifically, we plan to launch an online store similar to Big Shot and Nouns, where we will sell these mascot-themed products. The store will accept payments via Stripe and cryptocurrencies, making it accessible and convenient for the community.</p>\n<p>To kickstart this initiative, we will host a contest to design the mascot, offering a prize of 90k€. This will be followed by the production of 1000 high-quality stickers (15cm x 15cm), 200 plush toys (30cm high, 25€ each) with NFC tags and NFTs, and 200 high-quality t-shirts (10€ each). This holistic approach ensures that the mascot and its merchandise will not only enhance the brand’s visibility but also foster a sense of unity and pride within the Arbitrum community.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-9\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>Implementing this AIP will strengthen the Arbitrum community’s identity, foster a sense of belonging, and increase public awareness of the Arbitrum blockchain.

This will further enhance the mascot’s presence and engagement within the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Cheers</strong>! <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/artificial_satellite.png?v=12\" title=\":artificial_satellite:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":artificial_satellite:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/victorxva\">@Victorxva</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/juliomcruz\">@JulioMCruz</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-28-arbitrum-mascot-and-merchandise-development-initiative/25391\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-28-arbitrum-mascot-and-merchandise-development-initiative/25391","pubDate":"Sun, 07 Jul 2024 07:10:30 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25391"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-28-arbitrum-mascot-and-merchandise-development-initiative/25391.rss","#text":"Team 28: Arbitrum Mascot and Merchandise Development Initiative"},"filter":false},{"title":"Team #24 - Memebyosis: Arbitrum Memecoin Accelerator","dc:creator":"kingyam","category":"GovHack Brussels","description":"<p><strong>Track:</strong> Ventures</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Statement:</strong> The ARB token does not have traditional value accrual properties to incentivize holders</p>\n<p><strong>Members:</strong> Vlad Avesalon <span class=\"mention\">@vennityvlad</span> and Henri He <span class=\"mention\">@hhe17</span></p>\n<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> Henri He</p>\n<p><strong>Loom Video:</strong></p>\n<p><iframe class=\"loom-onebox\" src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/74228ecb68814f90ac5ec8ee10c6ac80?sid=de0052ed-0888-41d1-bb03-51cebb4c1245\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" seamless=\"seamless\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Abstract</p>\n<p>We propose to fund a meme coin accelerator as the catalyst to create a new utility for ARB token and to start the flying wheel of the ARB economic virtuous cycle. The accelerator will launch 5-10 new bespoke high-quality meme coin projects in 6 months. These fair-launch projects are required to use ARB as currency to purchase meme coins and to use ARB in AMM liquidity pools.</p>\n<p>Motivation</p>\n<p>Currently, the ARB token has no other utility besides the governance function in the Arbitrum DAO. Clearly, more utilities created for ARB token will add lots of value to the Arbitrum community, which are illustrated in the most recent proposals: <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-use-surplus-fees-to-align-governance/25084\">ARB Staking</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167\">Timeboost</a>.</p>\n<p>The invisible hand behind Solana’s huge success in meme coin is the economic engine where SOL is being used to purchase meme coins and being used/locked in the AMM LP pools - a new utility for SOL. It creates a virtuous cycle: meme coins generate new demands for SOL, which drives up the SOL price, which creates value to SOL holders who then deploy the profit back to meme coins.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum now has the infrastructure ready to replicate the SOL playbook, and by doing so, it will create a new utility for the ARB token, increase Aribitrum’s TVL, and supply new assets for Arbitrum’s DeFi. And to execute the vision, we need a catalyst. A meme coin accelerator is the catalyst to showcase the new utility of ARB and to start the flying wheel of the ARB economic virtuous cycle.</p>\n<p>Rationale</p>\n<p>This proposal contributes to Arbitrum Community Value by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure. In addition, supporting meme coins makes Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive.</p>\n<p>Specifications</p>\n<p>Meme coin projects are required to use ARB to purchase meme coins, especially any pre-sale, and use/lock ARB in the AMM LP pools.</p>\n<p>Meme coin creators will only need to focus on community, social &amp; marketing, and the accelerator will do the common work for these projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product &amp; engineering work on both smart contracts and front-end (done by Double)</li>\n<li>Liquidity support via Double and incentive distribution to capital providers (done by Double)</li>\n<li>BD with Arbitrum ecosystem projects especially DeFi projects (done by accelerator managers)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steps to Implement</p>\n<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves the proposal, then</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Searching and recruiting meme coin creators on a rolling basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design and develop the smart contracts and front-end products, and customize them for each project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch meme coins on a rolling basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Incentivize liquidity providing for each meme coin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conduct BD with Arbitrum ecosystem projects especially DeFi projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Timeline</p>\n<p>After getting on-chain approval and funding, complete the program in 6 months.</p>\n<p>Overall Cost</p>\n<p>The proposal requests total funding of $610k in ARB from Arbitrum DAO, which will be used to fund:</p>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1:</span> $270k on product &amp; engineering. 3 FTE@$15k/month for 6 months - 1 FTE on smart contract, 1 FTE on front-end, 1⁄2 FTE on designer, 1⁄2 FTE on product management.</p>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2:</span> $250k to incentivize liquidity providing for meme coins.</p>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3:</span> $90k for accelerator program management: 3 managers@$5k/month for 6 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Deck link:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://tome.app/vennity/memechain-copy-clyac13ot0vwqbvf1liaz1h6q\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://tome.app/vennity/memechain-copy-clyac13ot0vwqbvf1liaz1h6q</a></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-24-memebyosis-arbitrum-memecoin-accelerator/25390\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-24-memebyosis-arbitrum-memecoin-accelerator/25390","pubDate":"Sun, 07 Jul 2024 07:05:38 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25390"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-24-memebyosis-arbitrum-memecoin-accelerator/25390.rss","#text":"Team #24 - Memebyosis: Arbitrum Memecoin Accelerator"},"filter":false},{"title":"TEAM 20 - Local Hubs Working Group","dc:creator":"ostanescu.eth","category":"GovHack Brussels","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/188fcaea6eb67ce12c2623173c37004777c66a8f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3vhx59V2h57C7xYpoP9qOpUPEM7.png?dl=1\" title=\"TEAM 20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/188fcaea6eb67ce12c2623173c37004777c66a8f_2_690x388.png\" alt=\"TEAM 20\" data-base62-sha1=\"3vhx59V2h57C7xYpoP9qOpUPEM7\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/188fcaea6eb67ce12c2623173c37004777c66a8f_2_690x388.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/188fcaea6eb67ce12c2623173c37004777c66a8f_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/188fcaea6eb67ce12c2623173c37004777c66a8f_2_1380x776.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"575E6B\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Track Number:</strong> GovHack</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Track Name:</strong> Community / IRL Activation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Challenge Statement:</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The current lack of an easy onboarding system makes it challenging to incubate communities from various geographical localisations on Arbitrum, leading to fragmented outcomes across the ecosystem.

This proposal aims to further diversify the Arbitrum DAO treasury by including medium and high-risk profile assets, thereby reducing its dependence on the crypto-native asset, ARB.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>As of July 6th, we have observed that the Arbitrum DAO treasury consists of a total of 3,164,180,268 ARB and 13,943 ETH. This means that the Arbitrum DAO treasury is 97.9% dependent on ARB, a crypto-native asset. To prevent the DAO treasury from being affected by the inherent volatility of crypto-native assets, it is necessary to diversify the treasury. During this diversification, choosing products that provide real-world yields is ideal for reducing the treasury’s exposure to the price dynamics of the crypto market. Therefore, we should diversify the Arbitrum treasury through RWAs</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/ca6c56fa210aadca4878dc8f431375d78ee0df8a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sSIz5fSITqsTbOdEdeWLJP57b7Q.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/ca6c56fa210aadca4878dc8f431375d78ee0df8a_2_657x406.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"sSIz5fSITqsTbOdEdeWLJP57b7Q\" width=\"657\" height=\"406\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/ca6c56fa210aadca4878dc8f431375d78ee0df8a_2_657x406.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/ca6c56fa210aadca4878dc8f431375d78ee0df8a.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/ca6c56fa210aadca4878dc8f431375d78ee0df8a.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B4CDF8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source: Arbiscan | <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf3fc178157fb3c87548baa86f9d24ba38e649b58\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARB Wallet</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0xbfc1feca8b09a5c5d3effe7429ebe24b9c09ef58\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ETH Wallet<br>\n</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UV8ZjlWmRXGJr4XMrU3E3sUoa0MrdvKl67w7inHcf7M/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">In a report prepared by karpatkey</a> in January 2024, the value of the Arbitrum DAO treasury was stated to be $6,464,800,485.

The most prominent among these projects are <a href=\"https://app.citadao.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CitaDAO</a> and <a href=\"https://alta.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Alta</a>. In this proposal, the decision on which intermediary project to work with and the associated risks will be determined based on the research report to be prepared in the near future.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"carbon-credits-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#carbon-credits-10\"></a>Carbon Credits</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.toucan.earth/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Toucan</a> tokenizes CO2 Removal Certificates bidirectionally through various bridges. This provides investment opportunities aligned with the emerging Carbon Zero mission. Given that it is a still-maturing sector with new applications, the risk profile is quite high. Toucan has tokenized 21,890,661 carbon credits to date.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"steps-to-implement-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-11\"></a>Steps to Implement</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>To implement the project, risk analyses of the previously mentioned RWA yield strategies must be conducted. Detailed reports should be created on the risks and returns of RWA yield options categorized into three different levels: low, medium, and high risk. A public grant ($25K in ARB) should be established for this purpose, and the most competent research companies and organizations applying for the grant should be selected through on-chain voting.</li>\n<li>At the end of June, voting is underway on a recommendation by the STEP Committee to allocate $35M to low-risk assets, which are primarily composed of U.S. Treasury Bills, U.S. Government Securities, and the U.S. Dollar. This vote is currently receiving overwhelming support.</li>\n<li>If this vote is approved, $35M will be allocated to low-risk RWA products. This proposal aims to diversify the treasury by also allocating funds to medium- and high-risk RWA assets.</li>\n<li>Assuming $35M is allocated to low-risk assets, it is planned to enter a trial phase by allocating $15M to medium-risk assets and $5M to high-risk assets. If the targeted yields are successfully achieved with the allocated assets, another vote will be conducted to increase these amounts.</li>\n<li>The STEP Committee is expected to ensure the necessary organization of the program by working with relevant individuals in Legal Compliance and Partnerships. Partnerships need to be established with the providers of RWA assets identified through research. Additionally, throughout these processes, the Arbitrum Foundation and the STEP Committee should work closely together to determine whether the Arbitrum DAO can be recognized as a legal entity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"timeline-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-12\"></a>Timeline</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 1 (Research)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Share the grant program publicly on the Arbitrum Forum. Allow 2 weeks for researchers to apply to the program. Allocate 1 week for the STEP Committee to assess the qualifications of the applicants. Conduct a 1-week voting period for those who pass the qualification check. Considering potential delays, a total time frame of 5-6 weeks is required.</p>\n<p>Allow 4 weeks for the winning team to complete the research. In total, 9-10 weeks are needed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 2 (Legal Compliance)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>During these collaborations, depending on whether Arbitrum DAO has a legal entity or not, the Arbitrum Foundation may need to enter into some agreements.</p>\n<p>The STEP Committee will be responsible for examining the legal obligations necessary for this proposal. Since this committee is already managing the grant related to low-risk assets, they will also handle this task.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 3 (Business Development and Partnership)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When investing in RWA assets with Medium and High-Risk Profiles, the size of permissionless pools can be small and thus fully occupied. The Arbitrum DAO should form partnerships with intermediary projects for investing in RWA assets, enabling investments to be made directly through these partnerships.</p>\n<p>Partnership negotiations will be conducted by the STEP Committee on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO and are expected to take approximately 2-3 weeks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 4 (Medium Risk Profile Integration)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using the obtained research report, collaborate with projects that have a medium-risk profile and transfer the targeted $15M to RWA assets, sending them to the treasury’s wallet address.</p>\n<p>A time frame of 2-3 weeks is required for collaboration with two different organizations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 5 (High Risk Profile Integration)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there are no issues encountered during the diversification of the treasury with medium-risk assets, the planned $5M should also be transferred to high-risk assets. Additionally, the acquired RWA assets should be sent to the treasury’s wallet address.</p>\n<p>Similar to Milestone 4, a time frame of 2-3 weeks is required.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"overall-cost-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overall-cost-13\"></a>Overall Cost</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Research\n<ul>\n<li>$25K equivalent in ARB</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Medium Risk Profile RWA Assets Diversification\n<ul>\n<li>$15M equivalent in ARB</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>High Risk Profile RWA Assets Diversification\n<ul>\n<li>$5M equivalent in ARB</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>STEP Committee\n<ul>\n<li>$5K equivalent in ARB per member ($25K total)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Total Cost</strong>: $20.05M equivalent in ARB</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-17-arbitrum-dao-treasury-diversifying-through-rwa-assets/25384\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-17-arbitrum-dao-treasury-diversifying-through-rwa-assets/25384","pubDate":"Sun, 07 Jul 2024 06:41:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25384"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-17-arbitrum-dao-treasury-diversifying-through-rwa-assets/25384.rss","#text":"Team 17 - Arbitrum DAO Treasury Diversifying Through RWA Assets"},"filter":false},{"title":"Team 27 ArbitrumAgent: Empowering Decentralized Governance and Development with AI","dc:creator":"rblockchaindeveloper","category":"GovHack Brussels","description":"<h2><a name=\"title-arbitrumagent-empowering-decentralized-governance-and-development-with-ai-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#title-arbitrumagent-empowering-decentralized-governance-and-development-with-ai-1\"></a>Title: ArbitrumAgent: Empowering Decentralized Governance and Development with AI</h2>\n<h4><a name=\"track-ai-gov-tech-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#track-ai-gov-tech-2\"></a>Track: AI, Gov, Tech</h4>\n<h4><a name=\"group-27-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#group-27-3\"></a>Group: 27</h4>\n<h3><a name=\"challenges-in-the-current-grant-approval-process-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#challenges-in-the-current-grant-approval-process-4\"></a>Challenges in the Current Grant Approval Process</h3>\n<p>Inconsistent Approvals: The unpredictable nature of grant approvals creates uncertainty and hampers community progress.</p>\n<p>Resource Drain: Manual approval processes consume significant team resources and energy, leading to reduced productivity.</p>\n<p>Missed Opportunities: The current system’s inefficiencies result in missed opportunities for valuable contributions to the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Loom Video: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/ed2cadf019af4916a39984aea8b9e818?sid=d75c7750-44b2-4677-a411-9171c55a01f0\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Empowering Decentralized Governance with AI in DAOs | Loom</a></p>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong><br>\nDevelop an intelligent agent, ArbitrumAgent, that automates the approval of micro-grants, provides specialized AI-driven assistance within the Arbitrum ecosystem, and enhances developer support and community engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br>\nArbitrumAgent is designed to revolutionize the way the Arbitrum ecosystem operates by leveraging AI and automation.

The goal is to provide a clear, structured path for individuals to get involved, contribute, and enhance the ecosystem, while reducing the workload on current delegates.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-7\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The lack of a clear onboarding process for new contributors, delegates, and grantees is a significant barrier to their participation in the Arbitrum DAO. Establishing a structured framework will guide individuals to effectively engage with the community, driving innovation and growth within the ecosystem. The framework targets three main contributor types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contributors:</strong> Focus on creating proposals to enhance the Arbitrum DAO, improving their ability to make impactful contributions.</li>\n<li><strong>Grantees:</strong> Facilitate understanding of available grants and help identify suitable options for funding projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance Analysts:</strong> Mentor individuals interested in DAO governance, fostering a skilled talent pool for delegate roles and protocol workflows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Optimizing DAO resources and operational efficiency, his framework minimizes delegates time spent in answering questions from new members, enhances proposal quality, and cultivates a talent funnel that encourages active participation and growth within governance teams.</p>\n<p>These insights stem from active participation in the Arbitrum Onboarding Working Group, which includes representation from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ocandocrypto\">@ocandocrypto</a> collaborating with <strong>Seed LATAM, L2 Beat, 404 DAO, and Web3 Citizen as a second step proposal for the first experimental one.</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-8\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Establishing a structured onboarding framework is crucial for the Arbitrum DAO as it simplifies entry for new participants, easing the path to contribution for grantees, contributors, and governance analysts alike. This approach reduces barriers, enhances community engagement, and fosters a sense of shared purpose. By investing in this framework, we bolster the Arbitrum ecosystem’s inclusivity, innovation, and ability to attract and retain top talent in the web3 space.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"goals-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#goals-9\"></a>Goals</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Streamline Onboarding for Contributors, Delegates, and Grantees</strong>: Develop a comprehensive onboarding framework that clearly outlines the steps for individuals to get involved in the Arbitrum DAO, whether they are looking to contribute to projects, seek grants, or participate in governance.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhance Community Engagement and Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Create sessions focused on onboard each type of contributor, having sessions with experienced DAO members, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.</li>\n<li><strong>Facilitate Access to Resources and Support:</strong> Create a centralized Resource Guide that offers comprehensive information, tutorials, and FAQs. This guide will be easily accessible to all newcomers upon their first visit to the forum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-10\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"arbitrum-dao-onboarding-framework-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#arbitrum-dao-onboarding-framework-11\"></a>Arbitrum DAO Onboarding Framework</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Weekly Onboarding Calls:</strong> The Onboarding Working Group will continue hosting a weekly Arbitrum DAO Onboarding Call, where attendees will share their background and motivations to become part of the Arbitrum DAO. The Onboarding Working Group will share the different options to get involved in the DAO (as contributor, grantee and/or governance) and share that there will be a monthly call focused on each group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reach out to new members to invite them to Focused Monthly Calls:</strong> The Onboarding Framework team will reach out to the new members to remind them to attend the Focused Monthly Call that they could be more interested about.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Focused Monthly Calls:</strong> These calls will share everything each type of contributor should know for the next steps in their Arbitrum DAO contribution path. Each call will have different content and Q&amp;A time:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Grantees</strong>: The session will be “Grants 101” where attendees get to know the current grants they could apply for like Arbitrum Grants (Questbook, Foundation, Thrive, DAO), Arbitrum Funding Programs (GCP, etc.), also they will get an Arbitrum Grants Leader Directory and Application Templates.</li>\n<li><strong>Contributors and Governance Analysts:</strong> They will have a session called “DAO 101” to explain the current initiatives in the DAO, main leaders, DAO resources and Calendar, how to use the forum and how to write a proposal. This session serves as a filter, participants interested in creating proposals will go to the Fellowships Incubators and the ones interested in becoming part of Arbitrum Governance will go to the Governance Analyst Incubator.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incubators for Contributors and Governance Analysts:</strong> 1 month of duration incubators that will accelerate the onboarding of Contributors and Governance Analysts from 0 to bring value to the Arbitrum DAO. Each one will be focused in a different result:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Contributors:</strong> They will have a “Fellowship Incubator”, people with similar background will be put together in a group focused on DevRel, Operations, Social Media or Business Development, they will have weekly mentorship on how to write a proposal and the expected deliverable is the submission of a proposal to the Governance Forum.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance Analysts:</strong> For contributors interested in governance, they will have a “Governance Analyst Incubator” where they will learn how to become delegates, learn the daily governance workflow, how to analyze a proposal and vote for it. They will receive weekly mentorship from experienced delegates on how the Arbitrum DAO governance works, the expected deliverable from this Incubator is to analyze proposals and post feedback weekly.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Follow up Incubators results:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fellowship Incubator:</strong> Measure how many proposals were submitted and the feedback

href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposal-3\"></a>Proposal</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"abstract-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-4\"></a>Abstract</h3>\n<p>We want to increase the transparency into the Orbit stack by aggregating important metrics on a chain level so that users, builders, and DAO members can make better data-driven decisions, including what revenue an Orbit chain generates. This means creating a dedicated Arbitrum Orbit Stack page on growthepie.xyz having 20 chains listed with standardized metrics for each chain and an aggregated fundamental metrics view for the whole stack.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-5\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>So far, there is no go-to place that provides an overview of Arbitrum Orbit. Standardized metrics allow a better idea of the performance and outlook of each chain being part of the Arbitrum Orbit. This results in greater transparency for all chains regarding their activity and how the usage of one chain compares to another.</p>\n<p>Users can use this information to gather a quick overview of the Orbit ecosystem. Builders can use the different metrics to better track adoption, and DAO members can make more data-driven decisions on future initiatives (e.g., Orbit retrospective funding based on on-chain contribution to the DAO).</p>\n<p>Also, visibility for the overall Arbitrum Orbit stack is increased, and the whole Ethereum ecosystem can see what is going on in the Arbitrum ecosystem - where to be and interact, build, or allocate funding towards. Additionally, for DAO members and delegates, revenue metrics provide future insight into how the Orbit approach should be developed to make it profitable for the DAO as well (more transparency around revenue and costs).</p>\n<p>This proposal is meant as a start for a long-term partnership to provide listing of Orbit chains long-term and on a recurring basis on growthepie. After the listing of the first setup and 20 initial chains, we would like to follow up with another AIP to enable listing of the 21st+ chain.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-6\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>growthepie is an entirely public goods funded analytics platform for Ethereum scaling solutions. The AIP aligns closely with the Arbitrum community’s mission and guiding values. At growthepie, Ethereum alignment is at the core of our existence, ensuring that our efforts contribute to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We aim to enhance transparency, enabling data-driven decisions that are crucial for tracking outcomes and improving strategic decisions. All our code is open-source, allowing anyone to review and verify our metric logic. This openness fosters trust and ensures the integrity of our platform. We prioritize inclusivity by offering our platform and API completely free of charge, ensuring maximum accessibility for all users.</p>\n<p>Our user-focused design philosophy centers on the needs of our diverse audience, making data easy to digest and actionable for all users. We uphold the values of neutrality and openness as we believe in the power of data to increase transparency and objectivity. All information on our platform is freely available, reinforcing our commitment to these principles.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"key-terms-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-7\"></a>Key Terms</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Gas fees paid by chain users</li>\n<li><strong>Onchain contributions to DAO:</strong> Orbit chain revenue contribution to the DAO (exact mechanics and details TBD)</li>\n<li><strong>Fundamentals metrics:</strong> Transaction Count, Active Addresses, Throughput, Stablecoin Market Cap, TVL, Revenue (Fees paid by users), Costs (Settlement/DA), Profit (Revenue – costs), FDV, Market Cap, Transaction Costs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"specifications-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-8\"></a>Specifications</h3>\n<p>growthepie has proven to be a platform for people wanting to understand the overall health, activity, and usage across the Ethereum scaling solutions ecosystem. Arbitrum One was listed as one of the first 5 chains from the beginning. Since then, Arbitrum members have used the platform to compare Arbitrum One with other Layer 2s, and we have provided reliable data and visualizations for Arbitrum’s community. Marketing has also used our charts to provide data-driven insights into the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Building on this, the Arbitrum Orbit should be given a dedicated place on growthepie with 20 chains listed in the beginning. This allows us to provide a mostly complete overview of the whole Arbitrum stack. This proposal is aimed at the start of a longer partnership. Hence, as part of this proposal, we will design and set up the initial pages and backend needed to onboard Orbit chains, aggregate fundamental metrics, and especially revenue metrics for each chain.</p>\n<p>Each Orbit chain – as Arbitrum One and any other chain listed on growthepie – will have their own set of metrics (activity, value locked, economics, and convenience) and their own single chain page. Additionally, each chain will appear on each fundamental metrics page for which the specific metric is available.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we will introduce a Stack view (new page) that provides a complete overview of the whole stack aggregated. This will be on a dedicated page which will enable users, builders, and DAO members solely interested in the Orbit to go to this place and learn more. See the prototype which includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leading chart that aggregates Layers 2 and/or Layer 3s together showing growth over time</li>\n<li>Table that lists all available Orbit chains on growthepie separated into Layer 2 and Layer 3</li>\n<li>Fundamental metrics section with the aggregated view of all chains combined in the Arbitrum Orbit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This set of views will make it possible to easily get an overview and see the growth of the whole Orbit ecosystem but also to compare certain Orbit chains against each other (or against other Layer 2s from other ecosystems).</p>\n<h3><a name=\"steps-to-implement-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-9\"></a>Steps to Implement</h3>\n<p>Timeframe starting from the date of DAO proposal approval and weeks/months add up to each other. Total duration ~ 5 months. Chain listing time is also dependent on potential collaboration with an indexing provider and their speed of chain indexing.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"steps-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-10\"></a>Steps</h4>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Step</th>\n<th>Resources (hrs)</th>\n<th>Costs (in ARB)</th>\n<th>Timeframes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Design and implement general platform UX adjustments on growthepie.xyz (more chains mean restructuring of UI elements and different filter logic)</td>\n<td>Design - 20, Frontend - 40</td>\n<td>13800 ARB</td>\n<td>3 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Design and implementing frontend views: Orbit specific stack view, Single chain view (for each Orbit chain), Fundamentals view (to compare Orbit chains)</td>\n<td>Design – 15, Frontend – 50</td>\n<td>14950 ARB</td>\n<td>3 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Streamline listing process</td>\n<td>Frontend – 10, Backend - 15</td>\n<td>5750 ARB</td>\n<td>2 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data infra setup (RPCs, database execution) and Frontend hosting costs</td>\n<td>Backend – 30</td>\n<td>6900 ARB</td>\n<td>2 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metric aggregation &amp; Logic: Activity (Transaction Count, Active Addresses – daily and monthly), Value locked (Stablecoin Market Cap, Total Value Locked), Economics (Revenue, Costs, Onchain Profit), plus Market Cap and Fully Diluted Valuation where applicable, Convenience metrics: Transaction Costs (median 1-day aggregation), DAO Contributions (how much back to ARB)</td>\n<td>Research - 20, Backend - 40</td>\n<td>13800 ARB</td>\n<td>2 weeks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Listing first 10 Orbit chains and maintaining frontend + data pipeline for 1 year</td>\n<td>Design – 10, Research – 40, Backend – 80, Frontend – 20, Infra - fixed</td>\n<td>125000 ARB</td>\n<td>1.5 months</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Listing 10 more Orbit chains and maintaining frontend + data pipeline for 1 year (20 total)</td>\n<td>Design – 10, Research – 40, Backend – 80, Frontend – 20, Infra - fixed</td>\n<td>125000 ARB</td>\n<td>1.5 months</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"overall-cost-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overall-cost-11\"></a>Overall Cost</h3>\n<p><strong>Fix setup costs ($ARB 55.2k):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design and implement general platform UX adjustments (more chains mean restructuring of UI elements and different filter logic)</li>\n<li>Designing and implementing frontend views: Orbit specific stack view, Single chain view (for each Orbit chain), Fundamentals view</li>\n<li>Data infra setup (RPCs, database execution)</li>\n<li>Metric aggregation &amp; Logic: Activity (Transaction Count, Active Addresses – daily and monthly), Value locked (Stablecoin Market Cap, Total Value Locked), Economics (Revenue, Costs, Onchain Profit), plus Market Cap and Fully Diluted Valuation where applicable, Convenience metrics: Transaction Costs (median 1-day aggregation), DAO Contributions (how much back to ARB)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Initial chain listings (20 Orbit chains in total) and maintenance for 1 year ($ARB 250k):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate brand assets (icon, colors, etc.) for each chain</li>\n<li>Pull raw transaction data and store in our database</li>\n<li>Setup metric logic where applicable (e.g., bridge contracts for value locked, custom gas tokens, DA layer, settlement layer)</li>\n<li>Daily aggregation of all relevant datapoints</li>\n<li>Data available via API (for frontend and other data consumers)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirement:</strong> Arbitrum Foundation provides indexed data.

Abstract</h2>\n<p>DevRel Uni is seeking $30K in funding to develop and deliver a program aimed at training Developer Relations (DevRel) talent for the Arbitrum ecosystem. This initiative seeks to create Web3 DevRel talent to ensure that every protocol built on Arbitrum can receive adequate DevRel support. The program aims to bolster the Arbitrum ecosystem by providing Web3 DevRel talent, facilitating content creation, documentation support, and enabling dApp prototyping.</p>\n<p>Building on the success of five previous cohorts, which included over 30 training sessions, training 250+ students from more than 50 countries, and achieving a 56% job placement rate in DevRel roles, the program is designed to upskill new DevRel professionals, attracting new talent to create valuable educational resources for the Arbitrum community. Participants will benefit from lectures from Web3 DevRels experts, hands-on tutorials, assignments, and a supportive community environment.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-motivation-2\"></a>2. Motivation</h2>\n<p>While Arbitrum boasts great technology and a rich ecosystem of protocols, it currently lacks DevRel support, which negatively impacts the attraction and retention of new developers. Arbitrum has a significant advantage over other protocols due to products like Stylus, which have the potential to tap into the vast pool of Web2 developers (as of 2023, there are around <a href=\"https://www.developerreport.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">22K Web3 developers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.evansdata.com/press/viewRelease.php?pressID=339\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">26.3M Web2 developers</a>). However, without adequate support to nurture these Web2 developers, Arbitrum may miss crucial opportunities. Educational resources and developer support are essential for onboarding new developers, and these are offered by DevRel professionals.</p>\n<p>One key reason for the lack of DevRel support is the shortage of Web3 DevRel talent. Although many courses, bootcamps, and initiatives cater to aspiring developers, there is a noticeable lack of resources for those interested in transitioning into DevRel roles, which are crucial for scaling any developer ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Building on the success of its previous five cohorts, DevRel Uni aims to partner with Arbitrum for the long term. Initially, this will involve this initial DevRel Cohort, with potential expansion to in-person (IRL) events and further DevRel talent enablement and initiatives, such as collaboration with Arbitrum’s DevRel Fellowship.

Developer Relations (DevRel) is crucial for attracting and retaining these builders by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Educating developers</li>\n<li>Building relationships</li>\n<li>Representing the protocol</li>\n<li>Making the technology accessible to newcomers</li>\n<li>Retaining developers and keeping them engaged within the ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, to achieve this, DevRel talent must be trained and guided towards the Arbitrum ecosystem. With DevRel Uni Cohort 6, we aim to <strong>cultivate a pool of DevRel talent that will expand DevRel efforts within the Arbitrum ecosystem</strong>, in alignment with Arbitrum’s mission to be the home for builders.</p>\n<p>The need for DevRel talent and support has been validated as well though interviews with different protocols from the Arbitrum ecosystem during GovHack, such as the GMX team.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-4-key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-4-key-terms-4\"></a>4. Key Terms</h2>\n<p><strong>Developer Relations (DevRel)</strong> can be defined as the practice of <strong>fostering a vibrant ecosystem of third-party developers</strong> by serving as the interface between these developers and the platform’s product, engineering, and marketing teams.</p>\n<p>DevRel professionals advocate for developers’ needs, create educational resources, offer technical support, and build a sense of community. They also gather feedback to help improve the product, ensuring developers have the tools and knowledge needed to succeed. Through these efforts, DevRel enhances developer experience, drives adoption, and promotes innovation within the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-5-specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-5-specifications-5\"></a>5 Specifications</h2>\n<p>DevRel Uni Cohort is a <strong>six week cohort-based program</strong> where students get to learn from the best Web3 DevRel professionals while tackling DevRel challenges.</p>\n<p>The program will comprise 6 lectures delivered by different mentors, followed by 6 workshops that allow students to put in practice the notions just learned, and homework assignments</p>\n<p>There will be a post-event media production with students’ testimonials and storytelling to amplify the event on social platforms, as well as written testimonials.</p>\n<p>Post event, an impact report will be created with our key learnings and impact. It will be shared with the Arbitrum community, as well as on DevRel Uni’s <a href=\"https://medium.com/@devreluni\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Medium</a>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-6-steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-6-steps-to-implement-6\"></a>6.

(And as you will read below it’s quite difficult).</p>\n<p>A Decentralized sequencers mechanism is crucial to prevent downtime, bad beheavoring and ensure the integrity of any chain. This proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s vision of progressive decentralization and aims to refine the standard for the incoming decentralized sequencers.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Decentralizing sequencers ensures that no single entity has the ability to misuse their power, aligning with the principle of “Can’t be bad &gt; Don’t be bad”.</p>\n<p>Once in the GovHack event in Brussels, we considered deploying an OrbitChain using a decentralized sequencer. Setting a precedent for a new way to address this issue explained above.</p>\n<p>The goal was to create a track record that can be implemented later on Arbitrum Chain or, at the very least, establish a new method that hopefully becomes a standard for others to utilize from now on.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, there are two main possibilities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using the current stack (Testnet) developed by Off Chain Labs + Espresso.</li>\n<li>Developing a new mechanism where several nodes/sequencers designated by a council to validate transactions, and following a standard consensus mechanism.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both mechanisms function similarly to a decentralized L1 and If both perform well, they will avoid MEV, sequencer downtime, and other issues.</p>\n<p>However, the challenges are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Espresso solution is not yet live on the mainnet and is still in the testing process.</li>\n<li>Implementing the second option is technically difficult, broad in scope, and requires continuous collaboration with the Off Chain Labs team. Which is already exploring this idea.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on the feedback from Off-Chain Labs, the ARB Foundation, and people from the Espresso team , we have decided to change the proposal. We realized that assigning a squad of experts would add more value to the ecosystem than simply launching a chain with this stack.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"steps-to-implement-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-5\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Kick Off the Squad:</strong> Assign a dedicated team from WakeUp Labs to work on the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Test the Espresso Solution:</strong> Conduct thorough testing on a testnet.</li>\n<li><strong>Establish Collaboration:</strong> Create a framework for effective collaboration with the Off Chain Labs and Espresso teams.</li>\n<li><strong>Deploy on Testnet:</strong> Implement Orbit Chains using the Espresso + OffChain Labs decentralized sequencer stack on a testnet.</li>\n<li><strong>Deploy on Mainnet:</strong> Roll out Orbit Chains using the same stack on the mainnet.</li>\n<li><strong>Document the Process:</strong> Record the entire deployment process for both the testnet and mainnet.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous Support and QA:</strong> Provide ongoing support, quality assurance, and testing for the new systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Code Reviews and Improvements:</strong> Conduct regular code reviews, research, and make improvements to both the source code and documentation for Espresso and Arbitrum.</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly Updates:</strong> Communicate progress updates to the community through monthly posts on governance forums.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Analysis:</strong> Analyze the performance of the new mechanisms, focusing on transaction latency, transaction costs, and infrastructure costs, including the benefits for those running these chains.</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment Guide:</strong> Prepare a step-by-step guide for deploying Orbit Chains using decentralized sequencers from Scratch.</li>\n<li><strong>Post-Work Conclusion:</strong> Compile a final summary document evaluating the overall success of the squad.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-6\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Month 1</strong>: Establish a clear working framework, assign a dedicated team, kick off the project, set up communication channels with the DAO, Espresso, and Off-Chain Labs, start testing on the testnet, and provide feedback.</li>\n<li><strong>Months 2-3</strong>: Deploy the first Orbit Chain on the testnet, provide QA and testing support, and document the experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Months 4-5</strong>: Deploy the mainnet Orbit Chain, analyze performance, document findings, prepare guides, and compile a final summary document evaluating the overall success of the squad.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"overall-cost-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overall-cost-7\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p>The total cost for implementing this proposal is <strong>$230,000 ARB</strong>, broken down as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$55,000 as soon as the proposal passes Tally.</li>\n<li>$40,000 per month for 3 months.</li>\n<li>$55,000 upon the final delivery of the Summary Document evaluating the overall success of the squad.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An existing multisignature wallet will be responsible for splitting the payment into the proper tranches.</p>\n<p>To cover a qualified team of three persons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A White Hat Hacker/Researcher, who participated in the Arbitrum challenge - <a href=\"https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum BoLD | Code4rena</a>.</li>\n<li>Sr. Architect Full Stack Developer with extensive Solidity experience.</li>\n<li>Project Owner, able to writte Technical Documentation/Content Writer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"team-information-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#team-information-8\"></a>Team Information</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wakeuplabs.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">WakeUp Labs</a>, fostering transparency, maintains an <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wakeup-labs-general-comms-thread-our-journey-on-arbitrum/25128\">update thread</a> related to its collaboration with Arbitrum.

It assists builders in navigating Arbitrum’s diverse support mechanisms with decentralized and asynchronous guidance while boosting the visibility and reach of support programs to ensure they connect with the right projects. Additionally, it enables supporters to monitor the utilization and impact of these programs, ensuring resources are used effectively and delivering measurable outcomes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Motivation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The current support mechanism within the Arbitrum ecosystem can be challenging for builders to navigate, often resembling an uncharted forest. Implementing cofound3r will provide a structured approach while guiding builders efficiently. Additionally, this proposal will enable the collection of valuable data points on program usage, allowing for data-driven decisions and the design of future programs based on real insights and high-level understanding of their impact.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rationale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are a team of builders sharing the aspiration of making venture building accessible to all. Having firsthand experience with creating our own ventures—including exits, flops, and mergers—we understand the challenges of venture building. Studies show that 74% of projects receiving funding still fail.</p>\n<p>Our experience enabling major organizations such as a Fortune 50 company, multi-country organizations, investment funds, venture studios, and R&amp;D centers has shown that combining financial and operational support significantly increases success rates. Arbitrum DAO has numerous support programs that combine financial with operational support, but lacks a structured system for efficiently matching projects with suitable programs, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.</p>\n<p>Our rationale is based around these three objectives:</p>\n<p>Understanding: Firstly, we aim to assess the key characteristics of any new or existing builder. Based on their specific profile, we can evaluate their current capacity in areas such as business development, financial viability, fundraising maturity, operational excellence, solution readiness, and team structure. We also determine how each project can contribute value to Arbitrum, whether by increasing transactions, attracting new funds, creating awareness, engaging the ecosystem, or enhancing the DAO’s operational capacity.</p>\n<p>Collaborating: Utilizing the captured data points, we provide structured and guided support to individual projects. With numerous initiatives like Arbitrum Hub, the Ambassadors program, Quesbook Grants, Developer Hub, Jobs Portal, Community Initiatives, Arbitrum Education, FireStarters, and RnDAO’s Venture Building program, our solution aims to leverage these existing resources to effectively support each project by directing them to the most appropriate programs for their specific maturity stage and profile.</p>\n<p>Reporting: Finally, we bring value to the community by providing gathered information to delegates, program managers, observers, and other relevant parties. We aim to become the interface for interaction and collaboration in a structured and transparent manner.

in partnership with Arbitrum DAO.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>Orbit chains allow developers to create customizable blockchains that are not only powered by Arbitrum’s technology, but also can be tailored to specific application/project needs.</p>\n<p>The Orbit ecosystem is experiencing growth with the emergence of new projects, such as Sanko and Degen chain. Defi projects in particular face major challenges in terms of initial liquidity support to help them attract new users, and further incremental liquidity (liquidity begets liquidity). This is a problem across all DeFi verticals, and requires initial boot strapping.</p>\n<p>Established liquidity pools on day 1 is an important piece of a toolkit that is currently missing for Orbit projects, both existing and upcoming. Through strategic liquidity provisioning / TVL, we can solve the zero-to-one problem projects face, and one of the top reasons they fail.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>Orbit chains represent a new frontier in blockchain development that <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/new-arb-chains\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">“foster open, permissionless innovation”</a>, attracting builders and users. This initiative reflects Arbitrum DAO’s commitment to provide a pathway to support and grow the Orbit ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"primary-goal-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#primary-goal-4\"></a>Primary Goal</h3>\n<p>Support the growth of Orbit chains by providing sticky, long-term, anti-mercenary liquidity to select projects. Initial long term liquidity serves as a positive flywheel to attract additional TVL and users to Orbit projects, as well as provide support to new builders.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"steps-to-implementation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implementation-5\"></a>Steps to Implementation</h3>\n<p>Central to this proposal is the strategic deployment of ARB paired with other token assets to enhance liquidity across the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem. Targeted liquidity injections foster a robust trading environment that supports stability and growth for both Orbit-native tokens and blue-chip assets. Our approach is designed to optimize ecosystem scalability in both existing and emerging Orbit chains.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Liquidity Provision</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective 1: Deploy ARB tokens paired with the following assets into protocols building on Orbit\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Assets:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ETH</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>WBTC</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>USDC</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amount to Dedicate: 10 million ARB</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective 2: Deploy ARB tokens paired with select Orbit-native tokens into Orbit Chains</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amount to Dedicate: 5 million ARB</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective 3: Deploy ARB tokens paired with select Orbit-native tokens into Arbitrum Mainnet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amount to Dedicate: 5 million ARB</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective 4: Provide ARB token liquidity for bridging between Orbit Chains and Arbitrum Mainnet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amount to Dedicate: 1 million ARB</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/2cadaeea6ae8bd520b1a6a2c42c15718241261cd.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6nf7EglcZDOfq5BYXVhDAY7d4UB.png?dl=1\" title=\"|624x272.6128829533502\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2cadaeea6ae8bd520b1a6a2c42c15718241261cd_2_690x302.png\" alt=\"|624x272.6128829533502\" data-base62-sha1=\"6nf7EglcZDOfq5BYXVhDAY7d4UB\" width=\"690\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2cadaeea6ae8bd520b1a6a2c42c15718241261cd_2_690x302.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2cadaeea6ae8bd520b1a6a2c42c15718241261cd_2_1035x453.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2cadaeea6ae8bd520b1a6a2c42c15718241261cd_2_1380x604.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F3F5F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"orbit-chain-project-qualification-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#orbit-chain-project-qualification-6\"></a>Orbit Chain Project Qualification</h3>\n<p>We take a VC lens to project selection.

The Scaling DevRel for Arbitrum project aims to amplify the creation and dissemination of such resources, empowering developers to build innovative applications and contribute to the expanding Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>The Scaling DevRel for Arbitrum project aligns with the Arbitrum DAO’s mission to foster a decentralized and collaborative ecosystem. By empowering community members to lead educational initiatives, the project promotes inclusivity, knowledge-sharing, and innovation. This approach will not only accelerate the development of technical resources but also cultivate a sense of ownership and engagement within the developer community.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<p>Working Group: A dedicated team of five experienced community members, from the Arbitrum DevRel Fellowship, with proven expertise in Web3 and DevRel will spearhead content creation and community engagement efforts.</p>\n<p>To showcase the team’s expertise and capabilities, we have included links to samples of their previous work below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsQbsop73cfHn2VjMMrrbdBjZFPYEgBp6\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Celo Spark with Nestor</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/24045084f16b55309f62694bd07e285ece14b095.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/58CqPzqZKPqDGKYcquNq5BVZErz.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24045084f16b55309f62694bd07e285ece14b095_2_476x368.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"58CqPzqZKPqDGKYcquNq5BVZErz\" width=\"476\" height=\"368\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24045084f16b55309f62694bd07e285ece14b095_2_476x368.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24045084f16b55309f62694bd07e285ece14b095_2_714x552.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/24045084f16b55309f62694bd07e285ece14b095_2_952x736.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"B5AEB4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ArI1j5zr3s8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Starknet Workshops</a></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/36677be458b9e276b3b1e975d5f1c3f7b8b4a121.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/7LhuNvHkiVKhB5VDkS6kzqtRSDL.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/36677be458b9e276b3b1e975d5f1c3f7b8b4a121_2_483x269.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"7LhuNvHkiVKhB5VDkS6kzqtRSDL\" width=\"483\" height=\"269\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/36677be458b9e276b3b1e975d5f1c3f7b8b4a121_2_483x269.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/36677be458b9e276b3b1e975d5f1c3f7b8b4a121_2_724x403.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/36677be458b9e276b3b1e975d5f1c3f7b8b4a121_2_966x538.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EDEDEF\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>Advisor</strong>: Matt Hamilton, a Senior Developer Advocate from the Arbitrum Foundation, will serve in an advisory role, offering guidance and expertise without receiving compensation.</p>\n<p><strong>Multisig</strong>: A 4-of-6 multisig wallet will be established to manage the funds securely and transparently, with signatories including working group members and community representatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Educational Content</strong>: The working group will produce:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comprehensive video tutorials on Arbitrum Stylus and Orbit</li>\n<li>GitHub repositories with practical examples</li>\n<li>Detailed articles integrating video content and code</li>\n<li>A “workshop in a box” framework that will package up this content for easy distribution and use by other teams, e.g the Arbitrum Ambassador programme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Content Distribution</strong>: The content will be disseminated through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Official Arbitrum channels (website, blog, YouTube)</li>\n<li>Relevant developer platforms</li>\n<li>DevRel Uni cohort (reaching 250+ students across 42 countries)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Transparency and Reporting</strong>: The working group will provide bi-weekly progress updates on the Arbitrum Governance Forum, publish detailed documentation of processes and expenditures, and host monthly community calls.</p>\n<p><strong>Partnership with DevRel University</strong>: DevRel University is a cohort-based programme to train and enable developer relations people, currently having completed 5 cohorts with over 250 people from over 50 countries.

The daoURI, following EIP-4824, will create a single source of truth on the DAO, that cannot be altered by external agencies, is fully manageable via governance, bringing helpful context on the DAO onchain. This will be helpful for newcomers, tooling providers, and experienced governooors alike.</p>\n<p>DAOstar received a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to improve the adoption of EIP-4824 in the Arbitrum ecosystem. We are allocating a portion of that grant to steward this proposal. <strong>Adopting EIP-4824 requires no additional spend from the DAO treasury, and it makes no change to its smart contracts or governance structure.</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO is one of the largest DAOs, and there is a lot of data surrounding it. This dataset grows with every new initiative and has multiple components that may not be very visible from the “outside”. For example, consider the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who are the current Security Council, Arbitrum Research &amp; Development Collective, Procurement Committee members? (Answer: you can search the respective forum post to find this)</li>\n<li>Can you share a location that tracks all DAO-owned/managed multisig addresses? (Answer: this could be <a href=\"https://www.arbwallets.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.arbwallets.xyz/</a>)</li>\n<li>Can you share a status update on the DAO’s grant spending? (Answer: R3gen Finance reports this on the forum)</li>\n<li>Where can we see delegate performance? (Answer: KarmaGAP or Tally)</li>\n<li>How much in sequencer fees is being collected? (Answer: there is a dashboard for this)</li>\n<li>What orbit chains exist? (Answer: the ecosystem page tracks this)</li>\n<li>Where to find recordings and transcripts of public meetings? (Answer: I’m not sure!)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For an active participant, these answers might not be very hard. But for the majority of people who are not active participants of the DAO, and even for tooling providers, collecting this information requires a painstaking amount of manual effort. This leads to inconsistencies, errors and outdated information.</p>\n<p>There are over 200 DAOs at the moment with a treasury size of over $1M, and collecting information on them manually is becoming an exponentially difficult task. EIP-4824 was authored by DAOstar with the support from the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Etherscan, DeepDAO, Snapshot, and a large number of DAO tooling companies, to create a better infrastructure for DAO data.</p>\n<p>Adopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. daoURIs have a standard JSON-LD format:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">{\n\"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n\"type\": \"DAO\",\n\"name\": \"&lt;name of the DAO&gt;\",\n\"description\": \"&lt;description&gt;\",\n\"membersURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"proposalsURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"activityLogURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"governanceURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\",\n\"contractsRegistryURI\": \"&lt;URI&gt;\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It contains information on governance, members, activities and contracts by default. Outside of the endpoints mentioned above, a DAO can also choose to publish information that is specifically important to it. For Arbitrum, this could be information about orbit chains, different multi-sigs and councils, spending, sequencer fees, link to its constitution, etc. Essentially, <strong>the daoURI creates an “official repository” of information on the DAO.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some examples of how the daoURI could be used:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It can be used to bring more context to contracts on block explorers. For example, we could go from this:</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1QMspHKChbZaAlnUGWXZNp0rCKK.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_624x331.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1QMspHKChbZaAlnUGWXZNp0rCKK\" width=\"624\" height=\"331\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_624x331.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_936x496.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cf995318543b004255d3a6d43356990e83dd3b2_2_1248x662.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F8FA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>to this:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sIqiG4h9JSjvKbsmjRAawo9gqyc.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_624x328.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"sIqiG4h9JSjvKbsmjRAawo9gqyc\" width=\"624\" height=\"328\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_624x328.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_936x492.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c9426e91851e4fb2e8f9665e5a78903a84ce2cc0_2_1248x656.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F1F4\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>We can make DAO data easily and freely available to everyone</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, Arbitrum DAO’s current DeepDAO profile misses a ton of info - contracts, or revenue, or governance guardrails (councils and multi-sigs), etc. Messari’s Arbitrum DAO dashboard requires a paid membership to access, which could also be due to the difficulty of collecting and presenting DAO data (thus making it too valuable to give away for free).

This takes away a lot of available information. If we wanted to change this, we could achieve it easily by enforcing a discussionURI field inside the proposalURI (which is a standard component of daoURI). Tally, Aragon, Snapshot X, and most governance tooling providers are members of DAOstar. Extending the standard will create an easy upgrade pathway for them and this change would reflect the change across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>To summarize, a daoURI creates a source of truth for metadata, that can represent the present state of the DAO, and is easily accessible for onchain and offchain tools. This proposal carries no additional cost, or changes to any existing smart contract or process. It’s a step in the right direction with no downside.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>This proposal aligns with the Arbitrum’s mission and <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">community values</a>, by making the Arbitrum DAO more open, accessible, and inclusive to participants and tools alike. The initiative:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>significantly lowers the high threshold of context and background work required to start understanding and meaningfully contributing to the DAO;</li>\n<li>It increases accountability over the board as more information is now freely available;</li>\n<li>It decreases administrative overhead and maintenance as were converging on a single point to publish and consume data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"specifications-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-4\"></a>Specifications</h3>\n<p>Execution is a simple contract call to the EIP-4824 Registration Factory which deploys a new registration contract that’ll store the daoURI. The registration will be on Arbitrum One network, setting the DAO’s Governor timelock as admin, and managers as the DAO decides.</p>\n<p>A DAO that runs the same configuration as Arbitrum DAO and has adopted EIP-4824 is Unlock Protocol. We are adding that transaction here for <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/88514909609252335816460489315313822288366112768901791852399180053604763902892\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">reference</a>, along with successful proposals at <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/treasuregaming.eth/proposal/0x957349f6d60f07e95d6e426536996af96ca63f0b9e0495ee8e73554207cb2381\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Treasure</a> and <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xc25a02d6520fd69ae98ef10b72f3024db2e710d00d51fbc7c03581710e0b8b7b\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1inch</a> that were executed through their respective treasury safes.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"steps-to-implement-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-5\"></a>Steps to Implement</h3>\n<p><strong>Create a daoURI for Arbitrum DAO:</strong> Based on conversations with different contributors during the Arbitrum GovHack, the daoURI can include a description on the DAO, a paginated list of all DAO voters, a list of all proposals (with title, timestamp, status and soon a discussion link), link to governance documents, list of all contracts owned or managed by the DAO, link to dashboards on protocol revenue, orbit chains and delegate performance. It will be stored on IPFS.</p>\n<p>Note that this is a starting point. The daoURI of Arbitrum DAO will continuously evolve and become more comprehensive over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Publish the daoURI onchain:</strong> As detailed in the execution summary above, this will be a simple smart contract call to deploy a new contract on Arbitrum One.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintain the daoURI:</strong> Though daoURI is fully manageable through governance, it may not be practically feasible to initiate an onchain vote for every upgrade. To solve this, the DAO can set one or many <em>manager</em> to manage its daoURI.

This is not just an Arbitrum DAO problem but it affects Arbitrum DAO governance quite a lot. Still to this day, most governance processes in most big DAOs are spread across multiple platforms and systems, from messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Twitter, to Discourse forums, to offchain voting platforms like Snapshot and then to onchain voting front-ends like Tally.</p>\n<p>In each of these platforms, delegates need to keep themselves up to date, review information about proposals coming to vote in the DAO and form their opinions about whether they should support a particular proposal. Delegates are also expected to actively share their concerns and provide feedback on proposals throughout the lifecycle of a proposal so that the proposal can advance through the several stages of the governance process successfully.</p>\n<p>For a delegate, even to the most competent ones, to keep up with all of this information scattered around different sources is… overwhelming, to say the least. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/melting_face.png?v=12\" title=\":melting_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":melting_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>As an example, this is roughly what happens when a delegate (or anybody else for that matter) tries to understand the context and form an opinion about an important Arbitrum proposal like the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/catalyze-gaming-ecosystem-growth-on-arbitrum/22368\">Gaming Catalyst Program</a> that just recently passed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/a/aa6b813b591ad6a5fc0af87fc7e46eec1e9b21d9.gif\" alt=\"How are we even governing ourselves like this?\" data-base62-sha1=\"ojBuSd0BVgexpX3j2X9krCKRMVj\" width=\"576\" height=\"360\" class=\"animated\"></p>\n<p>If we expect more and better delegates to keep up with governance proposals adequately, we should invest in appropriate tooling to make their jobs much easier than they currently are.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>This proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s mission and community values by making the Arbitrum DAO more innovative, open, accessible, and inclusive to delegates and voters by allowing them another choice as users of Arbitrum’s DAO governance.<br>\nMore specifically, the last community value in <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO</a>, but to us, one of the most important community values, the one of attempting to be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Neutral and open:</strong> Arbitrum governance should not pick winners and losers, but should foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition on Arbitrum chains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We know <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tally</a> has a great partnership with the Arbitrum DAO, and we are grateful for all the work the Tally team has done over more than a year to support the governance of Arbitrum DAO. We support their developments and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tallys-arbitrum-roadmap/23223\">future roadmap</a> and are open to collaborating in any way to improve the user experience of delegates and voters in their day-to-day.</p>\n<p>We also believe it is important for the Arbitrum DAO not to be vendor-locked in. More specifically, on the front end it offers its delegates and voters that allows them to participate in Arbitrum DAO’s onchain governance.</p>\n<p>We believe there should be multiple front-ends to Arbitrum DAO’s onchain governance, so that we can attract more and better delegates and voters by providing them tools that suit their particular needs.</p>\n<p>We also strongly believe that at least one of those front-ends should be fully open-source. For the obvious matters of the resilience of Arbitrum’s DAO governance, we believe there should be a fully open-source front-end for Arbitrum’s DAO on-chain governance that would allow delegates and voters to continue to participate in governance permissionlessly. <a href=\"https://proposals.app\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposals.app</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/proposals-app/proposalsapp\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">is fully open source</a> and will continue to be. <a href=\"https://proposals.app\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposals.app</a> and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we’re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>How might we enable <strong>DAO delegates</strong>, to <strong>get a more complete picture of how a proposal has evolved and what other people think about it</strong>, so that <strong>they can make a more informed voting decision</strong>, resulting in <strong>higher quality governance outcomes for the DAO</strong>?</p>\n<p>This guiding question and a bunch of conversations and user research with DAO Delegates both in GovHack and previously when we were building <a href=\"https://x.com/SenateLabs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Senate</a>, has led us to believe that there is a need for a unified view of a canonical DAO proposal page that covers the whole proposal lifecycle, or at the very least, from the “initial Discourse forum post” stage to the “onchain execution” stage, obviously including temperature check poll on Snapshot, and onchain voting.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://proposals.app/?state=all&amp;dao=arbitrum_dao\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposals.app</a> we already fetch Arbitrum’s DAO offchain and onchain proposals, and we also offer free email notifications to anybody that subscribes on the site.

Title</h2>\n<p><strong>Bringing AI Delegates to Arbitrum DAO Governance</strong></p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-abstract-2\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO will delegate 5M ARB, divided equally between 5 AI Voting Agents created by Blockful. Three of these agents will have their “bias prompts” chosen through a JokeRace contest, while the other two will focus on Public Goods Funding and Arbitrum DAO Longevity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-3-motivation-3\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>ARB holders should strive to keep the DAO treasury safe and efficient. However, human delegates may fail to be active. They can also vote contrary to delegators’ preferences, as humans agreeing on a topic might still disagree on others, creating a counter-incentive for delegation by lack of trust and resulting in even lower delegated supply and active voting delegations, which puts the DAO at risk.</p>\n<p>AI Delegates can address these issues: they always vote, maintain a consistent perspective, and are immune to social pressure, lobbying, or bribery.</p>\n<p>By adopting AI Delegates, Arbitrum DAO can improve its governance body, ensuring decisions are made more efficiently, inclusively, and transparently. This proposal aims to create a resilient and adaptive governance tool leveraging the strengths of both human and AI participants.</p>\n<p>Drawing from the insights of the “Event Horizon” proposal, the integration of AI Delegates addresses the fundamental issues of low voter participation and the unpredictability of human delegates. The benefits of this approach include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Consistent and Reliable Voting:</strong> AI Delegates always vote in accordance with their predefined biases, ensuring that the DAO’s decisions are made with consistent logic and reasoning. This reliability addresses one of the major shortcomings of human delegates, who may fail to participate in all votes or be influenced by external factors.</li>\n<li><strong>Elimination of Human Shortcomings:</strong> Human delegates can be influenced by external factors such as lobbying, bribery, and social pressure. AI Delegates are immune to these influences, making them a reliable alternative. This eliminates the risk of votes being swayed by non-transparent factors and ensures that decisions are made based solely on predefined biases and the DAO Dataset.</li>\n<li><strong>Encouragement of Delegation:</strong> By providing a reliable and transparent voting mechanism, AI Delegates can encourage more ARB holders to participate in the governance process through delegation. This addresses the issue of low delegated supply and strengthens the DAO’s governance structure. ARB holders can delegate their voting power to AI Delegates with confidence, knowing that their votes will be cast consistently and transparently.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"h-4-rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-4-rationale-4\"></a>4. Rationale</h2>\n<p>Integrating AI Delegates aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission by enhancing governance quality and security. This initiative provides a reliable delegation option, ensuring diverse preferences are represented. It promotes consistent participation and mitigates risks associated with low voter turnout.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancing Voter Participation and Mitigating Risks:</strong><br>\nAI Delegates ensure consistent voting and are free from external influences such as bribery and social pressures.

This interactive dashboard will provide real-time and historical insights into key metrics that measure developer experience.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"motivation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-8\"></a>Motivation</h4>\n<p>Developers face challenges in finding the right resources, community support, and incentives to build on Arbitrum(especially considering new parts of the tech stack like Stylus and Orbit). There is also no effective system to measure developer satisfaction, engagement, and productivity, leading to suboptimal allocation of resources. Arbitrum Builders Hub aims to address these issues by providing a centralized platform to track and reward developer activities, ultimately improving the overall developer experience and accelerating the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"rationale-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-9\"></a>Rationale</h4>\n<p>By helping us to create this DevEx dashboard, the Arbitrum DAO can demonstrate its commitment to their core values. This will ultimately attract and retain talented developers, creating a thriving and innovative ecosystem long-term. Having data breakdowns about the tooling usage and developer activity will also help align incentives better and create reasonable KPIs for other developer focused programs run by the DAO.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"specifications-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-10\"></a>Specifications</h4>\n<p>Developers using the web app can either preview already existing statistics, public feedback, bug reports, feature requests or authorize to gain access to more features.

They need fast micro-loans, but the market is dominated by loan sharks with insanely high interest rates, which are impossible to pay out, leaving them in a vicious cycle.</p>\n<p>Challenges in accessing financing, along with bureaucracy, are other obstacles that Latin American micro-businesses must overcome to consolidate their growth. Financial institutions do not facilitate sufficiently the access to loans that micro-businesses need to expand their businesses. On the other hand, in general, the process of creating a company is slow, requiring numerous, complex, and costly procedures that delay starting a business.</p>\n<p>DeCredit Score gives local businesses in Latam access to micro-loans, with affordable interest rates, avoiding loan sharks, while protecting investors’ funding and providing them a good risk-managed return on investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>Micro-businesses make up 90% of all economic units in Latin America, and the majority of them depend on micro-loans. The market is dominated by loan sharks, landing micro-credits but at the same time imposing insanely high interest rates (up to 400% a year!). Besides the financial aspect, which creates a strong dependence on micro-loans they can never pay out, there is an alarming underlying security threat for the borrowers and their loved ones. Regular kidnappings or death threats by the hand of loan sharks, followed by a ransom that will be borrowed directly from the same borrowers, creating an infinite loop of debt, are a daily occurrence.</p>\n<p>Micro businesses live in a poverty trap and DeFi can drop these interest rates by about 90%. Studies have shown that access to affordable credit allows micro businesses to grow about 54% a year! We could be unlocking the potential of underdeveloped countries with a solution that allows unsecured credits to leverage the power of web3</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>Real-world assets (RWAs) are underrepresented in Arbitrum, comprising only 1.1% of grants in 2023, and tokenized private credit making up just 0.4% of the global market. Arbitrum should develop an actionable strategy, allocate more resources, and take a leading role in RWAs, aligning with its position of being the Home of DeFi.</p>\n<p>DeCredit Score has the potential to become a tangible use case that brings an Arbitrum based blockchain solution to the masses, attracting thousands of users through word of mouth from trusted contacts and first-hand experience rather than blockchain insiders. By addressing the problem of loan accessibility for micro-businesses, which represent 90% of Latin America’s economic entities, DeCredit Score and Arbitrum will provide tangible value to DeFi and gain significant public traction.</p>\n<p><strong>How Does DeCredit Score Work?</strong><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/d/dd3c6c4a70003845e724654a16d0664ca7082588.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vz8YykuOST4zhTHBin3nJHWPlfG.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Frame 26\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/dd3c6c4a70003845e724654a16d0664ca7082588_2_690x199.jpeg\" alt=\"Frame 26\" data-base62-sha1=\"vz8YykuOST4zhTHBin3nJHWPlfG\" width=\"690\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/dd3c6c4a70003845e724654a16d0664ca7082588_2_690x199.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/dd3c6c4a70003845e724654a16d0664ca7082588_2_1035x298.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/dd3c6c4a70003845e724654a16d0664ca7082588_2_1380x398.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAFAFA\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The micro-business owner (user) registers on the app, creating a smart wallet and getting onboarded to Arbitrum. The user, then, undergoes a KYC process that has two parts: in-app validation of business location, identity, and business permits, followed by on-ground validation by DeCredit Score team members with attestations. This process assigns an initial credit score.</p>\n<p>Next, users create profiles and can add validations (e.g., email, social media, crypto transactions via Bitso, house ownership (through the Ethereum Attestation Service), and payment history) to boost their credit score. Users then can apply for loans, specifying the amount, weekly payments, and justifications (such as business invoices). DeCredit Score doesn’t require collateral initially; instead, each weekly loan payment builds collateral, mitigating risk if payments stop.</p>\n<p>The pilot, with a 200k stablecoin loan pool on ARB, aims to support 100 micro-businesses over six months. Past research* shows micro-businesses often renegotiate loan terms due to vulnerabilities to unexpected events, not lack of commitment. DeCredit Score offers flexible payback terms.</p>\n<p><strong>Pilot KPIs include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of businesses signed up</li>\n<li>Initial and final credit score</li>\n<li>Number of loans paid on time</li>\n<li>Number of renegotiated loans</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To prevent gaming the system, the app uses dID to recognize if users try to open multiple accounts, ensuring the same credit score and verification stamps apply, and blocking new loans if previous ones aren’t repaid.</p>\n<p>*NOTE: DeCredit Score’s database is sourced from a Mexican financial institution that serves micro-businesses.

Our proposed track sought to surface relevant information and recommend gradual steps toward decentralizing aspects of the Arbitrum sequencer, such as enabling faster bridging via decentralized preconfirmations.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Arbitrum’s sequencer is centralized, and while this might serve the purposes of the community today, it is necessary for the DAO to consider the implications of decentralizing the sequencer. In addition, Offchain Labs and Espresso are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@espressosys/espresso-systems-and-offchain-labs-release-r-d-roadmap-for-decentralized-timeboost-5d0007dff66d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">collaborating</a> on r&amp;d towards decentralizing Timeboost, suggesting the necessity for the DAO to begin having such discussions.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"key-terms-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-3\"></a>Key Terms</h1>\n<p>Sequencer: entity responsible for collecting and ordering users’ transactions</p>\n<p>Liveness (uptime):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Arbitrum One chain keeps processing user transaction</li>\n<li>censorship resistance i.e honest transactions get included in Arbitrum without bias towards individual users or applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>guarantee that a transaction does not revert</li>\n<li>latency: time to achieve finality</li>\n<li>pre-confirmation: a promise that a user’s transaction will eventually be a part of the finalized Arbitrum state. Can also be seen as a type of finality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum sequencer has two primary tasks: ordering transactions into blocks, and providing a guarantee that blocks won’t revert prior to posting a batch to Ethereum. In other words, the sequencer is in charge of building blocks and of providing a preconfirmation.</p>\n<p>Block building entails choosing which transactions to include, thus a centralized sequencer has control over which transactions end up making it into the Arbitrum chain. This leads to the first critique: a lack of censorship resistance and neutrality.</p>\n<p>Beyond censorship, the fact that only a single sequencer can build blocks means that if that sequencer goes down, the Arbitrum chain is effectively halted till the sequencer comes back online (barring using the escape hatch). This is commonly referred to as the liveness property of a protocol.</p>\n<p>Decentralizing block building can thus improve upon the status quo, by improving the censorship resistance and liveness guarantees of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The preconfirmation provided by the centralized sequencer provides best in class UX for the vast majority of transactions on Arbitrum, however, third-party bridges often don’t want to rely on this preconfirmation, especially for high volume transactions. This is to avoid the risk of an issue with the centralized sequencer causing a bridging transaction to revert, which can lead to an economic loss.</p>\n<p>Instead, these bridges default to waiting for a batch that includes a bridging transaction from Arbitrum to finalize on Ethereum, which ensures that it wont revert. This is why third-party bridges often take 15+ minutes to bridge funds out of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>It is possible to retain centralized control over block building, but add a decentralized preconfirmation protocol to gradually decentralize the sequencer over time. We’d like to propose for the Arbitrum DAO to consider integrating decentralized preconfirmations as a first step towards decentralized sequencing. This imposes minimal changes to how the protocol presently works. Instead it can be seen as an additive layer of security.</p>\n<p>As an example of how this might works, imagine a new consensus protocol similar to the one employed by the Ethereum L1, except this new consensus protocol reaches finality in a manner of seconds. Arbitrum blocks will then receive a preconfirmation from this new consensus protocol, prior to being posted to Ethereum. This allows third-party bridges to safely settle transactions in a matter of seconds. It is worth noting that Arbitrum can still maintain its 0.2s block time in this design.</p>\n<p>By implementing decentralized preconfirmations as a first step, the DAO can improve UX around bridging, and give itself more time to explore the trade-off space related to completely decentralizing the sequencer. Below we’d like to introduce some of those trade-offs as a starting point for further discussion.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"tradeoffs-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tradeoffs-5\"></a>Tradeoffs</h1>\n<p><em>Centralized Sequencing:</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"pros-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pros-6\"></a>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Already live today, no extra work needed.</li>\n<li>Guarantees fast pre-confirmation (the speed at which you receive notification from your wallet when you submit a transaction on Arbitrum).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"cons-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#cons-7\"></a>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Trust issues: Reliance on the sequencer not to censor or reorder transactions.</li>\n<li>Increased downtime risk (which has occurred a few times in the past for Arbitrum).</li>\n<li>Regulatory vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>Geographical centralization (co-location and regulatory risks)</li>\n<li>Slower bridging for high-value transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Decentralized Sequencing:</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"pros-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pros-8\"></a>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Real-time liveness/censorship resistance: If one operator goes down or censors transactions, another can step in to ensure the chain continues processing transactions.</li>\n<li>Practical liveness/censorship resistance: If the sequencer goes down and there are no other sequencers, users would need to force include their transactions (see this <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wakeup-labs-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/25134\">proposal</a>). This would involve direct interaction with Ethereum, which is a) longer (24 hours) and b) more costly. In scenarios where time equals money, this could be very detrimental for certain users.</li>\n<li>Regulatory: Regulatory guidance around centralized operators (even for permissionless systems) has not been provided. While there are no immediate requirements, this is an area to be mindful of going forward.</li>\n<li>Ethos: Truly decentralized applications include broad community participation and ownership. Permissionless and decentralized operators further this goal.</li>\n<li>Bridging: Faster finality for high value bridged transactions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"cons-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#cons-9\"></a>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Potentially slower pre-confirmations</li>\n<li>New code stack introduces potential new risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"desirability-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#desirability-10\"></a>Desirability:</h1>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lineabuild/status/1797283493778710949?s=46\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Linea Case Study</a></em>: A few weeks ago, a hacker drained an application on Linea, causing the loss of user funds. The Linea team had to stop the sequencer to censor the hacker’s addresses. In this case, operating a centralized sequencer serves as a tool to mitigate the damage from exploits.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if there had been significant price movement during that period, lending protocols could not have liquidated positions, potentially causing bad debt - an undesirable outcome. This situation also highlights how, even though the hacker would have been able to fully drain users’ funds, decentralized sequencing could prevent a scenario in which other users accumulate bad debt.</p>\n<p>These are trade-offs that the DAO should weigh when considering the implications of decentralizing the sequencer. However, we do know that the protocol takes a less opinionated stance with a decentralized sequencer. It is worth noting that merely decentralizing the preconfirmations has no impact on this question.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"potential-further-work-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#potential-further-work-11\"></a>Potential Further Work</h1>\n<p>Offchain Labs and Espresso are already working on a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GHPFWMQOwCk?list=PLpktWkixc1gX-L5NT-vuDP54kW--3gDnK&amp;t=390\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">decentralized version</a> of <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167\">Timeboost</a> which can enable decentralized sequencing. This means that at some point the DAO will have to make a decision on this topic.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to continue the work and discussions raised here and from an <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-5-backup-sequencers/21547\">earlier GovHack proposal</a> in order to scope a path toward potentially decentralizing the sequencer. The first step we introduce is decentralized preconfirmations for faster bridging. Other potential work includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investigate the economics of centralized sequencing vs decentralized sequencing.\n<ul>\n<li>How will the protocol bootstrap and/or reward Timeboost operators?</li>\n<li>Can we measure the economic trade-offs?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Highlight the mechanism design of centralized Timeboost, decentralized Timeboost, and Timeboost’s compatibility with Espresso.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"final-thoughts-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#final-thoughts-12\"></a>Final thoughts</h1>\n<p>After discussing with community members and the expert panel at GovHack, we have decided to continue working on this proposal asynchronously. This effort will involve consulting with delegates, other community members, Offchain Labs, and Espresso. Our aim is to gather and present the necessary information to facilitate informed decision-making for the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a
