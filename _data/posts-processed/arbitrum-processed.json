Therefore the plan for incentivizing the most productive and valuable yield bearing liquidity on Balancer will not be carried out using ARB going forward. Balancer’s core pool cycle will continue however, meaning fee redirection will incentivize veBAL holders to vote for high performing pools on Arbitrum as part of our continuous flywheel.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of incentives:</strong> Balancer’s ARB incentive strategy aims to direct BAL tokens toward established gauges on Arbitrum, thereby boosting the most lucrative liquidity pools in terms of both returns and fees for liquidity providers. By leveraging Balancer’s core pool mechanisms along with the STIP Addendum boost settings, this approach seeks to create a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem for the most valuable asset classes on Arbitrum within Balancer. The goal is to optimize the capital efficiency of ARB incentives, benefiting both the Arbitrum ecosystem and the Balancer DAO. For a comprehensive overview of the incentive structure, please check our <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-balancer-stip-addendum/23288\">Addendum</a> post.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Balancer has formed several partner integrations that have enhanced the flow of ARB through our collaborating teams. This includes strong collaborations with Aave and Gyroscope, which enabled Gyroscope’s Rehype pools to tap into the yields from Aave’s lending markets, including GHO, resulting in increased net ARB for Balancer LPs. The Galaxe team has been able to leverage quests for Balancer and Arbitrum to draw in more new users and is concluding soon. This type of new engagement is invaluable to both of our ecosystems,</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/sjx8CuUfwDGWnjdhUQfrG4sDATs.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Balancer x Galaxe Arbitrum Quests\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"Balancer x Galaxe Arbitrum Quests\" data-base62-sha1=\"sjx8CuUfwDGWnjdhUQfrG4sDATs\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/c/c6722a8a581bd337b9fe20ea9340309969e98b06.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"34383A\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Check out the quest board <a href=\"https://app.galxe.com/quest/Balancer/GCskLtvDZi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The fight for the top interest bearing stablecoins and ETH derivatives has come to a conclusion in terms of the STIP but the BAL and AURA saga is far from over.</p>\n<p>Across this week we have seen a 13% decrease in daily average fees, TVL has stayed relatively flat, and we noticed a rotation of capital towards stablecoins with the only upward TVL metric of 4.6% in USD terms.</p>\n<p>The full distribution with quantities can be seen in this <a href=\"https://app.onchainden.com/safes/arb1:0xb6BfF54589f269E248f99D5956f1fDD5b014D50e/transactions/0xdd198b5380a6845e1813647374482eb6c286ceb9ad2463f48440bc6f1db565e3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">transaction</a> and will be repeated in one week to have the same ratio of rewards distributed for a full two week epoch.

Being a member of the security council would align with our team’s mission, having already been part of the zkSync security council and having worked for various stakeholders in the Arbitrum and greater Ethereum community. You can find further information about our application below:</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-59050-motivation-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59050-motivation-1\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>At Dedaub, our fundamental mission is to enhance the security and resilience of the Web3 ecosystem. We are committed to safeguarding decentralized platforms and building trust within the community. Joining the Arbitrum Security Council represents an opportunity for us to extend our positive impact by collaborating with like-minded professionals dedicated to safeguarding a major ecosystem. Our previous initiatives, such as being a founding member of the Security Alliance (<a href=\"https://securityalliance.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://securityalliance.org</a>), memberships in other security councils, and security vulnerability disclosures on 3rd party protocols such as Uniswap reflect our commitment to this cause.</p>\n<p>A secondary motivation is that we have a number of our partners (e.g. the Arbitrum DAO procurement committee) and clients such as GMX and Pendle rely on the security of the Arbitrum network, further aligning us with this role. Therefore, we believe that by contributing our expertise to the Arbitrum Security Council, we can help fortify the platform, ensuring a safer environment for its users and stakeholders.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-59050-relevant-experience-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59050-relevant-experience-2\"></a>Relevant Experience</h1>\n<p>Dedaub brings a wealth of experience in blockchain security and smart contract auditing. Our team has conducted security audits and security impact studies for the Ethereum Foundation, ensuring the Ethereum ecosystem evolves in a secure manner. Additionally, we are a member of the security council for zkSync, which presents similar challenges to being a security council member on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Our experience extends to auditing important projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem, such as GMX. We have also actively participated in high-stakes bug bounty programs and emergency response scenarios. One such example is our security disclosure on the Multichain bridge, whereby we helped move $1B in various tokens that were immediately at risk. There are many other examples of ecosystem threats whereby the Dedaub team was roped in to help in a war room scenario. Experiences like this demonstrate our ability to perform under pressure and deliver effective solutions.</p>\n<p>Being a founding member of the Security Alliance underscores our collaborative approach to industry-wide security challenges. Additionally, our role as a security advisor to the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) has allowed us to influence procurement strategies with a security-first mindset. This diverse experience equips us with the insights and skills necessary to contribute meaningfully to the Arbitrum Security Council.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-59050-other-legal-considerations-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-59050-other-legal-considerations-3\"></a>Other Legal Considerations</h1>\n<p>Dedaub is Domiciled and Resident in Malta, a crypto-friendly jurisdiction.

The change only involves a modification of an existing configuration parameter and does not introduce any new functionality.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-overview-2\"></a>Overview</h3>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has a governance process whereby the community can vote on proposals fully on-chain. Two distinct kinds of proposals can be passed: those that spend funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s ETH treasury and those that perform upgrades to the contracts governing the system. In either case, there is currently a 3-day delay between the time a proposal has passed and when it is executed. While the same delay applies for both types of proposal, the former is governed by the L2 Treasury Time Lock while the latter is governed by the L2 Core Time Lock. As such, the delays for each proposal type are independent and any changes made to one will not necessarily impact the other.</p>\n<p>While these delays are in place, the Security Council can always step in to stop malicious proposals. However, the delay gives the Security Council the time to act in the event that a malicious proposal is indeed passed. In addition, it provides users the opportunity to withdraw their assets in the event that they are dissatisfied with the changes that would result from a proposal. The proposal would increase the delay applied to the L2 Core Time Lock from 3 days to 8 days. All proposals regarding spending funds from the ArbitrumDAO ETH treasury would still maintain a delay of 3 days. Only constitutional proposals related to smart contract upgrades would be affected.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>The primary motivation for this change is to increase the aforementioned security benefits. Namely, an increased delay will give the Security Council more time to review and stop malicious proposals (which is already a technical and lengthy process), while also providing users more time to make an informed decision. Furthermore, the proposal mentions a <a href=\"https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">framework developed by L2BEAT</a> as part of the motivation behind it. More specifically, it will change the color of <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum’s ‘Exit Window’ slice</a> on <a href=\"https://gov.l2beat.com/t/the-risk-rosette-framework/292\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2BEAT’s Risk Rosette</a> from red to yellow.</p>\n<p>By only increasing the delay on the L2 Core Time Lock, a compromise is achieved between security and speed. Since constitutional proposals are much more complex in nature, the Security Council requires more time to review these proposals than those directed towards the treasury. This timelock delay increase would provide the necessary time to review these potentially complex proposals while the traditional proposals regarding treasury spending adhere to the existing process. The downside of increasing this delay is that constitutional proposals will now take an extra 5 days to execute. No additional costs or security risks are introduced to the system as the proposed changes only modify one configuration parameter.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-technical-details-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-technical-details-4\"></a>Technical Details</h3>\n<p>No new functionality needs to be introduced for this change. The value of the existing <code>_minDelay</code> parameter would be changed from 259200 to 691200 in the <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0#readProxyContract\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">L2 Timelock</a> contract. Note that the units of this parameter are in seconds, so the change is from 3 days to 8 days as explained earlier. The <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">action contract</a> has already been implemented and is pending an audit. It consists of a <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306/files#diff-aa7423831f93d30e4ebfa2052f0b1e3a90b2d90cd1e76ee2d074d47c6b17a82c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">contract</a> that has a function called <code>perform</code> which:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Calls the <code>L2AddressRegistry</code> contract deployed on Arbitrum at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x56C4E9Eb6c63aCDD19AeC2b1a00e4f0d7aBda9d3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x56C4E9Eb6c63aCDD19AeC2b1a00e4f0d7aBda9d3</a> to get the value of the <code>coreGovTimelock</code> state variable. Currently, the value of this variable is the address of the contract deployed at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0</a>.</li>\n<li>Calls the <code>updateDelay()</code> function of the stored <code>coreGovTimelock</code> contract with the new value of <code>86400 * 8</code>. Note that 86400 is 24 hours in seconds, so this would effectively update the delay to 8 days as described. This function, in turn, sets the <code>_arbMinDelay</code> to this new value and emits an event. No other changes occur.\n<ul>\n<li>Using the same <code>coreGovTimelock</code> contract, the <code>getMinDelay()</code> function is called to ensure that the new value of <code>_arbMinDelay</code> reflects the proposed change.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Calls the <code>L2Registry</code> contract once again, this time retrieving the value of the <code>arbitrumDAOConstitution</code> state variable. Currently, the value of this variable is the address of the contract deployed at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1D62fFeB72e4c360CcBbacf7c965153b00260417\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x1D62fFeB72e4c360CcBbacf7c965153b00260417</a>.</li>\n<li>Calls the <code>setConstitutionHash</code> function with the new value of <code>0x28faf2acba9b3ff80ec484e3d5646931eeef40568b1b7c38dbe52b890bfd7938</code>. This reflects the changes made to the constitution text which are discussed further below. This function, in turn, sets the <code>constitutionHash</code> state variable and emits an event. No other changes occur.\n<ul>\n<li>Using the same <code>arbitrumDAOConstitution</code> contract, the <code>constitutionHash()</code> getter for this state variable is called to ensure that the new value of <code>constitutionHash</code> reflects this change.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <code>CoreGovTimelockUpdateDelayEightDayAction</code> contract already seems to have been deployed on the Arbitrum network at <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5B947D8bF197467be7ef381b7cAfEE0A7B35737A#code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">0x5B947D8bF197467be7ef381b7cAfEE0A7B35737A</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">current constitution</a> of the Arbitrum DAO has been modified with the following changes:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"diff\"><code class=\"lang-diff\">- Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, a 3 day waiting period occurs. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.\n+ Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 or 8 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, there is a 3 day waiting period for actions related to the DAO Treasury and an 8 day waiting period for an L2-to-L1 Message. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.\n\n- Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the 3 day waiting period in Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.\n+ Phase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the waiting period for Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.\n</code></pre>\n<p>A <code>keccak256</code> hash of the full constitution text was used to generate the value mentioned above. Based on independent review from the ARDC, these changes have been verified to produce the same hash as mentioned by the team. This can be verified by following the same <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#constitution-hash\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">instructions for generating the hash</a> as outlined by the team, with the new changes to the constitution reflected. Note that the <code>CoreGovTimelockUpdateDelayEightDayAction</code> contract has not been directly audited and any calls are not guaranteed to succeed. However, the functionality would only execute if the changes are successfully performed. In addition, no other changes are proposed beyond those explicitly mentioned in the proposal.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-58873-conclusion-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58873-conclusion-5\"></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We found the timelock delay increase proposal to be a reasonable compromise between increased security and maintaining the existing benefits of speedy treasury proposals. This will enable Arbitrum to transition into a more mature rollup that operates independently of any centralized actors, as outlined by the L2BEAT framework. Moreover, the proposal provides added security to reduce the possibility of malicious contract upgrades being executed, while also increasing the amount of time a user has to act on a proposal. The changes described in the proposal have been verified and exactly match those that are currently pending execution on-chain.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-l2-time-lock-delay-proposal-security-review/26837\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-l2-time-lock-delay-proposal-security-review/26837","pubDate":"Wed, 18 Sep 2024 10:11:54 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26837"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-l2-time-lock-delay-proposal-security-review/26837.rss","#text":"Arbitrum L2 Time Lock Delay Proposal Security Review"},"filter":false},{"title":"Zeroknowledge - Candidate for Security Council Elections 2024","dc:creator":"zeroknowledge","category":"General","description":"<p>I bring over 20 years of deep experience in security and cryptography, having worked as both a researcher and consultant. My journey has led me to work with some of the most well-known research groups in security and cryptography across academia and industry, including Microsoft Research. I have also collaborated with top-tier financial institutions like AIB, HSBC, Lloyds, and Zurich. My expertise in blockchain dates back to the early days of the technology, with involvement in key projects like Ripple, Ethereum Swarm, multiple DeFi protocols, and privacy-focused DeFi initiatives.</p>\n<p>Background</p>\n<p>As a cypherpunk who has been active since the days of sci.crypt and the cryptography mailing lists, and having attended graduate school to study cryptography, I’ve been immersed in the blockchain ecosystem since its infancy. I’m also one of the founding members of the UK Digital Currency Association (UKDCA). My early contributions include advising Ripple and reviewing the Ethereum Swarm (Orange) project. I have been an early contributor to the token engineering and protocol design space, giving multiple talks and workshops on the topic. Blockchain has been a core part of my professional life, and I’ve continuously advocated for privacy and security innovations, including co-founding Panther Protocol, which leverages advanced cryptography for DeFi.</p>\n<p>Security and Cryptography Expertise</p>\n<p>My background in security began early, and over the years, I’ve honed my expertise in safeguarding complex systems. As CTO and Chief Scientist of Panther Protocol, I’ve led efforts to implement cutting-edge, privacy-preserving solutions in decentralized finance.

There are no issues with the proposed design at this time.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58861-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58861-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Financial markets reward first actors. Because Arbitrum’s Sequencer is “first come, first serve” and fully open, anyone that sees an opportunity to make a profit can send a transaction to realize the gain. The trouble is that a lot of these opportunities become visible to the entire market at the same time, incentivizing all market actors to send a transaction to the network in the hope that they’re first. The first motivation for this AIP is to address <a href=\"https://status.arbitrum.io/clq6te1l142387b8n5bmllk9es\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">spikes in network traffic that have caused the Sequencer to go down in the past</a>. This AIP works toward smoothing out the spikes by removing the incentive for <em>everyone</em> to send transactions to the market. It removes this incentive by creating an auction for the right to jump the transaction line for a period of time (one minute is suggested). If someone has the right to jump in front of you, there’s no incentive to race to be first. This ties into a second described motivation for the AIP: by auctioning this right, the DAO can be compensated for providing these financial opportunities in the first place. The auction and it’s surrounding infrastructure is designed by Offchain Labs, with Espresso Systems collaborating, and is called “Timeboost.”</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58861-review-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58861-review-2\"></a>Review</h2>\n<p>This AIP is in it’s theoretical phase. There is no code or decentralized version today, but community approval would grant Offchain Labs and Espresso Systems the runway to develop those things. Those details are where most of our security concerns will be so we look forward to reviewing their work when it’s available. The auction mechanics are sound and use well-understood methods. The roles in the system and their responsibilities are well separated and as simple as can be. We have no security concerns about the centralized version of Timeboost as it is described in this AIP.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/timeboost-security-analysis/26832\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/timeboost-security-analysis/26832","pubDate":"Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:19:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26832"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/timeboost-security-analysis/26832.rss","#text":"Timeboost Security Analysis"},"filter":false},{"title":"17 September 2024 - Start of Security Council Elections(!) & Roundup of Active/Upcoming Votes","dc:creator":"raam","category":"Weekly Voting Reminders","description":"<h2><a name=\"p-58812-security-council-election-reminder-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58812-security-council-election-reminder-1\"></a>Security Council Election Reminder <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/alarm_clock.png?v=12\" title=\":alarm_clock:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":alarm_clock:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/2\">Security Council Election Registrations are open (till Sept 22)</a></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Potential candidates have until September 22 to register for the Security Council elections (September 2024 cohort) on <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/2\">Tally</a></li>\n<li>The security council is a committee of 12 members who are signers of a multi-sig wallet, tasked with executing Emergency and Non-Emergency Actions to uphold the ArbitrumDAO’s Constitution</li>\n<li>Check out the resources below to find out more:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/security-council-elections-101/16314\">Security Council Elections 101 Forum Post</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/arbitrum/status/1830655551702712788\">X Thread</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-to-register-as-a-candidate/16364\">How to register as a Candidate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/security-council-members-duties-and-principles/16313\">Duties and principles of Security Council members</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58812-onchain-proposals-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58812-onchain-proposals-2\"></a>Onchain Proposals <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ballot_box.png?v=12\" title=\":ballot_box:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":ballot_box:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/104013508427929791254647754028304659752687979030673391997226897145800989991969\">Ethereum Protocol Attackathon Sponsorship</a> (Voting starts on Sept 20)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ethereum Foundation is seeking sponsorship from the ArbitrumDAO to support an “Attackathon,” a large-scale security audit event organized by the Ethereum Foundation and hosted on the Immunefi platform.

The ARB will be converted by the Arbitrum Foundation only when macroeconomic conditions improve and the total amount obtained is similar to or higher than the first iteration (which got $30 million). The goal of the STEP program is treasury diversification along with ecosystem growth for Real World Asset (RWA) protocols on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal kickstarts the next version of the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stable Treasury Endowment Program</a>, which aims to grow the RWA ecosystem (many of the top protocols do not need grants so much as AUM for their product) while simultaneously diversifying our treasury into stable, liquid and yield-generating assets (the volatility of the ARB token has highlighted the need for prudent diversification based on fixed targets).</p>\n<p>The RWA sector is currently $12 billion (it was $1 billion at the time of STEP 1), growing at leaps and bounds with much room to grow even further considering the US treasury market by itself is $20 trillion. To stay on top of this competitive sector, we need reliability and consistency in the programs we run for this vertical.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we have seen increasing interest in treasury diversification initiatives across Arbitrum DAO. We propose 3 clear principles to follow in dealing with service providers proposing to help with Arbitrum treasury diversification;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Directly own the process of selecting stable assets providing yield rather than delegating to a treasury manager (no point paying 1% AUM for them to hold low-risk assets on our behalf).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The STEP program is an example of how this can take place: an RFP under which projects apply with their product; a committee to review applicants; a program manager to monitor selected products</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Diversify the treasury in a manner that also promotes ecosystem growth, by conducting a competitive process where the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO selecting a providers asset is as valuable as the business they get from it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Accordingly, have projects directly apply in a competitive process on our forum if they want us to diversify into their product and be ratified in some way through a vote, not privately approach a treasury manager to get included</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Use fixed targets for conversion to obtain a better bang for our ARB and reject treasury managers proposing point-in-time diversification below the target</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We propose additional treasury diversification take place at a rate close to or higher than the first STEP program. Since we already have $30 million converted into stable RWAs, there is no urgency for more diversification at a significantly lower price.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>In mid-2024, Arbitrum DAO diversified $30 million into stable, liquid &amp; yield generating RWAs. A comprehensive RFP process was undertake, where the DAO received 33 applications from RWA issuers, of which 16 were shortlisted and 6 were finally selected for allocations: Securitize BUIDL ($9.57 million), Ondo USDY ($5.22 million), Superstate USTB ($5.22 million), Mountain USDM ($3.48 million), OpenEden TBill ($3.48 million), and Backed Finance bIB01 ($3.48 million). These allocations helped us diversify the treasury into dollar denominated assets, got selected providers to launch on Arbitrum and are expected to generate a yield of roughly $1-1.5 million per year for our treasury.</p>\n<p>While the 1st program narrowly targeted low-risk and liquid instruments (primarily US treasury bills and money market instruments), the second version will expand its scope to include products in private credit, equities, commodities and global bonds. We saw breakout interest from service providers with such products in the 1st version of STEP and had to turn down the majority of them due to a limited mandate. The dashboard at <a href=\"http://rwa.xyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">rwa.xyz</a> lists these categories as fast-growing and we should be at the forefront of nurturing such products.</p>\n<p>Overall, this proposal aims to achieve 3 broad objectives;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Show that Arbitrum has a plan for the RWA vertical and such projects should build on our chain, by expanding the STEP program to more categories than just U.S. treasuries</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Let the DAO directly own stable RWAs through a competitive selection process for providers, instead of paying 1% AUM to treasury managers for selecting and holding low risk assets on our behalf. Use yield from the products to cover operational expenses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provision funds ahead of time for optimal execution, so that the next STEP program is of a roughly similar value or higher than the last one ($30 million) at the same price tag, by waiting until the right macroeconomic conditions before liquidating the budgeted ARB</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will transfer 35 million ARB to the same foundation managed wallet (0xe41d54471EfA03eFF6365795f60545F3cAF7C97e) used in the initial STEP program</li>\n<li>The foundation will at their discretion either set limit orders for ARB or liquidate after average ARB price over the last month is close to or higher than the amount received for the initial STEP program</li>\n<li>The Arbitrum Foundation announces availability of funds on the forum after completion of orders, kickstarting the next phase of an RFP for RWA projects to apply under on the governance forum</li>\n<li>While funds are awaiting optimal execution or soon after, proposals are passed ratifying the RFP, committee composition for selection of providers, asset types, eligibility criteria for STEP 2 and other required details for running the program</li>\n<li>Funds are allocated to selected providers after ratification by the DAO</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Steps to Implement</strong></p>\n<p>The focus of this proposal is ensuring we have sufficient time to optimally convert and receive adequate funds for the next STEP program, along with laying out some general guidelines for treasury diversification into stable assets (no AUM % fees on stable assets, focus on ecosystem growth in diversification, do not diversify when macroeconomic conditions are poor).</p>\n<p>Concurrently, the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-ii-steering-committee/26074\">STEP steering committee</a> (not involved in this proposal) is putting forth its own implementation budget to complete its research on STEP such as types of assets, eligibility criteria, liquidation methods, selection procedures and more. These deliverables will come into play after we are ready to run the next iteration of the program, upon successful conversion of the ARB into stables by the foundation, at a price similar to or higher than the last iteration of STEP.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>\n<p>Forum Discussion: September</p>\n<p>Snapshot vote: After first report from STEP 1 is released</p>\n<p>Tally vote: After first yield from STEP 1 comes into our treasury</p>\n<p>Indefinite : Waiting for optimal conditions before commencing diversification at a rate either higher than STEP 1 or not significantly below it</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong></p>\n<p>Work on this proposal has been funded by Thrivecoin’s ThankArbitrum Firestarter program, so there are no implementation costs baked into this proposal.

This bot has already been deployed in 100+ communities, including Optimism, Celo, Aave, Aragon, Shardeum, etc. <strong>The permissions are configured to be low-risk</strong> (no admin permission, no managing channels, etc. so even if the bot was hacked, the discord and discourse servers wouldn’t be compromised) and we have battle-tested for scalability and reliability.</p>\n<p>The analyses of the data are performed by the TogetherCrew team of scientists and our research partners at the University of California Santa Barbara. Those handling the data have undergone ethical data management training and could lose their academic credentials for unethical conduct.</p>\n<p>The architecture has been developed by our tech lead who’s ex-Accenture and built a data startup in the medical industry. So although the data we manage is low risk (no private data, only public handles, etc.) we’re still investing in data security progressively.</p>\n<p>We don’t use the data to train any AI models.

Chaos Labs supports the proposal, viewing it as a safe upgrade, but we do highlight several minor economic risks.</p>\n<p>Despite these minor concerns, Chaos Labs’ find no major blockers to the proposal’s implementation from an economic perspective.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58637-description-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-description-1\"></a>Description</h1>\n<p>Timeboost is a proposed upgrade that would affect the way transactions are ordered in Arbitrum blocks. A summary of this proposal is included here for ease of reference.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-current-transaction-ordering-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-current-transaction-ordering-2\"></a>Current Transaction Ordering</h2>\n<p>Transactions on Arbitrum are currently ordered on a first-come, first-serve basis (FCFS) . There are no priority fees, meaning that the value created by time-sensitive transactions accrues to searchers and does not flow back to the DAO.</p>\n<p>First-come-first-serve transaction ordering has served Arbitrum chains well to date by allowing extremely fast block times. The default is 250ms, but this can go as low as 100ms, providing Orbit chains with the low latency needed for specialized gaming and DeFi applications.</p>\n<p>Harmful MEV such as frontrunning and sandwich attacks are prevented as there is no way to priortize any transaction earlier in a block.</p>\n<p>First-Come-First-Serve is also simple for teams to understand, implement and operate. This is a significant benefit to teams deploying Orbit chains using the Arbitrum tech stack.</p>\n<p>One consequence of FCFS transaction ordering is that it results in actors spamming the network when opportunities for MEV present themselves. Searchers submit multiple orders to capture MEV opportunities such as arbitrage and backrunning, in the hope that one of them is routed to the sequencer first.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-timeboost-transaction-ordering-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-timeboost-transaction-ordering-3\"></a>Timeboost Transaction Ordering</h2>\n<p>Timeboost improves on the current Arbitrum transaction ordering policy by creating an express lane, giving the auction winner’s transactions a time advantage for inclusion at the sequencer. This is implemented by introducing a latency for normal transactions defined by the NonExpressDelayMsec parameter, while the auction winner’s transactions will be sequenced and included immediately.</p>\n<p>This creates a market for prioritizing transactions, while keeping the transaction costs for regular transactions comparable to the first-come, first-served (FCFS) model. By introducing market-based pricing for priority transactions, time-sensitive transactions cost approximately their long-term value, boosting sequencer revenue without affecting the cost structure for the majority of transactions.</p>\n<p>Auction participants need to deposit funds (for making bids) into the auction contract ahead of time and bid for express lane control for the upcoming round, which lasts 60 seconds. The auction closes 15 seconds before the start of the next round.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that Timeboost increases latency slightly for non-express lane transactions, while express lane transactions latency remains the same as under FCFS. This means that the express lane owner has their transactions included amongst regular transactions submitted to the sequencer NonExpressDelayMsec milliseconds prior. The timing of inclusion of express lane transactions remains uncertain for this reason, but where previously unknown profitable opportunities emerge, the express lane owner will have a healthy advantage to capitalize on them.</p>\n<p>For more details on Timeboost, see the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167\">original post</a>, and follow-up FAQs.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58637-economic-impacts-and-risks-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-economic-impacts-and-risks-4\"></a>Economic Impacts and Risks</h1>\n<p>Timeboost is extremely likely to achieve its stated objectives of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To allow the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.</li>\n<li>To offer the Arbitrum DAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The increased latency for non-express lane transactions will significantly reduce the incentive to submit multiple orders to capture MEV in most cases. Searchers should rationally assume that the express lane controller will use its latency advantage to capture most of these and not bother trying.</p>\n<p>At the same time, assuming at least two independent and competitive parties bid for the express lane, this latency advantage should be valued relative to the expected MEV opportunities in each round. This will increase revenues for the Arbitrum DAO without increasing the fees regular users pay, maximizing the potential for ecosystem growth in an economically sustainable way.</p>\n<p>While Chaos Labs generally views the Timeboost proposal as a positive step forward for Arbitrum chains and a safe upgrade to first-come, first-serve transaction ordering, we recommend monitoring for a number of potential second-order effects of this upgrade. It is not apparent exactly how the marketplace for the express lane will develop ex-ante. In this section, we highlight some possible ways this marketplace could develop and the associated risks.</p>\n<p>Should either of these or other unknown risks materialize, further iteration on Timeboost could be necessary in the future. The risks highlighted below are meant to serve as a preemptive set of second-order behaviors to monitor rather than any blockers to the rollout of Timeboost from an economic risk perspective.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-secondary-markets-for-the-express-lane-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-secondary-markets-for-the-express-lane-5\"></a>Secondary Markets for the Express Lane</h2>\n<p>A likely scenario is that secondary markets develop for access to the express lane where searchers compensate the express lane controller for access when they need it. Should this occur, the express lane becomes more valuable and therefore the auctions should clear at higher prices, increasing DAO revenue.</p>\n<p>The express lane controller should rationally allow anyone willing to pay access to the express lane, creating a market for priority access on demand. Chaos Labs does not view secondary markets as a negative outcome, but acknowledges that much remains unknown around how they could unfold.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-competition-in-the-express-lane-auction-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-competition-in-the-express-lane-auction-6\"></a>Competition in the Express Lane Auction</h2>\n<p>Independent competition is crucial for auctions to clear at efficient prices. The innovative and novel Timeboost ordering has no precedent currently and we therefore consider a range of potential market development outcomes for the express lane.</p>\n<p>There is a risk that a small group of participants could dominate the Timeboost auctions, potentially due to their superior ability to capitalize on MEV or through other advantages. This dominance could lead to reduced competition or even collusion, undermining the fairness and efficiency of the system.</p>\n<p>The dynamic reserve price mechanism acts as a defense against uncompetitive bidding scenarios. It is recommended to monitor the auction winners, their bids, and the MEV harvested over each round to ensure that the express lane does not become too profitable for auction winners.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-introducing-mev-strategies-not-currently-viable-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-introducing-mev-strategies-not-currently-viable-7\"></a>Introducing MEV strategies not currently viable</h2>\n<p>Ordinary transactions will remain private until executed under Timeboost, which typically prevents the express lane owner from front-running user transactions. However, transactions like liquidations and pre-committed orders, such as limit orders, are at risk of being front-run by the express lane auction winner.</p>\n<p>This occurs because the express lane owner has a latency advantage, allowing them to manage and execute these transactions with a higher likelihood of landing in their order of preference. While these same strategies are technically possible under FCFS, the probability of landing them is low enough to discourage them. It is unclear whether this will change under Timeboost to make these strategies more predictable.</p>\n<p>In this case, the owner of the express lane has the opportunity to capture value that is not currently available at the expense of liquidated (or limit order-placing) users and/or protocols. It should be noted that if this is the case then presumably the express lane will become more valuable, increasing DAO revenue.</p>\n<p>Example of potential Timeboost Ordering MEV on liquidation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The express lane owner identifies a liquidatable account on a perpetual futures protocol.</li>\n<li>The express lane operator maximizes their profit by executing a sandwich attack, taking advantage of their 200ms latency edge (or however Timeboost is configured). This predictability allows them to execute the liquidation unopposed and complete the sandwich strategy:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>They first sell a large number of perpetual contracts on the relevant market, driving the price lower by either consuming order book bids or impacting the protocol’s pricing inputs, such as open interest imbalance.</li>\n<li>They then liquidate the account, further pushing the price downward.</li>\n<li>Finally, they close their position by buying back the contracts at the now-lower price.</li>\n<li>As a result, users receive less collateral after the liquidation than they would have if the sandwich attack hadn’t occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Comparison with Current First-Come, First-Serve Transaction Flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An account becomes eligible for liquidation.</li>\n<li>Liquidators compete by spamming the network to execute the liquidation and claim the liquidation bonus.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Due to the competitive nature of liquidation rights, liquidators cannot easily predict or front-run transactions.</li>\n<li>While this results in network spamming, the liquidations remain efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Careful monitoring of express lane transactions should be sufficient at this stage as it is unclear whether Timeboost provides sufficient advantage to the express lane controller to execute harmful strategies. Keeping the NonExpressDelayMsec parameter shorter than block times could also be a useful mitigant in this regard.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-58637-friction-to-the-adoption-of-limit-order-books-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-friction-to-the-adoption-of-limit-order-books-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-8\"></a>Friction to the adoption of limit order books on Arbitrum Orbit Chains</h2>\n<p>Introducing a 200ms latency could render fully on-chain limit order books impractical in the future from a market maker UX perspective. Market makers rely on low latency to cancel orders promptly, and the delay would increase the potential for by the express lane controller to trade on their stale prices before they are able to cancel them, putting market makers at a significant disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Considering the predominant DEX designs currently this is unlikely to be an issue on Arbitrum One or Nova, but application-specific Orbit Chains considering this might need to consider how this risk.</p>\n<p>Market making on limit order books</p>\n<p>On limit order book exchanges, there are typically an order of magnitude more cancelled orders than matched trades. The<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about/marketstructuredata-decile-quartile\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> SEC reports</a> that there are 14 cancelled orders for every matched trade in US stock markets. The reasons for this phenomenon are explored in more detail<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fire.12363\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> here</a> and are found to be primarily driven by adverse selection risks.</p>\n<p>Under Timeboost, when an arbitrageur controls the express lane, as we expect it to be much of the time, market makers are disadvantaged in the latency they experience relative to the arbitrageur. As a result, their stale prices would be vulnerable to arbitrage before they have the opportunity to cancel or update their orders.</p>\n<p>This can be tangibly explained with the following example. Imagine market maker XYZ in the ETH market submits a bid at 2499 and an ask at 2501, in line with the best bid and ask on CEXs. Then imagine the external price on these CEXs quickly changes to 2504 bid, 2506 ask. The arbitrageur will, with certainty, buy from XYZ on Arbitrum and sell on a CEX, putting XYZ into a short position off-market.</p>\n<p>While this risk exists with the current first-come-first-serve transaction ordering, arbitrageurs do not receive favorable treatment. Instead, the arbitrageurs will likely spam the network to compete against each other and the price-maker for the arbitrage opportunity. Under Timeboost, arbitrage is more likely, and market makers will have no option other than to widen their spreads as a result.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58637-conclusions-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58637-conclusions-9\"></a>Conclusions</h1>\n<p>While the ultimate impact of the Timeboost upgrade on the microstructure of time-sensitive transactions on Arbitrum is impossible to completely predict ahead of time, Chaos Labs finds the economic risks acceptable.</p>\n<p>We recommend closely monitoring the time sensitivities in and out of the express lane to ensure sufficient competition remains to mitigate abuse of the privilege in hard-to-predict ways. We also recommend monitoring to ensure that it does not lead to the enablement of cross-domain MEV, which could begin to harm users.</p>\n<p>Chaos Labs has performed an economic risk audit of the Timeboost upgrade and finds no material blockers to implementation.

All expenditures will follow The Arbitrum Foundation’s well-established practices and evaluation criteria when pursuing partnership deals, as detailed in a high level manner <a href=\"https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Milestones-Guidance-85e628abdb0640f1a3c280fb26e19934\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Submission-Guidelines-5250083006c942d1a371ef0a85cd1b24\">here</a> (these guidelines apply mainly for the Foundation Grant Program, however, it offers insight into what the Foundation looks at when giving strategic grants or establishing strategic partnerships). Should the proposal be approved by the ArbitrumDAO, the Foundation will update its upcoming annual transparency report due in Q1 2025 to include and detail this additional budget.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58573-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58573-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>In line with its mission as laid out in its <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/The%20Arbitrum%20Foundation%20Bylaws%2020%20July%202023-d992cde49b3207e89bdec76322e29048.pdf\">bylaws</a>, The Arbitrum Foundation is committed to fostering ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. All agreements are designed to support projects that can grow the Arbitrum ecosystem and provide value to the ArbitrumDAO. By seeking projects that advance or contribute to the adoption of Arbitrum technology, the Foundation aims to grow activity on the Arbitrum networks.</p>\n<p>Agreements typically last for a few years with the intention to align a project’s interests with the long-term objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This results in significant capital locked in commitments and reserved for projects based on the agreed performance milestones. This restricts the Foundation’s ability to pursue new partnerships and stay ahead of the competition. Given the aggregate size of Foundation’s current budget, it is difficult for us to pursue multiple large deals simultaneously.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58573-challenges-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58573-challenges-3\"></a>Challenges</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum Foundation runs two funding programs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program</li>\n<li>Strategic Partnership’s Program</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both programs invite applicants from the ecosystem while actively pursuing new opportunities by participating in competitive bids to prospective partners. In both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation signs milestone-based agreements with the recipient that are often multi-year contractual commitments. To date, agreements for our strategic partnerships program typically exceed 2M ARB with an average duration of 2.1 years.</p>\n<p><em>Table: Capital Commitments to Grants, Strategic Partnerships and Infrastructure Service Providers (as of June 30, 2024)</em></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th><em>Jan 1 - Jun 30 2024</em></th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Future Capital Commitments</strong></th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"></th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"></th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Spend<sub><sup>1</sup></sub></strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Signed Agreements<sub><sup>2</sup></sub></strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Pre-agreement Offer</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>USD</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>ARB</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>USD</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>ARB</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>USD</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DeFi &amp; Fintech</td>\n<td>$4,211,916</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3,277,700</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$8,785,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1,842,500</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$89,000,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gaming</td>\n<td>$6,691,353</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">9,579,703</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$1,200,500</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6,510,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$13,900,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Infra Service Providers</td>\n<td>$28,181,124</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">42,941,326</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$8,372,988</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$5,585,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NFT</td>\n<td>$1,265,825</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">377,900</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$1,300,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">10,017,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other <sub><sup>3</sup></sub></td>\n<td>$3,576,582</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1,235,343</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$2,054,525</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">240,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$43,926,800</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">57,411,972</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$21,713,013</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">18,609,500</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">$108,485,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><em><sub><sup>1 Actual spend in the first half of 2024 including payments made in ARB converted to USD using the ARB spot price at the time of payment</sup></sub></em><br>\n<em><sub><sup>2 Numbers include both confidential and non-confidential grants.

Based on the stage of commitment, we can classify all existing deals into two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Signed agreements.</strong> The Arbitrum Foundation and the grant recipient or service provider have entered into an agreement. Most grant recipients will be entitled to grant payouts as milestones and/or other criteria are reached. The amounts in the table reflect the value of future financial obligations related to signed agreements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pre-agreement offer.</strong> An agreement has not yet been reached but is in negotiation. The Foundation has reserved funds to ensure we can act upon the commitment when an agreement is reached. The amounts in the table reflect the full value of the agreement.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation must have adequate reserves immediately available before it can make an offer to a potential partner. Given the competitive landscape, The Arbitrum Foundation must be able to make multiple offers to different partners at the same time. Also, the Foundation must be prepared for all offers to be accepted and reserve amounts accordingly even if negotiations fail at a later stage.</p>\n<p>With the above in mind, The Arbitrum Foundation is at a distinct disadvantage from extending competitive offers to strategic partners due to the size of our overall allocation from the DAO. The three major financial challenges currently facing The Arbitrum Foundation from extending continued support to ecosystem expansion are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tight budget.</strong> Relative to competitors, the budget that the Foundation can allocate for strategic partnerships is small and puts the Arbitrum ecosystem at a significant disadvantage. For example, if we consider allocations relative to token supply, Starknet has allocated ~20% to its Foundation and grants, Optimism has 25% for ecosystem funding, ZkSync has 19.9% for ecosystem initiatives, while The Arbitrum Foundation has 7.5% allocated, but to date, The Arbitrum Foundation has only had access to approximately 1.8% because of the vesting contract. Making competitive offers requires a lot of capital that we have not been allocated relative to other Foundations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Vesting.</strong> The Foundation can only make offers based on the ARB that has vested to date. This is because the ArbitrumDAO can clawback the funds at any time and we must have the ARB available to pay milestones. The Foundation is committed to being solvent at all times, so our assets should always exceed our contractual liabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Capital lockup.</strong> All committed ARB in a milestone-based agreement must be allocated until the agreement terminates. For example, we could run into a situation where a grantee has not yet hit their milestones, but we need to assume they will and hold the potential payout in reserve. Additionally, some agreements require capital lockup (like RWAs), in projects where the funds belong to the Arbitrum Foundation, but they are utilized by the strategic partner’s protocol.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, The Arbitrum Foundation does not yet have access to its full budget which has caused issues over the past year, but even if the vesting was complete, our budget still remains the smallest amongst all rollups. This impacts all programs run by The Arbitrum Foundation including strategic partnerships, technical advancement, educational and community activities.</p>\n<p>We believe the most straightforward approach to ensuring The Arbitrum Foundation can pursue competitive deals is by increasing our budget for strategic partnerships.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-58573-proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#p-58573-proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution</h1>\n<p><strong>Funding Request:</strong> 250 million ARB</p>\n<p>In light of the above mentioned challenges, we believe that there are several reasons why increasing our budget to specifically better support strategic partnerships is essential:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>High costs of pursuing partnerships.</strong> Strategic partnerships are essential for the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth, and these partnerships often come with significant capital investments from the Foundation. For example, onboarding RWAs is both challenging and capital-intensive, as experienced by the DAO as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expanding Orbit Chains.</strong> Despite more than 50 chains publicly announcing their intent to build using Orbit since the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program in January 2024, the rollup as a tech stack ecosystem is still in its early stages. Additional funding is required to enable The Arbitrum Foundation to pursue major Orbit partnerships and allow the Arbitrum ecosystem to access new markets, use cases and communities. Additionally we should note that sometimes part Orbit chain grants could be rebates on the revenue that they contribute to the Arbitrum DAO, creating a mismatch between the Arbitrum Foundation allocating resources and the DAO collecting chain fees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gateway to DAO.</strong> The DAO has previously contributed to onboarding partners via programs like STEP, however, the experience has been that most institutions are not inclined toward engaging and participating in public forums, and even when they do it is after extensive conversations with The Arbitrum Foundation and its service providers, who are making them aware of the opportunities and encouraging them to get involved. As front line enablers, The Arbitrum Foundation actively builds relationships with partners and encourages all partners to engage with the DAO. Most recent examples include Securitize (via BlackRock BUIDL) and Franklin Templeton.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proven track record.</strong> The Foundation has a proven track record of managing and allocating funds effectively for various initiatives, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/ArbitrumFoundationBiannualReport2024H1-c8e9ab997fe68ad09c0105181f9826d8.pdf\">2024 Biannual Progress Report</a> and successful collaborations with industry leading projects. Additionally, The Arbitrum Foundation has capitalized on emerging opportunities such as LRTs, RWAs and onchain gaming, ensuring the Arbitrum ecosystem remains competitive and innovative.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also believe the current vesting schedule for our entire budget is still critical to remain as is for setting expectations for the Arbitrum Foundation and holding us accountable for how we execute our mission statements. This sets a good example that all programs approved by the DAO must remain accountable and should not assume they can receive all their funding immediately.</p>\n<p>With the above in mind, we are requesting 250 million ARB from the Arbitrum DAO. The amount will solely focus on agreements fulfilling the following 3 criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Key opportunities exceeding 2 million ARB</li>\n<li>New agreements signed after approval of this proposal</li>\n<li>Contractual commitments lasting 1 year or longer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some foreseeable capital-intensive areas include, but are not limited to, expanding the Orbit Chain ecosystem, securing new RWA opportunities, and onboarding well-known TradeFi institutions on Arbitrum. Tokens will only be allocated on an as needed-basis and will only be exchanged as contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.</p>\n<p>The Foundation plans to expand on the special strategic partnership allocation in our future Transparency Reports. Our goal is to enhance visibility into how these collaborations are structured and how resources are allocated, giving the DAO a clearer understanding of the impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. At the same time, we remain committed to respecting any confidentiality provisions stipulated in such agreements. By balancing transparency with confidentiality, the Foundation aims to balance both the sensitivity of onboarding traditional institutions to Arbitrum and also providing updates to the DAO on how the funds are being spent.</p>\n<p>Our goal with this proposal is not to maintain the status quo, it’s to ensure that we can continue to foster ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. The funds will not be used for Arbitrum Foundation operating expenses, including marketing, operations, service providers, or existing signed agreements.</p>\n            <p><small>44 posts - 25 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-funds-to-bolster-foundation-s-strategic-partnerships-budget/26775\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-funds-to-bolster-foundation-s-strategic-partnerships-budget/26775","pubDate":"Thu, 12 Sep 2024 15:32:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-26775"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-funds-to-bolster-foundation-s-strategic-partnerships-budget/26775.rss","#text":"[Non-Constitutional] Funds to Bolster Foundation’s Strategic Partnerships Budget"},"filter":false},{"title":"WINR Protocol STIP.B Bi-Weekly Updates 12.09.2024","dc:creator":"WINRProtocol","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<p><strong>Recap of the Previous Week</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ARB Received Last Disbursement:</strong> 45.000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks:</strong> 45.000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:</strong></p>\n<p>Reward Conditional Main: 0xd525BaE6de08D1f65BE9CB4C09b8b6AD91ecCADD<br>\nClaimer: 0x860dec012b577C7fF62b6899581581CB4089AAf7<br>\nLotteryClaimer: 0x8d8Dd780dFa7413ac33aFc79053e4b6ad0c689dc</p>\n<p><strong>Contract address label Form 62 completed for all addresses:</strong>  Yes</p>\n<p><strong>ARB left over:</strong> 165.000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for leftover ARB:</strong> The program will proceed as scheduled.
