Centrifuge has since been developing the ecosystem and demand for RWAs on Arbitrum, starting with a webinar with Offchain Labs co-founder Steven Goldfeder in November sharing the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/events/7125924551783297024/comments/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vision for bringing RWAs to Arbitrum</a>. Centrifuge is fully operational on Arbitrum and ready to accept investments from day one. Centrifuge is multi-chain by design, all of the liquidity and TVL will stay on Arbitrum.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"decentralization-is-our-dna-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#decentralization-is-our-dna-7\"></a>Decentralization Is Our DNA</h4>\n<p>Centrifuge itself is a fully decentralized DAO, and comes with an active ecosystem and contributors. A partnership in this capacity would further the network effects of our relationship by connecting both ecosystems. The Centrifuge ecosystem consists of issuers and liquidity providers, which the Arbitrum ecosystem can onboard at any time.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"tvl-on-the-most-trusted-rwa-protocol-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tvl-on-the-most-trusted-rwa-protocol-8\"></a>TVL On The Most Trusted RWA Protocol</h4>\n<p>An investment through Centrifuge’s platform will bolster RWAs on Arbitrum by bootstrapping network liquidity for one of the largest RWA protocols onchain. The Stable Treasury Endowment Program was set up not only to improve treasury health, but to strengthen projects built on Arbitrum. Using Centrifuge will grow RWA TVL on the Arbitrum network on the most well-recognized RWA protocol. Bootstrapping liquidity on Arbitrum would also further the case for building DeFi primitives composable with our permissioned tokens on the Arbitrum network itself.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"start-with-treasury-bills-expand-beyond-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#start-with-treasury-bills-expand-beyond-9\"></a>Start With Treasury Bills, Expand Beyond</h4>\n<p>Centrifuge is asset agnostic, meaning we do, and will continue to support diversified, high-quality RWA credit asset managers and issuers. As Arbitrum develops beyond phase-1 in the STEP program, Centrifuge will be able to play a key role as a one-stop solution for onchain credit. By onboarding Centrifuge, the path to other assets becomes a more seamless journey.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"introducing-anemoy-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introducing-anemoy-10\"></a>Introducing Anemoy</h4>\n<p>Anemoy is a web3 native asset manager built on Centrifuge. The Anemoy <a href=\"https://www.anemoy.io/funds/ltf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Liquid Treasury Fund</a> (LTF) is a regulated, fully onchain actively managed fund for direct access to &lt;6 month US Treasury Yield. The fund is approved and regulated by the BVI Financial Services Commission (BVI FSC). The fund <a href=\"https://app.centrifuge.io/pools/4139607887\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">TVL is $9.7M</a> and has committed allocations of an additional $10M from GnosisDAO and $20M from Frax.</p>\n<p>Centrifuge proposes that the The Stable Treasury Endowment Program starts with an allocation to Treasury bills through Anemoy. Anemoy is waiving all management fees (15bps annually) on the Arbitrum Network starting from when the Arbitrum Foundation subscribes to the fund, ending May 1st, 2025. This is a move to not only attract the Foundation, but also incentivize other players on the network as a whole. Additionally, all third-party service provider fees are waived until the AUM reaches 50M USDC (currently 9.7M USDC). This brings fees to zero initially, and very low thereafter.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><a name=\"identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#identify-key-management-personnel-and-individual-experience-also-include-third-parties-utilized-for-managing-assets-and-their-qualifications-11\"></a>Identify key management personnel and individual experience.

Some relevant partners to Arbitrum include MakerDAO, BlockTower, Aave, Frax, and GnosisDAO. Centrifuge is happy to facilitate introductions between organizations as requested. Brief descriptions of our work below:</p>\n<p>MakerDAO:</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2022 we proposed alongside institutional lender, BlockTower, to launch a $220M securitization pool on Centrifuge. The underlying assets were made up of senior loan positions in invoice financing, trade finance, or other short term receivables. Today, BlockTower pools on Centrifuge have around $190M in assets. The BlockTower arrangement was the first time a credit fund’s operations had been brought onchain, requiring immense legal and operational work to bring to fruition. Much of our DAO protocol work since has taken learnings and structures from this arrangement to implement elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Centrifuge began working closely with MakerDAO in 2020 when our first real estate credit pool was <a href=\"https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ns-drop-mip6-application-new-silver-drop-real-estate-backed-loans/3477\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">proposed</a> with New Silver. Since then, New Silver has launched another pool with MakerDAO titled New Silver II, where they got a debt ceiling increase from $20M to $50M.</p>\n<p>Aave:</p>\n<p>The Centrifuge RWA Market on Aave was launched in 2021 marking the first institutional grade RWA lending market. This allowed users to deposit stablecoins in return for senior or junior tranches of credit directly within the Aave application. The Aave DAO recently has approved to onboard the Aave Treasury into Centrifuge Prime, to allocate an investment into the Anemoy US Treasury Bill fund.</p>\n<p>Celo:</p>\n<p>Celo is another network using Anemoy on the Centrifuge platform to better their long-term sustainability for their treasury. They invest in Anemoy’s LTF and have intentions to diversify into other assets including Flow Carbon’s offset pool. Centrifuge is live on Celo through Liquidity Pools, marking the first use case of our multi-chain product. TVL remains on the Celo network, akin to this proposal with Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>GnosisDAO:</p>\n<p>Some of our newest clients include GnosisDAO, who decided to allocate a portion of their treasury to Centrifuge Prime, mainly the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund. The <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0xa779ccda18ee2aeb56894e8b5baafd3d2568e99b0fea4a03dd246f548084a93c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GnosisDAO proposal</a> includes $10M being allocated. Karpatkey is the financial service provider for GnosisDAO who is now managing the day to day operations of all investments including in RWAs.</p>\n<p>Frax:</p>\n<p>Frax is another DAO that recently decided to onboard the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund. The Frax treasury will be bringing $20M to RWAs as outlined in this <a href=\"https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-308-onboard-frax-to-centrifuge-prime/2775\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">recent proposal</a>. This is a strong step in the direction of working towards long term sustainability of the DAO in light of ongoing liabilities and ecosystem development.</p>\n<p>Web3 Foundation:</p>\n<p>The Web3 Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that supports Web3 teams and open-source projects through funding, advocacy, research and collaboration, recently <a href=\"https://centrifuge.mirror.xyz/RPd-sjMJLK9W2UYknAM09EJwguxHJci-dbc2msd27MU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">announced their investment</a> with Anemoy on the Centrifuge platform.

A tracking error in this context is the divergence between the price behavior of the LTF tokens, and the underlying prices of portfolio assets. This is not applicable for LTF tokens as the relationship between NAV and token price is identical. LTF tokens do not trade on the secondary market, meaning the only prices come from primary issuance and redemption.

See our recent proposal <a href=\"https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/rfc-launch-an-rwa-lending-market/6346\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">on Centrifuge’s forum</a>. Centrifuge is setting up use cases to allow investors to 1) pledge RWA tokens as collateral to borrow at high LTVs, and 2) gain instant redemptions as lenders are able to buy the short-term liability when users request to redeem shares.

The fund invests in ongoing rolling maturities, meaning as one Bill expires, the fund aims to buy a bill with a maturity six-months out. This ensures a diversified mix of Bills between 0-6 months. US T-Bills are held directly by the fund with our custodian, Pershing LLC, and AUM can be viewed onchain.

The T-Bill investment carries essentially no investment risk and duration risk. Operational risk is minimized due to a highly simplified and streamlined process. Legal and regulatory risk is minimal as the fund is fully licensed under BVI law. The BVI Financial Services Commission is one of the world’s only regulators actively allowing and regulating funds such as the one being proposed. This allows Anemoy to not provide services in the gray areas of the law.</p>\n<p>Trident Trust oversees meticulous KYC/KYB/AML protocols.

However, the system faced hurdles, particularly regarding the availability of ARB from vesting contracts. Rapid issuance of oARB tokens initially yielded high returns for early depositors, but challenges arose towards the end of the period. As more depositors opted for the non-ETH investment 40-week option, we encountered delays due to the need to taper emissions.</li>\n<li>This experience highlighted the importance of closely monitoring token availability and adjusting emissions to ensure a sustainable and consistent user experience. Additionally, while the requirement for increased ETH and ARB investment faced backlash from farmers accustomed to direct emissions, it was a critical aspect contributing to the success of our strategy. Mandating a vesting ARB and ETH investment commitment helped reduce the number of users taking advantage of the high emissions rate, allowing savvy users to achieve increased yield in a shorter timeframe.</li>\n<li>Overall, this experience provided valuable insights for future iterations that protect the ARB community, emphasizing the need for flexibility and adaptability in incentive programs.</li>\n<li>Going forward we will target a direct incentive approach with dynamic incentives based on where TVL is needed within our vault system.</li>\n<li>Without an oARB system and running two different types of emission schedules we can create a streamlined dune dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>375,000 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved decision making</strong> - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Retaining top performers</strong> - Some ideas and teams won’t produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher self awareness &amp; accountability</strong> - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowers individual contributors</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.</li>\n<li><strong>Removed intermediaries</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone’s compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible information usage</strong> - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source contribution data</strong> - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Self sovereign identity adoption</strong> - Individual contribution logs can be tied to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust based networks</strong> - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they’ve built and the common connections they share.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Read our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution verification and contribution logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/approaches/contribution-verification-approaches\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification approaches</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Experimentation in Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>Individual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants process or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to start building up their own reputation. Idea funding and contributor funding could both experiment with individual contribution logs.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Further investigation</strong></p>\n<p>These is an opportunity to create more tooling that could enable individual contributors to easily record and present their contribution efforts. Contribution logs could become increasingly useful and reliable for contributors to build their reputation in the ecosystem and for voters when making funding decisions.</p>\n<p>In the comings months the Web3 Association is going to look at what tooling already exists that could be used and then explore what new tools could be created to make it easier to record and present contribution efforts.

It’s crucial to highlight that the impact of our STIP is not about ephemeral incentives. Instead, we are strategically deploying funds directly into DAO treasuries to foster long-term, sustainable TVL on the Arbitrum network. Our approach is not centered on short-term fluctuations; rather, we’re committed to enhancing the long-term stability and scalability of TVL on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>We aim to cultivate a sticky and lasting TVL within these DAO treasuries on Arbitrum, focusing on the strategic growth of the ecosystem. This will be achieved by strengthening the financial health and governance capabilities of the DAOs involved, as evidenced by monitored metrics such as TVL growth and participatory governance activities incentivized by Tally. We are excited to track these metrics over time</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, we are in close communication with STIP recipients Open Dollar and Pixel Vault, who are expected to augment their DAO treasuries with substantial TVL contributions shortly. We are currently gathering feedback regarding the timelines and specifics of these deployments, which we will include in our final STIP Bridge proposal. Thus far, here are some metrics on the 3 DAO recipients of our STIP: Open Dollar, Content Guild, and Pixel Vault:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TVL in DAOs on Arbitrum incentivized by Tally</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>10/23</th>\n<th>11/23</th>\n<th>12/23</th>\n<th>1/24</th>\n<th>2/24</th>\n<th>3/24</th>\n<th>4/24</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/opendollar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open Dollar</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>41.7k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/content-guild\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Content Guild</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>16.4k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xa1885BFfE760bcCa872D3C34c976Eb0350e3590c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pixel Vault</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>75k (still awaiting our STIP distribution via bridge to Arbitrum Nova)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ul>\n<li>Votes in DAOs on Arbitrum incentivized by Tally</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>10/23</th>\n<th>11/23</th>\n<th>12/23</th>\n<th>1/24</th>\n<th>2/24</th>\n<th>3/24</th>\n<th>4/24</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/opendollar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Open Dollar</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/content-guild\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Content Guild</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xa1885BFfE760bcCa872D3C34c976Eb0350e3590c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Pixel Vault</a></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><ol start=\"5\">\n<li>[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?<br>\nThere are a lot of moving parts in launching a DAO. We learned quite a bit about managing time and expectations better for DAO launches, with prime example being GMX, which we expected to launch during the STIP period and was unable to (this is one of the reasons we want to apply for STIP bridge, to deploy to them). It turns out we needed more time than we thought to get each DAO up and running, which taught us to plan for the unexpected and maybe pad our timelines a bit. We also saw how crucial it is to dive deep with each DAO, ensuring their contracts are spot-on and everything’s functional from the start.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?<br>\n200,000 ARB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

To to mitigate this to a certain extent, we shipped an “airdrop points shraing” system - as a part of which, lenders earn 50% of the points from EigenLayer points/ LRT points.

The token grabs the place of asset information, where it is securely stored in the server named token vault. Token Vault is the only place where the original information can be linked to its corresponding token thus protecting the sensitive information. Creating tokenized assets includes defining the token type, choosing the blockchain to issue the token, a third party to verify, and more. In Asset Tokenization Platform Development, assets can also be divided and stored in blockchain ensuring security, transparency, and immutability which helps the investors to buy a part of the asses without buying them outright. This process can democratize access to an asset, reduce transaction costs, and increase the liquidity in the market.<br>\nVisit&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://maticz.com/asset-tokenization-platform-development\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Asset Tokenization Platform Development Company</a><br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/l6ussYKDLbueaeeY9ubEq1EFttj.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Asset Tokenization Platform development\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_690x388.jpeg\" alt=\"Asset Tokenization Platform development\" data-base62-sha1=\"l6ussYKDLbueaeeY9ubEq1EFttj\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/93e97ff25486f0fe370d00b0f38d9eff6cdb7025_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"5A626F\"></a></div><p></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-does-asset-tokenization-work/23461\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-does-asset-tokenization-work/23461","pubDate":"Sat, 27 Apr 2024 05:30:31 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23461"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-does-asset-tokenization-work/23461.rss","#text":"How Does Asset Tokenization Work?"},"filter":false},{"title":"Frax Finance STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"Frax.Finance","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h4><a name=\"information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\"></a>Information about STIP/STIP Backfund</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Can you provide a link to your previous STIP proposal (round 1 or backfund)? <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-final-stip-round-1/16579\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[Frax Finance] [FINAL] [STIP - Round 1]</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How much, in the previous STIP proposal, did you request in ARB? 1,500,000 ARB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What date did you start the incentive program and what date did it end?

Leveraging strategic partnerships and innovative strategies, we successfully increased our TVL by nearly threefold, surpassing the 50 million mark. The graph below illustrates this remarkable growth trajectory over the course of the program, showcasing the steady rise in TVL and highlighting our commitment to fostering a robust DeFi environment on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4e4da1250841ceafe23184ddff4e9152c106dd94.jpeg\" alt=\"Graph 1: TVL Growth Over Time\" data-base62-sha1=\"baHyUrpnWemBNB34aLkoWeMewEk\" width=\"624\" height=\"245\"></p>\n<p>This substantial growth in TVL not only demonstrates the growing confidence and participation of users within our ecosystem but also reflects the effectiveness of our liquidity strategies and engagement initiatives. By attracting more assets and liquidity into Arbitrum, we have contributed to the network’s overall vibrancy and liquidity depth.</p>\n<p>Moreover, our collaborative efforts with approximately 30 different protocols played a crucial role in creating, bootstrapping, and nurturing liquidity pools, thereby enhancing the economic value within Arbitrum. This collaborative approach fostered a thriving ecosystem and contributed to the overall growth and development of DeFi on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we initiated Fraxlend on Arbitrum, providing users with advanced lending and borrowing capabilities and further enriching the decentralized finance landscape on the Arbitrum network. These achievements underscore our ongoing dedication to innovation, collaboration, and sustainable growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>[Optional] Any lessons learned from the previous STIP round?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We gained insights into the diverse demand for various products from the previous round and identified optimal strategies for maximizing incentive efficiency. Additionally, we recognized the effectiveness of user education in showcasing new opportunities and enhancing participation within the ecosystem. These lessons learned have contributed significantly to refining our approach and ensuring targeted and impactful allocation of resources in the extended STIP grants.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal? 750,000 ARB</li>\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same way* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?<br>\nWe plan to maintain a similar approach with some adjustments to our economic strategies.</li>\n<li>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in term of mechanisms and products?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We plan to maintain a similar approach to incentive distribution as outlined in Section 3 of the STIP proposal. However, we intend to make some adjustments to our economic strategies. These adjustments include increasing protocol lending directly in Arbitrum, enhancing incentives for our yield-bearing assets, and introducing incentives for borrowers with yield-bearing collaterals. These changes aim to optimize our incentive structure and better align with the evolving dynamics of the ecosystem.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?<br>\nThe address will be:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisig to receive the incentives: 0xe61D9ed1e5Dc261D1e90a99304fADCef2c76FD10</li>\n<li>Contracts that will distribute the incentives:\n<ul>\n<li>FRAX Incentivizer AMO Address (All of FRAX pools are being incentivized through this contract): 0xefa5D36deBF5191328b17f2Ff74090DAdfda9A70</li>\n<li>frxETH Incentivizer AMO Address (All of frxETH pools are being incentivized through this contract): 0x3C6d74267b01E00B2C8F541ff132A7b03bcC6c70</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The multisig used to receive the incentives and contracts for distribution of incentives will be the same.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Could you share any feedback or suggestion on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In reflecting on our experience with the previous incentive programs, we’ve identified a few areas for improvement and future considerations. One key suggestion is to incorporate target-based incentives into the program. This addition would ensure that scalability is accompanied by sustainability, providing clear goals and milestones for participants to strive towards.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, implementing a protocol matching system for coincentivization could significantly enhance the program. Our experience in the first month highlighted the time-consuming process of finding suitable allies in Arbitrum. With a matching system, we could identify more win-win opportunities and accelerate the collaboration process, ultimately maximizing the impact and success of the incentive program.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-stip-addendum/23459\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-stip-addendum/23459","pubDate":"Sat, 27 Apr 2024 04:41:06 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23459"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/frax-finance-stip-addendum/23459.rss","#text":"Frax Finance STIP Addendum"},"filter":false},{"title":"Vela Exchange STIP Addendum","dc:creator":"Djinn","category":"STIP Bridge Addendum","description":"<h4><a name=\"information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#information-about-stipstip-backfund-1\"></a>Information about STIP/STIP Backfund</h4>\n<p><strong>1.

How will this investment improve Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>The driving idea behind the Arbitrum STEP is to support the growing RWA ecosystem and diversify the Arbitrum treasury into tokenized RWAs that offer stable, liquid and uncorrelated yield. For this, Dinari is offering two possible investments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>USFR.d, a token based on the WisdomTree Floating Rate ETF (ticker USFR), a fund that invests in U.S. Floating Rate Notes. Even among the various available Dinari dShares, USFR.d offers a unique investment avenue that was purpose-built with price stability, liquidity and yield in mind.</li>\n<li>SPY.d, a token based on the SPDR S&amp;P500 ETF (ticker SPY), a fund that invests in S&amp;P 500 companies and tracks the S&amp;P500 index.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dinari dShares are a new type of decentralized security bringing tokenized access to the US stock market to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The public stock markets are perhaps the largest traditional RWA category in the world representing $50T USD of value in the US alone and over $110T USD globally. While these markets are large and efficient, traditional access to them, especially outside of the US, is still challenging.</p>\n<p>It is Dinari’s overarching goal to democratize access to the traditional stock market and bring these assets on-chain. Dinari issues 1:1 backed security tokens (“dShares”) in the form of a standard, transferable and yield-bearing ERC-20s. dShares are guaranteed to be 100%-backed at all times with our fully-automated and audited mint and burn process.</p>\n<p>Dinari has been an SEC-registered transfer agent since 2022 and issues dShares under SEC Regulation S to investors that undergo KYB/KYC.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum’s RWA ecosystem is small but fast growing and Dinari is proud and excited to be a part of it.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

He stepped back as CEO in 2021 as the company was preparing to IPO. He has been contemplating the ways in which we can globalize the stock exchange through the blockchain since 2016, working to formulate the idea with Balaji Srinivasan who was a friend building a biotech company next door to Freenome at the time. The establishment of the first version of RWAs (mainly stablecoins) and their high market cap makes Gabriel believe that this is finally the time that a global RWA exchange will take off. His previous dealings with regulators has proven valuable navigating the difficult regulatory challenges of Dinari. Gabriel holds a BA in Computational Biology and Chemistry from Cornell University and attended University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine for graduate studies before withdrawing to start Freenome.</p>\n<p><strong>Jake Timothy (CTO)</strong>: Jake began his career at Northrop Grumman’s aerospace division, where he led the development of sophisticated data-driven systems.

Our users and investors should consult their tax advisors for any tax considerations.</p>\n<p><strong>Dividends</strong></p>\n<p>Yield for all underlying stock are distributed as dividends which are then subsequently distributed by Dinari to token holders in one of two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Holders of dShares like USFR.d and SPY.d are issued dividends in the form of USDC to the holding wallet.</li>\n<li>Holders of wrapped dShares like USFR.dw and SPY.dw are issued dividends in the form of reinvestment in the dShare which are reified upon unwrapping.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: Wrapping of dShares from their SYMB.d to SYMB.dw is necessary for compatibility and composability with DeFi. Wrapped dShares are able to account for changes to the underlying stock such as stock splits/reverse splits and continue to provide yield even when staked or otherwise used in DeFi protocols. You are able to wrap and unwrap dShares at <a href=\"http://sbt.dinari.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sbt.dinari.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>USFR.d</strong><br>\nThe USFR.d token issuance and redemption price is determined by the underlying USFR ETF price on the stock market. This price is typically very stable at approximately $50 USD per share with very minor fluctuations loosely based on dividend timing. We anticipate that holders of USFR.d will primarily see dividend-based tax implications.</p>\n<p><strong>SPY.d</strong><br>\nThe SPY.d token issuance and redemption price is also determined by the underlying SPY ETF price on the stock market. The price tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index and can vary over time. Because it is an index composed of many companies from varied industries, the price tends to be more stable than other stocks or ETFs. SPY is the oldest and most liquid ETF in the world and is considered a stable growth ETF in many portfolios. We anticipate that holders of SPY.d will primarily see dividend and capital gains/losses tax implications.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Describe the process and expected timeline for liquidation of assets, if given instructions to do so by Arbitrum governance.</strong></p>\n<p>The issuance and redemption of dShare tokens is a fully-automated process. Redemption requests are made by sending dShare tokens to the Dinari order contract.</p>\n<p>If the US stock market is open, redemption requests will typically take seconds. If the US stock market is closed, redemption requests are queued and executed upon market open. Large redemption requests that exceed Dinari real-time operational liquidity will still be executed in seconds but the return of USDC funds may take up to T+2 business days (typically same-day if before wire cutoff). This is primarily due to the slowness of moving fiat USD through the traditional finance system.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What amount of first-loss equity will Sponsor provide to ensure over-collateralization, how is the first-loss equity denominated, and what is the source of capital?</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari plans to comply with and exceed at all times the minimum net capital rule outlined by SEC Rule 15c3-1 for broker-dealers. Namely, Dinari will hold funds that exceed the greater of $250,000 or 6-2/3 percent of its aggregate indebtedness (basic method); or, Dinari will hold funds that exceed the greater of $250,000 or 2 percent of customer-related receivables (alternative method). In practice, the amount allocated for first-loss equity has far exceeded the minimum requirements set forth by SEC Rule 15c3-1 to date. First-loss equity would first be denominated by the equity holdings in the underlying position; any excess would be sourced by Dinari equity capital, as appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Describe the liquidity and stability of the proposed underlying assets, including anticipated settlement times from the sale of the underlying to the repayment of ARB.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>USFR.d</strong><br>\nThe underlying assets (USFR stock) is very stable with typical daily pricing aberrations of less than 0.02% and has an average daily trading volume of $190M. Typical transaction times for USFR for issuance or redemption is measured in seconds.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USFR:NYSEARCA?window=MAX\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1aa3393c8b13ba848a07f23aaf571effc78d2250.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"698C74\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USFR:NYSEARCA?window=MAX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Google Finance</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/359;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6396ae75dae0ab0f555434446a9eeee9cdb3c807_2_690x360.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EBEEEC\" width=\"690\" height=\"360\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/USFR:NYSEARCA?window=MAX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund (USFR) Price &amp; News - Google Finance</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Get the latest WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund (USFR) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>The underlying asset of the WisdomTree Floating Rate ETF (“USFR”) itself are U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Notes which are generally regarded as one of the safest investment instruments in the world and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.

If relying on the blockchain for any of the transactional flows, please describe any blockchain derived risks and mitigations.</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari dShare issuance and redemption flows are exclusively based on smart contracts and we rely on the transparency and programmability of the blockchain for all order flows. Blockchain derived risks can be split into a few categories.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Technical - Our smart contracts support a wide variety of assets and order modes and this naturally introduces technical complexity. We believe that we mitigate technical risks with internal code reviews, extensive automated test environments and external code audits.</li>\n<li>Operational - In addition to smart contracts, there are a number of internal processes that interact with our blockchain contracts to execute orders and move funds. To mitigate these risks, we employ Drata, an external consultant, to audit our corporate controls and processes and ensure adherence to AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. We are actively working on SOC 2 Type II compliance.</li>\n<li>Regulatory - The regulatory landscape around the blockchain is still evolving but our goal has always to be transparent and compliant. We have been a registered SEC transfer agent since 2022 and maintain active and direct relationships with both the SEC and FINRA.</li>\n<li>Error/Fraud - In the event of an error or detection of fraudulent activity, the dShare holdings of a wallet may become trade-restricted and/or blacklisted. At Dinari’s discretion and ability to accurately reconcile asset ownership with off-chain processes, dShare tokens are able to be reissued to return rightful ownership.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>7.

Can you explain how is risk management (inv and operational) being done? Can you provide a copy of your risk management policy?</strong></p>\n<p>Dinari manages risk along a number of different dimensions.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Investment:</strong><br>\nDinari issues tokens (dShares) that are backed 1:1 with an underlying equity security or ETF. We mitigate market and liquidity risk by only offering tokenized access whose underlying securities meet certain market capitalization and trading volume thresholds and trade on major stock exchanges, such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. In addition, none of our customers are currently using margin accounts or are able to borrow against their tokens. If we were to plan to offer customers the use of margin accounts in the future, Dinari would subject them to regulatory requirements, such as Federal Reserve Regulation T and FINRA Rule 4210, as well as to the margin requirements of our broker-dealer partner, Alpaca Securities.</p>\n<p>From a portfolio perspective, while the majority of assets under management relate to customer securities and funds held by Alpaca, Dinari does own a small amount of securities itself for the sole purpose of facilitating market-making and liquidity. Dinari actively monitors the amount of Dinari-owned securities to ensure that it does not exceed a certain threshold; historically, this figure has averaged less than two percent of Dinari’s equity capital.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Operational</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Customer: All users must undergo KYB/KYC processes with Dinari’s third-party partners, as well as pass AML/CTF procedures, before gaining approval to use the Dinari platform. Additionally, because Dinari solely controls the mint and burn process of our tokens, Dinari controls the redemption process of those tokens as well. Dinari also has the unilateral ability to restrict customer transaction activity on the Dinari platform should any user be found to be in violation of our policies.</li>\n<li>Internal Controls: Dinari employs Drata, an external consultant, to audit our corporate controls and processes and ensure adherence to AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. We also employ Fordefi, an institutional multi-party computation (MPC) wallet and security solution that is SOC 2 Type II-compliant and centralizes control over and access to our portfolio of crypto wallets.</li>\n<li>IT Security: In addition to internal controls, Dinari operates a centralized Identity and Access Management system using OAuth, SAML and multi-factor authentication to centrally manage access to all internal systems, production/staging environments and even most external systems. Dinari employs Drata to continuously audit and monitor access controls to proactively secure our systems and endpoints.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"performance-reporting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#performance-reporting-5\"></a>Performance reporting</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

This means all of the grant rounds contracts, grant proposals that were created on grants stack are all now on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Also in their 20th quarterly grants program round all of the contributions from donors that and the matching fund payouts from Gitcoin will all take place on Arbitrum!</p>\n<p>This means approximately <strong>50,000 people using Arbitrum</strong> for their donations (many of them first-time community members) and about <strong>5 million onchain transitions</strong> during the round.</p>\n<p>There are over 1.5 million dollars in matching funds for grantees in these rounds and direct donations from community members are often half or more of that total, So we can anticipate over 2 million USD equivalent in transaction volume generated from this program in a little more than 2 weeks.</p>\n<p>We have done our part by allocating funds from the Thank ARB program Milestone 1(b). We are giving 100k to the Open Source Software Rounds and 100k to the Community rounds that were selected by Gitcoin to be part of GG20 and who are running their rounds on ARB.</p>\n<p>But that’s not all!</p>\n<p>To make the most of this momentous occasion we have organized a series of rewards for your contributions in GG20, which kicked off this week on Tuesday the 22nd. Whether you’re a builder, a promoter, a curator, or a program manager, there’s a way for you to get involved, showcase your talents, and earn rewards along the way.</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing experimentation and iteration on funding allocation mechanisms and grant program design (at least 90 assessments done by multiple expert reviewers of projects plus all 8 of the grans rounds supported)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Attracting new builder and new community members (30k-50k users, at least 30 projects assessed as high quality which were made by builders on Arbitrum)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>generating transaction volume (approximately 5 million onchain transactions)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>increasing awareness and adoption of Arbitrum Nova infrastructure. (harder to measure but its a good intention to have)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strategy:</p>\n<p>This process is being “supercharged” by Thrive Protocol which we are using to facilitate these incentives as well as assessments and validation of the projects funded as well as the program themselves.</p>\n<p>The intention of this approach is to create a flywheel effect where one dollar in equals more than 2 dollars out in value (based on the goals stated above). In practical terms that means strategic rewards to incentivize useful activity as well as a mixture of automated and human assessment and human validation. This is the key to scalability and effective iteration/ refinement.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ha3zD7rrngTE3yjwjKDtk2Gjv2G.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Thriving_GG20_flywheel\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a_2_690x387.jpeg\" alt=\"Thriving_GG20_flywheel\" data-base62-sha1=\"ha3zD7rrngTE3yjwjKDtk2Gjv2G\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a_2_690x387.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/78480243ac8a8931cd17d026c822be7d7c12f26a.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"323231\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>For Builders:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Apply for the Thank ARB Builders Bonus: Don’t be shy about your amazing work!

growth and foster sticky liquidity. One example would be support real-yield assets, such as LSD and stablecoins backed by RWA yields. By allocating more incentives to these assets, we aim to ensure that liquidity remains robust and resilient even after the conclusion of the campaign.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-2\"></a><strong>New Plans for STIP Bridge</strong></h3>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>500,000 ARB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

What are the top level objectives and north star metrics our grant funding should drive? Most grant programs won’t directly affect these top level metrics, but how do we know that they are precisely targeting a goal which has leverage on the north star metrics? How do we define success of a grant program in a way that is aligned with the needs of the ecosystem overall?</p>\n<p>On Tuesday the 23rd, Thank ARB hosted a session to align on these goals.</p>\n<p>There are three phases to this project.

In the end, we came up with the following North Star Metrics (which we call Objectives) in no particular order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase Daily Active Users (DAU)</li>\n<li>Increase Total Volume Locked (TVL)</li>\n<li>Increase Net Bridge Inflows</li>\n<li>Increase Number of Verticals Arbtrum Leads in Market Share</li>\n<li>Increase Number of Protocols Actively Building on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Increase Number of People Buying ARB to Use in Governance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then brainstormed and heatmapped support for which levers have the best opportunity to affect these objectives. We called these goals.</p>\n<p>The top suggestions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kickstart new verticals</li>\n<li>Incentivize dapps for retention</li>\n<li>Attract new protocols willing to mint natively with lockups on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Design and implement staking &amp; utility use cases for ARB</li>\n<li>Convince RWAs to launch natively</li>\n<li>Market to institutional investors</li>\n<li>Targeted marketing campaigns to educate about orbit &amp; stylus</li>\n<li>Conduct token swaps with leading protocols</li>\n<li>Incentivize redelegation by tokenholders</li>\n<li>Highly targeted marketing</li>\n<li>Start a DAO DevRel team</li>\n<li>Provide DAO support services</li>\n<li>Gain unquestionable lead in defi, gaming, and RWAs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These goal suggestions were then broken down into strategies and measures. We relate this to a grant program in that most won’t be able to directly affect an objective like increasing the TVL. However, we can select them based on their alignment to ecosystem needs.</p>\n<p>If you’re thinking “Holy snozberries!!! Those North Star Metrics must have been drafted by some type of nincompoop”, don’t worry. This is only the first phase.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"next-steps-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#next-steps-2\"></a>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>We will be launching a survey to key delegates &amp; contributors to suggest anything missing. During this time, we will use what we have to guide our grant program coaching efforts.</p>\n<p>The results of the survey will be used to create a Snapshot vote allowing the full DAO to participate in ranking the Goals.</p>\n<p>Then, each grant program will need to show which ecosystem goals they are directly aiming to impact. They will articulate the strategy being used and the measure of their success.</p>\n<p>In the end, we will end up with grant programs having legitimate measures to understand their success or failure. It is important that an experimental program can fail at the pilot stage, but the incentive is normally to claim everything as a success. This ratified alignment and process requirement to improve communication at all levels of the program will be critical.</p>\n<p>Here are some more pictures of our OGSMs which were started during the final breakout session.

Users with pre-existing positions in eligible pools will only start earning rewards if they originally deposited it via the Shell app. Otherwise they must first withdraw, and then re-deposit their liquidity via the Shell app.</p>\n<p>ARB rewards will be applied to all DeFi protocols connected to the Shell Protocol network and supported by the Shell super dapp. These rewards will be additive with any additional ARB rewards and protocol-specific incentives. Supported protocols will include (but won’t be limited to): Aave, Balancer, Curve, Pendle, Beefy, and Shell-native protocols such as the Proteus AMM. More pools and protocols may be added as integrations are built out.</p>\n<p>The Shell super dapp enables cross-chain zaps directly into any Arbitrum DeFi protocol. In order to incentivize users to bridge onto Arbitrum, a higher concentration of the total ARB incentives will be applied to rewards for Arbitrum-native protocols (i.e., with majority TVL on Arbitrum).</p>\n<p><strong>10.

Here’s a summary of some of the key takeaways:</p>\n<p><strong>STIP incentives were highly effective at increasing primary KPIs.</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to the STIP, Notional on Arbitrum had ~$1.5M in TVL and ~$3M borrowed. Notional’s STIP incentives greatly catalyzed the growth of these metrics. At peak, Notional’s TVL grew to over $20M and the amount borrowed grew to over $60M.</p>\n<p><strong>STIP incentives drove attention to leveraged liquidity and away from leveraged vaults.</strong></p>\n<p>In our original STIP application, we put 100% of our incentives on providing fixed rate liquidity on Notional. This created a lot of fixed rate liquidity. But it had the side effect of taking attention away from Notional’s core leveraged vault products which borrow from Notional and deploy capital into external protocols to earn yield. The end result was that users focused much more on providing fixed rate liquidity than on utilizing fixed rate liquidity through Notional’s leveraged vault products.</p>\n<p>We think this end result suggests that it would be better to distribute incentives more equally between providing fixed rate liquidity on Notional vs. using leveraged vaults.</p>\n<p><strong>Leveraged liquidity user retention was not great.</strong></p>\n<p>We split Notional users into three groups: depositors (only supplied capital, didn’t borrow), leveraged liquidity users, and borrowers (posted collateral on Notional to borrow against it). We found that the retention among depositors and borrowers was much higher than for leveraged liquidity users.</p>\n<p>We think that this is another reason to tweak our incentive distribution method for the STIP Bridge. By directing some of the incentives away from providing fixed rate liquidity and toward different products, we think we can achieve greater retention and more sustainable protocol growth after the conclusion of the STIP Bridge.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a>New Plans for STIP Bridge</h4>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>How much are you requesting for this STIP Bridge proposal?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>250,000 ARB (50% of original grant)</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?

My primary piece of feedback for the application process was that it would have been good to have more contact with delegates while we were drafting our STIP application. This would have helped us better understand whether our request was in line with delegates’ expectations and whether there was anything we could change which would have made our application more attractive. The DAO has already responded to this feedback by adding the adviser role in the application process which I think will help a lot.</p>\n<p>With respect to the actual execution of the grant, we could use more help with distribution and discoverability. If the Foundation or DAO were able to help channel attention to different projects that have received grants or make it easier for users to find different opportunities that would be very beneficial. During the STIP Backfund, we did this with some other projects by using a Layer3 campaign. But if Arbitrum itself were able to lend some of its weight to initiatives like this it would be very impactful for grantees.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n

Stake DAO strategies were leading to short term TVL increase and new TVL mainly coming from somewhere else on Arbitrum. We therefore focused our deployment of the grant on bringing products from Ethereum to Arbitrum, to make sure that people had to bridge and add value to Arbitrum if they want to benefit it, while having no reason to go back to mainnet when the incentives will stop. We believe that this is the best way to convert this short term incentive plan into long term added value for Arbitrum.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><a name=\"new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#new-plans-for-stip-bridge-1\"></a><strong>New Plans for STIP Bridge</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to use the incentives in the same ways* as highlighted in Section 3 of the STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>[Only if answered “no” to the previous question] How will the incentive distribution change in terms of mechanisms and products?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The overall idea will stay the same, but we will focus on bringing long term value added to Arbitrum by focusing on bringing mainnet products on Arbitrum, and limiting the basic liquidity mining rewards. We will increase the number of services and options for users, so that Arbitrum becomes a much more complete place for our products than even mainnet. A good example is the financing of various lending markets for our products. We would like to also extend the use of our grant, not only to our Curve, but also to our Pendle products.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Could you provide the addresses involved in the STIP Bridge initiative (multisig to receive funds, contracts for distribution, and any other relevant contract involved), and highlight if they changed compared to the previous STIP proposal?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Recipient Multisig: 0x3B985f06D624C74F270daeCcDb65DcC6ee582372</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>asdCRV liquidity gauge: 0x25E822B65a58Ce1A53DbC327d4fA489351FB1Df0</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Could you share any feedback or suggestions on what could be improved in future incentive programs, what were the pain points and what was your general evaluation of the experience?</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Our main suggestions would be:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Having one point of contact with the Arbitrum team/foundation.
