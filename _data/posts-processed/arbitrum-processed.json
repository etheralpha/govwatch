Consequently, Radiant will adjust the incentive distribution from an 80-20 split to a 75-25 split between lenders and borrowers. This adjustment should enhance borrowing incentives without penalizing or discouraging deposits.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Radpie wstETH vault (104,166 ARB)</strong></p>\n<p>The wstETH market incentives have been running for the past week, initially supported solely by Radiant’s incentives. Thanks to an upcoming collaboration with Lido, who will match Radiant’s incentives for the market, Radiant expects a substantial increase in market participation.</p>\n<p>This wstETH initiative is carried out on Radpie due to its unique ability to create vaults with automatic 3.46x looping, which was desired by Lido to co-incentivize the market.</p>\n<p>Since the introduction of these incentives, there has been a clear increase in TVL, bolstering our confidence that the market will perform exceptionally well once the total planned incentives from both Radiant and Lido are in full effect. Prior to the initiative, the TVL stood at approximately $408k, and as of now, it has surged to $2.4M, marking an impressive growth of 490%.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/71c0c8f2ca5a37af3ba60a7fe4138685ed8c4bbb.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/geiZD15Sg4OyspN0GCnzmmWNjS3.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71c0c8f2ca5a37af3ba60a7fe4138685ed8c4bbb_2_690x257.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"geiZD15Sg4OyspN0GCnzmmWNjS3\" width=\"690\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71c0c8f2ca5a37af3ba60a7fe4138685ed8c4bbb_2_690x257.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71c0c8f2ca5a37af3ba60a7fe4138685ed8c4bbb_2_1035x385.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71c0c8f2ca5a37af3ba60a7fe4138685ed8c4bbb_2_1380x514.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F0F5F6\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Source:<a href=\"https://dune.com/radiant/arbitrum-stip-bridge\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> https://dune.com/radiant/arbitrum-stip-bridge</a></p>\n<p>Radiant and Lido will assess the campaign’s results after 30 days and determine whether to continue as planned or make adjustments.</p>\n<p><strong>3.

Therefore, a space on the X social network has been coordinated for Monday, July 1st. Radiant protocol will provide additional incentives before the event to gauge market reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Radpie USDC lenders (120,000 ARB)</strong></p>\n<p>The recent bull market has led to Radiant users choosing to de-prioritize holding stablecoins such as USDC, preferring leverage and volatile assets. This stance has led to a decrease in USDC lenders, causing USDC borrow rates to spike.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the need to stabilize these rates, Radiant is prioritizing efforts to enhance the native USDC market, in alignment with the goals of Arbitrum, Gauntlet, and Circle to foster greater adoption of this asset.</p>\n<p>This effort is being carried out through Radpie, leveraging previous STIP initiatives that incentivized stablecoin pools and yielded favorable outcomes. The initiative has already shown outstanding results within the first two days, with an initial TVL of 2.9M growing to 5.3M, reflecting an 82.75% increase. These promising outcomes reinforce Radiant’s confidence in enhancing market stability and promoting broader adoption of native USDC on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1atxDO6VkhzSn0Zo2aIrQQ5Svyr.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_690x449.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"1atxDO6VkhzSn0Zo2aIrQQ5Svyr\" width=\"690\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_690x449.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_1035x673.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/083158852bdb66683f2db07d3e7052a501851b73_2_1380x898.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"98E8FB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong>5.

The structure of the STIP Bridge incentive program is very different than the original STIP grant.</p>\n<p>30% of the STIP B grant will be given as incentives to LPs by the same mechanism as the STIP. This time around though, we will be focusing liquidity incentives on a smaller number of tokens.</p>\n<p>70% of the STIP B grant will be given to other kinds of users on Notional through the use of an off-chain points program. Total ARB incentives distributed through the points program will be 175,000 ARB over three 4-week seasons. Points are accrued during the season and then ARB distributions are made at the end of each season.</p>\n<p>This points program allows us significantly more flexibility in incentivizing different kinds of Notional users. In particular, we are focusing on borrowers and leveraged vault users. This focus is reflected by high point multipliers for borrowing (4x) and using a leveraged vault (8x), vs. lending (1x-2x).</p>\n<p>Full details of the points program on our dedicated dashboard:</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://notional.finance/points-dashboard/arbitrum\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://notional.finance/favicon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"23\" height=\"22\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://notional.finance/points-dashboard/arbitrum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">notional.finance</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/925b3655c761414db3867390b0994c19b38a3a5a_2_690x362.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"053845\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://notional.finance/points-dashboard/arbitrum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Notional Finance - DeFi lending and leveraged yield</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Lend, Borrow, and Earn Leveraged Yield with Fixed or Variable Rates</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Liquidity rewarder contracts:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Currency</th>\n<th>Contract Address</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ETH</td>\n<td>0x3987F211d4BA25B6FF163B56051651bF6c6c5e54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>0xE5b58DE62b71477aE4e10074fee48232DD7A2350</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>0xFc24ACF5BD2aFEe3efBd589F87B6610C9D162645</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wBTC</td>\n<td>0x8BC5600582c6c17194e4478C311d3133cf9361D2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wstETH</td>\n<td>0xd2Da21d240F093A38A143426D3cd62326FC496cc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FRAX</td>\n<td>0xA8cA4FA84933106a92D4fec68C8B5A057703e862</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rETH</td>\n<td>0xda99cd202bCac9f9c945fF2954e08EAec63B067d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>0xe670942CE88d0ac8E655d30E5EF0229e969de26C</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Contract address label <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2AYnjAaQjVOLtvemZpsWoN5sTJEJ8dLqdRDExTBQv_SUeug/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Form 20</a> completed for all addresses: Yes</p>\n<p>ARB left over: 0</p>\n<p>Plan for leftover ARB: Distribute over following periods</p>\n<p>Summary of incentives: LPs in the following currencies are currently being incentivized at the following weekly rates.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Currency</th>\n<th>Weekly ARB Emission Rate</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ETH</td>\n<td>2,083</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DAI</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>2,083</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wBTC</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wstETH</td>\n<td>416</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FRAX</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>rETH</td>\n<td>416</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>1250</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"stats-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stats-3\"></a>STATS</h2>\n<p>Average daily TVL: $6.93M</p>\n<p>Average daily transactions: 133</p>\n<p>Average daily volumes: $6.9M (average open debt)</p>\n<p>Number of unique user addresses: 4,349</p>\n<p>Transaction fees: $387</p>\n<p>Link to Dashboard showing metrics: <a href=\"https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-finance-v3-arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-finance-v3-arbitrum</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"plan-for-the-next-two-weeks-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#plan-for-the-next-two-weeks-4\"></a>Plan For the Next Two Weeks</h2>\n<p>Amount of ARB to be distributed: No change</p>\n<p>Contracts that will be incentivized: No change</p>\n<p>Contract address label <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2AYnjAaQjVOLtvemZpsWoN5sTJEJ8dLqdRDExTBQv_SUeug/viewform\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Form 20</a> completed for all addresses: Yes</p>\n<p>Mechanism for distribution incentives: No change</p>\n<p>Summary of incentives plan: No change</p>\n<p>Summary of changes to the original plan:</p>\n<p>The original plan involved a fixed allocation between lenders, borrowers, and leveraged vault users. However, this is very hard to achieve in practice without constantly tweaking point multipliers for each different product type given that points earned between different product types are fungible with one another.</p>\n<p>To ensure a fixed allocation between different product types, we would have needed to create three different kinds of points. We felt that this was impractical and have instead decided to focus on leveraged vault users and borrowers as we have found those users to be the most important in driving growth. Depending on the results in Season One, we may tweak point multipliers for the next season to respond to any issues we see in Season One.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/notional-stip-b-bi-weekly-update/25228\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/notional-stip-b-bi-weekly-update/25228","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 22:49:48 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25228"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/notional-stip-b-bi-weekly-update/25228.rss","#text":"Notional STIP-B Bi-Weekly Update"},"filter":true},{"title":"[Trader Joe] Bi-Weekly Report","dc:creator":"traderjoe","category":"Biweekly Updates (STIP)","description":"<h1><a name=\"introduction-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#introduction-1\"></a>Introduction</h1>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#recap-of-the-previous-two-weeks-2\"></a>Recap of the Previous Two Weeks</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>ARB Received Last Disbursement: [Insert amount of ARB]</li>\n<li>ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks: [Insert amount of ARB]</li>\n<li>ARB left over: [Insert amount of ARB]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks: [Insert all contract addresses incentivizes]</p>\n<p>Contract address label Form 49 completed for all addresses: [Insert Yes once Completed]</p>\n<h3><a name=\"plan-for-leftover-arb-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#plan-for-leftover-arb-3\"></a>Plan for leftover ARB</h3>\n<h3><a name=\"summary-of-incentives-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#summary-of-incentives-4\"></a>Summary of incentives</h3>\n<h3><a name=\"additional-info-disclosures-to-multisig-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#additional-info-disclosures-to-multisig-5\"></a>Additional Info / Disclosures to Multisig</h3>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"stats-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#stats-6\"></a>STATS</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Average daily TVL: [Insert stat]</li>\n<li>Average daily volumes: [Insert stat]</li>\n<li>Number of unique user addresses: [Insert stat]</li>\n<li>Transaction fees: [Insert stat]</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"link-to-dashboard-showing-metrics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#link-to-dashboard-showing-metrics-7\"></a>Link to Dashboard showing metrics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Link</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"plan-for-the-next-two-weeks-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#plan-for-the-next-two-weeks-8\"></a>Plan For the Next Two Weeks</h1>\n<p>Amount of ARB to be distributed: [Insert amount of ARB]</p>\n<p>Contracts that will be incentivized: [Insert all contract addresses]</p>\n<p>Contract address label Form 49 completed for all addresses: [Insert Yes once Completed]</p>\n<p>Mechanism for distribution incentives: [Insert all mechanism description]</p>\n<p>Summary of incentives plan: [Insert plan]</p>\n<p>Summary of changes to the original plan: [Insert changes]</p>\n            <p><small>1 post -

Timeboost enables auctions for the rights to an express lane, giving the winner an advantage for transaction inclusion and allowing them to potentially capture arbitrage and backrunning opportunities. Proceeds from the auction are at the discretion of the Arbitrum DAO, with two main options outlined in this proposal: collecting bids in ETH or collecting bids in ARB.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Arbitrum Chains currently order transactions on a First-Come First-Served basis (FCFS). The motivation to implement FCFS was twofold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Easy to understand and implement,</li>\n<li>Replicate Web2 user experience for instant transaction confirmation,</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unfortunately, relying solely on first-come first-served transaction ordering is not an ideal long-term solution.</p>\n<p>When opportunities to profitably arbitrage across exchanges arise on Arbitrum, “MEV Searchers” race to get their transaction included before anyone else so that they can capture this profit. This latency race involves a lot of spam, placing stress on chain infrastructure and causing searchers to wastefully invest in faster hardware. Furthermore, none of the MEV generated is captured by the chain and instead all profits are collected by searchers.</p>\n<p>Timeboost is a new transaction ordering policy that retains many of the great benefits currently in place for Arbitrum chains, including frontrunning protection and fast block times, while allowing the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p><strong>Sustainable</strong>: Timeboost offers the ArbitrumDAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users, since the value being captured already exists.</p>\n<p><strong>Technically-Inclusive</strong>: Rather than capturing arbitrage opportunities by having the fastest hardware, participants can win these opportunities by bidding in an auction.</p>\n<p><strong>Neutral and Open</strong>: The auction for the express lane is permissionless and participation is open to everyone, where the highest bid wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Empowerment</strong>: The Arbitrum DAO can configure all aspects of Timeboost, including enabling or disabling it, the auction’s design, and how to handle proceeds.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-terms-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-4\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<p><strong>Express Lane</strong>: A separate path for submitting transactions to the sequencer that has priority access compared to normally submitted transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>MEV</strong>: Maximal extractible value. In the context of Timeboost, MEV refers to the maximum amount of profit someone could make by including their transactions slightly faster than anyone else.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-5\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The full specification for the Timeboost auction can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/timeboost-design</a></p>\n<p>Arbitrum chains that adopt Timeboost will have two paths for transaction submission:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Normal path</strong>: Transactions in the normal path will experience a short delay (defaulted to 200ms) but will otherwise remain unchanged.</li>\n<li><strong>Express lane</strong>: Transactions in the express lane do not experience any delay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Access to the express lane would be auctioned off in one-minute rounds, with the auction happening 15 seconds before the round begins. Bids are kept private until after the bid submission deadline, and the auction winner will pay the same price as the second-highest bid of that round. There are two main components that facilitate the express lane auction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Auction contract</strong>: Prospective bidders must deposit funds into the auction contract before bidding in the auction. The contract is also responsible for verifying bidders’ signatures, checking auction contract account balances, deducting the second-highest bid amount from the account of the highest bidder, and handling the proceeds.</li>\n<li><strong>Autonomous auctioneer</strong>: An offchain program that captures bids from participants and reports the top two bids to the auction contract. This AIP proposes that the sequencer act as the autonomous auctioneer if Timeboost is adopted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed version of Timeboost is compatible with a centralized sequencer, however, the Timeboost policy will be compatible with proposals for a decentralized sequencer. 3% of auction proceeds would be left aside for the Arbitrum Developer Guild, which helps fund core Arbitrum development.</p>\n<p>The ArbitrumDAO can configure the currency in which bids are collected and how the auction proceeds are handled. This AIP proposes two main options that the community can vote on if it decides to adopt Timeboost. Governance can change these options at any time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Collect ETH</strong>: Collect bids in ETH and send the proceeds to the DAO treasury.</li>\n<li><strong>Burn ARB</strong>: Collect bids in ARB and burn the proceeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on which option the Arbitrum DAO chooses, the auction contract can either transfer the proceeds to a designated account or burn them.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-6\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discussion of the proposal on the forum and governance call(s)</li>\n<li>A vote on Snapshot to decide between Option 1 (collect ETH), Option 2 (burn ARB), or Option 3 (don’t adopt Timeboost)</li>\n<li>Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet</li>\n<li>An onchain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>19 posts - 17 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Jun 2024 02:49:58 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25167"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-proposal-to-adopt-timeboost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy/25167.rss","#text":"Constitutional AIP: Proposal to adopt Timeboost, a new transaction ordering policy"},"filter":false},{"title":"What is Next for Blockchain Gaming in 2024?

Content Creation Fellowship: Community-Driven Research Initiative to Empower the Arbitrum DAO</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fellowship Members:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Humberto Beso Oberto</li>\n<li>Ceci Sakura</li>\n<li>Nestor Bonilla</li>\n<li>Habib Maltiba</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Greetings Arbitrum DAO community!</p>\n<p>The Education &amp; Content Creation Fellowship has been hard at work for the past nine weeks, and we’re excited to share our progress and our vision for the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Shifting Focus to Empower the DAO:</strong></p>\n<p>We initially explored a wide range of ideas, from hackathon coordination to builder camps. For deciding which one to pursue we looked for the Arbitrum guidelines or any sort of North Star. However, we found out that aside clear technical topics like Stylus, there was no agreed goal beyond the Community Values. From asking around different contributors and looking into education and content proposals we identified the process has been carried out as an experiment without a set of goals and criteria to measure progress against.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we recognized that our most impactful contribution would be to empower the DAO with a deep understanding of its specific needs in Education and Content Creation. To achieve this, we’re developing a comprehensive, data-driven research initiative to ensure our work aligns perfectly with the DAO’s goals and priorities.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Goals:</strong></p>\n<p>Our research focuses on the ongoing Questbook round named Arbitrum Education, Community Growth, and Events Domain. Answering the following three key questions will allow the DAO and the grant operators to optimize its budget allocation so to accelerate growth of those projects that add to the financial sustainability for the long-term health of the Arbitrum ecosystem, and enable both social and technical inclusivity:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the most pressing educational needs of the Arbitrum DAO?</li>\n<li>What common metrics have been achieved by approved projects in the “Arbitrum Education, Community Growth, and Events” category on Questbook?</li>\n<li>How do these metrics align with Arbitrum’s DAO Community Values and the identified pressing needs?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Research Approach:</strong></p>\n<p>To gather this essential information, we’ll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct a targeted survey of delegates, Arbitrum Foundation collaborators, and ARB token holders.</li>\n<li>Thoroughly analyze the descriptions, milestones, and metrics of approved projects.</li>\n<li>Engage in in-depth interviews with key stakeholders to gain valuable insights.</li>\n<li>Leverage innovative tools, such as Farcaster frames, to gather survey data linked to wallets involved in the DAO, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of our research.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Value We Bring to the DAO:</strong></p>\n<p>Our research will equip the DAO with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A crystal-clear understanding of the community’s educational priorities.</li>\n<li>Data-driven insights into the effectiveness of past initiatives.</li>\n<li>Actionable recommendations to guide future funding decisions and maximize impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re finalizing our research proposal and will be applying for funding through Questbook by June 29th.</li>\n<li>We’re committed to transparent communication and will share regular updates on our progress, actively seeking your feedback throughout the research process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We Value Your Input!</strong></p>\n<p>We invite you to share your thoughts, suggestions, and any questions you have about this initiative. Your input is invaluable in shaping our research and ensuring its relevance to the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Please stay tuned for further updates!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for your continued support!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Education &amp; Content Creation Fellowship</strong></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/update-from-the-education-content-creation-fellowship-community-driven-research-initiative-to-empower-the-arbitrum-dao/25148\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/update-from-the-education-content-creation-fellowship-community-driven-research-initiative-to-empower-the-arbitrum-dao/25148","pubDate":"Wed, 26 Jun 2024 03:02:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25148"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/update-from-the-education-content-creation-fellowship-community-driven-research-initiative-to-empower-the-arbitrum-dao/25148.rss","#text":"Update from the Education & Content Creation Fellowship: Community-Driven Research Initiative to Empower the Arbitrum DAO"},"filter":false},{"title":"Thank ARB monthly update: May 2024","dc:creator":"katharina_thrive","category":"Grants Discussions","description":"<p>Hi there, Arbitrum community <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wave.png?v=12\" title=\":wave:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wave:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>I am <a href=\"https://x.com/savannastork\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kat</a>, and I am the Thank ARB Grants Manager.

Additionally, GG20 was supercharged with strategic rewards and impact assessment via Thrive Protocol, offering builders, promoters, curators, and program managers reward opportunities for contributions that boosted community engagement in the round, attracted top talent to the Arbitrum ecosystem, and generally promoted wider adoption of Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The donation phase closed on May 7th. GG20 achieved its immediate goals by allocating and distributing 100k across both Open Source Software and community rounds and budgeting an additional 100k for impact-based incentives. It facilitated over 35,000 addresses transacting on Arbitrum, resulting in more than $2 million in total transactions, including matching funds from Gitcoin. Additionally, the number of open-source projects doubled, and Arbitrum was highlighted as the default network for all grant rounds, with Gitcoin committing to continue this partnership through 2024. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/muscle.png?v=12\" title=\":muscle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":muscle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"firestarters-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#firestarters-6\"></a>Firestarters</h3>\n<p>The second program funded by our pluralist grants program is the Firestarters program.

Rather than formally updating the language of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, the chosen guidelines can be seen as a common social agreement between delegates. This proposal carries no cost to the DAO, and the guidelines can be implemented by the start of August if passed through a Snapshot vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-4\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Since its inception, the Arbitrum DAO has voted on over 280 Snapshots and 30 onchain votes. First anticipated almost a <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-1-time-management-in-arbitrumdao-governance/15718\">year</a> ago by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cattin\">@cattin</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedlatam\">@seedlatam</a>, as the operations of the DAO continue to grow, a more efficient and predictable governance process is needed to prevent delegate fatigue.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-5\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>Our team considered several possibilities for structuring Arbitrum DAO’s governance processes. This included creating voting periods organized around a monthly calendar or continuously repeating three week cycles. While both of those structures would greatly increase predictability and allow for the possibility of predetermined rest periods, they each come with tradeoffs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Condensing the availability of when a proposal can be posted to a vote creates an incentive to rush proposals. This can be detrimental to overall proposal quality.</li>\n<li>There is the potential to induce delegate fatigue if there is an overwhelming amount of votes all pushed into one short period.\n<ul>\n<li>Limiting the number of votes in each batch opens up further questions on how to prioritize which proposals are included.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The DAO has typically <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915\">seen</a> a 14 day application window for RFPs. Ensuring elections begin in a timely manner post RFP is an additional consideration that adds complexity to any designed structure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous conversations on the DAO’s process have also included introducing <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915\">standard guidelines for elections</a> or an Arbitrum Delegate Code of Conduct. These are topics that Entropy Advisors is beginning to work on as well, but in this case we believe it is better to start by leaning on the side of simplicity.</p>\n<p>Knowing that more complex structures can always be implemented later, below we propose the adoption of a set day each week for votes to start as well as a holiday break. Both of these would greatly increase predictability for delegates and can be adopted by the DAO without much of an adjustment period.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>This proposal does not seek to alter the language of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, but rather create an agreed upon social contract between delegates on best practices in regards to posting proposals to a Snapshot or Tally vote.</p>\n<p>Our primary objective is to improve predictability and reduce the potential for delegate fatigue. Based on these priorities below are specifications for the two recommended adjustments to Arbitrum DAO’s governance processes.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"start-all-votes-on-thursdays-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#start-all-votes-on-thursdays-7\"></a>Start all votes on Thursdays</h3>\n<p>By starting both Snapshot and Tally votes on Thursday, the DAO can not only increase predictability for delegates, but also prevent the scenario where votes begin/end on weekends.</p>\n<p>In order for a Tally vote to start on Thursday, it must be posted on Monday given the 3-day delay from when a proposal is posted until voting begins. Each batch of proposals ready to move to a Snapshot vote can be scheduled beforehand beginning on Monday and through Wednesday. We encourage delegates to post/schedule votes to begin before Thursday at 12 pm UTC. While not a hard deadline, this will help ensure any votes start for a majority of delegates worldwide.</p>\n<p>Overall, this allows delegates who don’t follow discussions as closely a few days to see what will be voted on and properly prepare. Additionally, with multiple opportunities each month to move a proposal forward to a vote, the incentive to rush the process is reduced.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"holiday-break-december-20-january-6th-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#holiday-break-december-20-january-6th-8\"></a>Holiday Break: December 20 - January 6th</h3>\n<p>Implement a holiday break to ensure delegates have a break and can return refreshed for the new year. During this time it is advised that no new proposals are posted to the forums and only emergency proposals are put up to a vote.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"optional-delegate-approval-process-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#optional-delegate-approval-process-9\"></a>Optional: Delegate Approval Process</h3>\n<p>Recently, we have noticed a trend within Arbitrum DAO of delegates waiting until a proposal makes it to a Snapshot for feedback to be given. This has resulted in some proposals being posted to Snapshot prematurely. We assume this is a result of several factors including the increasing amount of topics delegates must stay up to date on and the fact that there are no specific guidelines on how much discussion is required before moving a proposal forward.</p>\n<p>It would likely be very difficult to achieve DAO wide consensus on what specific requirements should be implemented to determine when a proposal is ready to move to a Snapshot vote. Thus a level of subjectivity is required and taking inspiration from procedures within Optimism DAO, a delegate approval process can be adopted.</p>\n<p>There are currently 64 delegates with greater than 500k in voting power (VP), so our recommended threshold for delegate approval is either a cumulative of 20m VP (requires at least 2 delegates) or 6 delegates (~10% of delegates with necessary power to post votes). If a proposal reaches either of the thresholds, it can be considered that there is consensus among enough delegates that it is ready to move forward.</p>\n<p>To signal their support of a proposal, delegates can post a statement similar to the following: “I am an Arbitrum delegate with xx voting power and believe this proposal is ready to move forward to Snapshot”.</p>\n<p>This approach introduces its own set of tradeoffs. While it would likely prevent premature proposals from going to a Snapshot vote, it does increase delegate responsibilities and can risk proposals authored by new contributors getting stuck due to the lack of connections to large delegates. Therefore we are presenting this as an option separate from the aforementioned adoptions and would welcome feedback from the community.</p>\n<p>To help encourage delegates to take on this additional responsibility, as part of the <a href=\"https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">delegate incentive program</a> a bonus point can be awarded to delegates on Karma who approve a proposal that eventually passes on Snapshot or Tally. This is just a suggestion and something we will leave to the discretion of the <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedlatam\">@seedlatam</a> team.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"additional-considerations-emergency-proposals-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#additional-considerations-emergency-proposals-10\"></a>Additional Considerations: Emergency Proposals</h3>\n<p>In the event of an emergency proposal that is time-sensitive in nature we recommend that any adopted guidelines be waived and the proposal be put up to a vote immediately. In our opinion, only Constitutional AIPs that relate to security matters should be considered as emergency proposals.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"steps-to-implement-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-11\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<p>Any changes made to the DAO’s procedures need to be widely communicated and accessible for potential new members. Otherwise, there are minimal steps needed to implement other than coordinating delegates and helping the DAO adjust to the adopted changes.</p>\n<p>Entropy will also be responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding the agreed upon guidelines to the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/ground-rules/10\">Ground Rules Topic</a> so that it is easy for new community members to discover and access.

The main objective is to address the risk of dependency on a single point of failure presented by the sequencer.</p>\n<p>The proposal focuses on decentralization and empowering users through an open-source approach, enabling other teams to deploy their own versions of the interface. This initiative not only enhances the network’s resilience but also provides users with greater control and confidence in the Arbitrum ecosystem. By enabling direct transaction submission to L1, users can bypass potential issues with the sequencer or any attempts at censorship, thereby ensuring uninterrupted transaction capabilities. This approach also upholds Arbitrum’s trustless security model, reinforcing the integrity of its Rollup technology even during operational challenges.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"arbitrums-forum-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#arbitrums-forum-3\"></a>Arbitrum’s Forum</h2>\n<p>Last February, we submitted a proposal to the Arbitrum Foundation Forum.

The WakeUp Team’s research will be made public, with a summary shared in an X (Twitter) thread and a detailed article posted in the OSS GitHub repository once it’s completed. This document will also outline the necessary security measures for the development process.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Endpoint Development</strong></em><br>\nCreation of endpoints to interact with the backend logic.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Logic Integration and Testing</strong></em><br>\nConnecting the frontend to the endpoints and verifying the operational logic, and test heavily the MVP.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Design Phase</strong></em><br>\nAdditional time allocated for the design process, ensuring a user-friendly experience.</p>\n<p><em><strong>UI Development</strong></em><br>\nWe’ll craft an aesthetic and intuitive user interface inspired by existing high-quality designs. To enhance user security, we’ll add a banner at the top of the website to verify the URL and guard against phishing sites.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Enhancing Documentation Clarity and Usability</strong></em><br>\nWe will finalize and clearly document the open-source codebase. As mentioned above, any team should be able to run their own instance of the service, so it’s crucial that everything is clearly explained. We’ll also include a list of URLs for instances set up by others that we have verified as correctly implemented.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Service &amp; Maintenance after Launch</strong></em><br>\nWe are committed to hosting the site on either Vercel or AWS, ensuring continuous operation 24/7 for a minimum of 24 months. Once we achieve a stable version that has been thoroughly tested, we will also deploy an instance on IPFS to offer a fully decentralized option. While this may not be the most performant choice initially, it will be available for at least these 2 years, with plans to extend indefinitely after evaluating its performance.</p>\n<p>At WakeUp Labs we will initially refine the website based on user and Arbitrum community feedback, conducting ongoing testing to maintain reliability. Any issues such as downtime or crashes will be promptly addressed by our team for at least the next two years.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Estimated Timeframe</strong></em><br>\nApproximately 4.5 months for full implementation, including design phases, followed by 3 months dedicated to post-launch iterations. We will then commit to hosting, monitoring, and addressing any possible errors for 24 months after launch.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusions-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusions-6\"></a>Conclusions.</h2>\n<p>Developing a front-end interface to facilitate force-including transactions during Sequencer downtime is a crucial initiative within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal aims to empower users by ensuring they can execute transactions even when the Sequencer is unavailable. This effort aligns closely with Arbitrum’s objectives of decentralization and bolstering user autonomy.</p>\n<p>To ensure the solution is effective during critical scenarios, it’s essential that other projects can independently deploy their own instances of this service. This is why the project is conceived as open-source from inception, and we are committed to actively supporting teams interested in adopting it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"whats-next-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#whats-next-7\"></a>What’s Next?</h2>\n<p>As we embark on the first phase — Technical Research, POC, Documentation, and Testing — we will keep you updated with all the progress!</p>\n<p>Also, you can check out our <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wakeup-labs-general-comms-thread-our-journey-on-arbitrum/25128\">general communications thread</a> on this forum to learn more about us and what we’re building on Arbitrum!</p>\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wakeuplabs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X</a> (Twitter) and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/wakeuplabs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">LinkedIn</a>! <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12\" title=\":sparkles:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":sparkles:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wakeup-labs-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/25134\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wakeup-labs-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/25134","pubDate":"Tue, 25 Jun 2024 08:07:56 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25134"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wakeup-labs-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/25134.rss","#text":"WakeUp Labs: Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime"},"filter":false},{"title":"WakeUp Labs - General Comms Thread Our Journey on Arbitrum","dc:creator":"WakeUp_Labs","category":"Governance","description":"<h2><a name=\"tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#tldr-1\"></a>TL,DR.</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wakeuplabs.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">WakeUp Labs</a> is a studio offering advanced development services to EVM-Compatible Chains, DAOs, and businesses.

As many delegates indicated during the vote that RWA ecosystem growth is a priority of the STEP program, we threshed out a more equitable distribution.<br>\nFor future iterations, we suggest making the relative priority of objectives more clear. For example, if ecosystem growth is the most important, a single yes vote from any committee member should be enough for a provider to get included in an allocation instead of a majority. There could also be clear stipulations in future programs on how much extra allocation can go to existing providers versus new ones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While De-Fi support programs succeed through user or liquidity incentives, RWA providers care most about their AUM. We need some innovation for what ecosystem support in the RWA space can be that goes beyond AUM, such as subsidizing obtaining Moody ratings. We hope to see good work coming on this front from the recently approved <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/decentralized-review-process-summary-thank-arb-milestone-1b/24877\">RWA program</a> from Areta.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some additional considerations the committee considered for narrowing the list from 17 providers</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No investment restrictions</strong>, especially worrisome if a provider can use <strong>leverage</strong> and <strong>hedging</strong> at discretion of the manager. As one of the committee members expressed, we need something beyond common sense that stops a provider from taking our money and putting it into Argentinian peso bonds.</li>\n<li><strong>Segregated portfolio companies with multiple portfolios</strong> are an added risk. Bankruptcy remote is not just having separate bank accounts, creditors look at whether entities are in actuality separate (their own board meeting minutes, payroll with staff, etc) so that the subsidiary entities do not get rolled into the parent one during proceedings.</li>\n<li>Products with a <strong>tiny AUM</strong>, <strong>exposure to a single ISIN</strong> or having <strong>fund managers without extensive prior experience</strong> or <strong>outsourced</strong> to third parties are riskier bets</li>\n<li>Providers using their <strong>own proprietary blockchain</strong> or solely that of a <strong>competitor</strong> were passed on in this round</li>\n<li><strong>Decentralized governance</strong> of underlying assets which require additional due diligence and/or have exposure to the Foundation for the same add an extra layer of unpredictability</li>\n<li><strong>Redemption</strong> procedures have a <strong>lag</strong> period measured in weeks or months or are limited to a <strong>single stablecoin</strong> that is not USDC, USDT or DAI or require a bank transfer</li>\n<li><strong>Insufficient documentation</strong> such as not providing a PPM, investment memo, counterparty for reverse repos, guidelines, restrictions, having annual audits only or from unknown auditors or managers</li>\n<li><strong>High fees</strong> that are uncompetitive in the current rates environment</li>\n<li>Appears unlikely unlikely to develop <strong>secondary market liquidity</strong> to underwrite against</li>\n<li><strong>Operationally burdensome</strong> and requires more active oversight than is desired since individual issuances mature without auto-roll</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>We will keep a comment period of ~10 days before moving for Snapshot approval of the recommendations on Monday 1st July.</p>\n<p>We shall host office hours on this <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/xuw-buwo-dww\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">link</a> with members of the committee on Wednesday (28th June) at 330 pm UTC to address any questions.

ARB holders who stake and delegate their governance power to an active governance participant (either themselves or another entity) will receive surplus sequencer fees proportional to their share of total ARB staked.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO has accumulated over <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/treasury\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">$50M of ETH</a> in surplus fees from Arbitrum One and Nova. Meanwhile, only about 10% of the circulating supply of ARB (roughly $324 million of ARB) is actively used in governance (see “delegated tokens” on Tally’s <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">delegation page</a>). The number of unique voters participating in the DAO has been <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3829223/6440489\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">steadily declining</a> since DAO launch. As a result, it is becoming economically attractive to attack the DAO treasury. The upside of attacking the DAO treasury is increasing (more ETH in the treasury), while the cost of attacking the DAO is not increasing proportionally to defend against attacks. A more developed version of this dynamic exists in the ENS and Compound DAOs, both of which are actively fighting off governance attacks (ENS <a href=\"https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/10\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documented here</a>).</p>\n<p>ARB Staking can improve the Arbitrum DAO’s security by incentivizing ARB holders to be actively engaged in governance. Instead of accumulating ETH into an onchain treasury that inevitably becomes a honeypot for governance attacks, ETH is used to reward ARB token holders who are contributing to the long-term health of Arbitrum.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>This proposal contributes to Arbitrum <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Community Values</a> by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure. ARB staking addresses an emerging economic vulnerability in the Arbitrum DAO by perpetually incentivizing ARB token holders to engage in effective governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-and-steps-to-implement-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-and-steps-to-implement-5\"></a>Specifications and Steps to Implement</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"rewards-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rewards-6\"></a>Rewards</h3>\n<p>We propose that 50% of surplus sequencer fees be allocated to ARB stakers. The existing DAO treasury of ETH from surplus sequencer fees would be unchanged, only future fees would be affected.</p>\n<p>If we assume a 1:1 conversion of the current <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">delegated ARB</a> (~324M) to staked ARB and assume 12K ETH (roughly the historical annual rate) in annual <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/treasury\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">surplus fees</a> accumulated, then at an ARB price of $1 and an ETH price of $3800 this would equal to roughly a 7% annual reward rate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annual surplus fees in USD: 12,000 ETH * 50% * $3,800/ETH = $22,800,000</li>\n<li>Staked ARB in USD: 324,000,000 ARB * $1/ARB = $324,000,000</li>\n<li>Annual Reward Rate: $22,800,000 / $324,000,000 = 0.07 or 7%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect all of the variables involved in the reward rate to evolve significantly over time. In particular, we think it’s important to consider the following items because they may have a material impact on rewards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently, there is no direct incentive to delegate ARB tokens. ARB staking introduces a direct incentive to stake and delegate. As a result, it’s reasonable to assume that the amount of staked and delegated ARB will significantly increase over time.</li>\n<li>In conjunction with the recent EIP 4844 upgrade, Arbitrum recently dramatically <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-gas-fees-sequencer-revenue/24730\">underpriced its gas fee</a>. As a result, the amount of surplus ETH accumulating in the DAO treasury over time has decreased significantly. We believe this situation is temporary and is likely to be addressed by increasing the gas fee in the near future, but it’s worth noting that at this time the rate of surplus fee accumulation is significantly lower than the historical norm.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"arbitrum-staking-specification-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#arbitrum-staking-specification-7\"></a>Arbitrum staking specification</h3>\n<p>Our implementation of Arbitrum Staking builds on top of <a href=\"https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Unistaker</a>. In addition to customizing Unistaker for Arbitrum’s <a href=\"https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">governance architecture</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/fee-distribution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fee collection mechanism</a>, we add features designed to improve governance outcomes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We require that tokens be delegated to an active delegate.</li>\n<li>We direct 1% of surplus fees proportionally to delegates, with both fee streams going to the token holder if they are delegated to themselves and active.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We define an active delegate as a delegate with a Karma Score over 80. We use an oracle to represent Karma Score within the staking system. Receiving an accurate Karma score requires delegates to <a href=\"https://www.karmahq.xyz/dao/link/forum?dao=arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sign a message</a> and post it on the forum as a way to prove that the forum user is truly the owner of the delegation address. Karma Score is calculated according to the following formula:</p>\n<p>((100) * ((Forum Activity Score * 1) + (Off-chain Votes % * 3) + (On-chain Votes % * 5))) / (Sum of Weights times Max Score Setting * 1)</p>\n<p>Our staking implementation directs 1% of surplus fees to delegates to sustain the ongoing growth and development of Arbitrum, a large portion of which is driven by the DAO. In its current form, ARB staking is not meant to replace the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/delegate-incentives-program/30\">delegate incentives program</a>, but rather to complement it with a smaller source of incentives that are programmatically tied to ongoing network operations. In the future, we believe it could make sense to integrate the delegate incentives program with ARB staking so that, instead of getting delegate incentive funds from the ARB treasury, they come directly from DAO revenue.</p>\n<p>Tally will build ARB staking into our existing <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Arbitrum DAO platform</a>, so that users can easily stake and delegate in one place.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"integration-with-future-arbitrum-staking-systems-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#integration-with-future-arbitrum-staking-systems-8\"></a>Integration with future Arbitrum staking systems</h3>\n<p>We anticipate that additional Arbitrum staking systems will be developed over time, perhaps to incentivize decentralized block production in BoLD or to create an efficient MEV market in Time Boost. We view multiple staking systems as complementary. Each system would ask the staker to do different work for Arbitrum, take different risks, and pay out different rewards. Having multiple systems lets ARB holders pick between different risk/reward payoffs and specialize in different types of work to secure the system.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"liquid-staked-arb-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#liquid-staked-arb-9\"></a>Liquid staked ARB</h3>\n<p>Tally is building a governance-compatible LST to enable staked positions to participate in governance while being liquid. By staking ARB on the Tally Protocol, users will receive a liquid staked ARB token that auto-compounds rewards, is restakeable, and is compatible with DeFi. Tally’s ARB LST automates the process of accessing rewards for token holders by automatically claiming staking rewards and redepositing them back into the staking contract. We plan to work closely with Arbitrum ecosystem DeFi protocols and restaking systems to enhance composability and utility of the Tally ARB LST. The ARB LST will be an exchange token, which means the staking rewards will accumulate by increasing the exchange rate of the token (rather than by increasing the account balance).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"estimated-timeline-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#estimated-timeline-10\"></a>Estimated Timeline</h2>\n<p>Post proposal on forum for feedback: June</p>\n<p>Post temp check proposal on Snapshot: July</p>\n<p>Begin smart contract development (if temp check passes): July</p>\n<p>Submit smart contracts for audit: August</p>\n<p>Submit onchain proposal on Tally including full ARB Staking implementation and retro funding: September</p>\n<h2><a name=\"overall-cost-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#overall-cost-11\"></a>Overall Cost</h2>\n<p>This proposal will not be submitted onchain until ARB Staking is completed and audited.
