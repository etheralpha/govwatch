The <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-to-backfund-successful-stip-proposals-savvy-dao-final/19046\">STIP Backfund proposal</a> was introduced to fund all the STIP applications that were approved but were not funded because the budget ran out. The distribution for STIP and Backfund incentives was extended to March 2024, while the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223\">Long Term Incentives Pilot Program (LTIPP)</a> was introduced in December 2023 and was poised to run from January 2024 to April 2024. Lastly, we had the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353\">STIP-Bridge</a> proposal that was meant to mitigate the ‘unfair’ advantage that protocols distributing incentives from LTIPP would have over those distributing incentives from STIP &amp; Backfund after the latter programs had expired.</p>\n<p>Anyone who followed the discussions around the different proposals and programs is familiar with the fact that time constraints played a significant role in why we didn’t stop to analyze the data collected and iterate based on that. We needed to maintain momentum and remain competitive with other L2s, especially while the market was overall bullish.</p>\n<p>Things have changed over the past few months, and the need for an incentive program that accounts for all the data that we have collected through the past programs has become apparent. Our proposal is a social agreement (we will post a temperature check vote on Snapshot but there will be no on-chain proposal) to use the 3 months following the conclusion of LTIPP and STIP Bridge explicitly to reflect on the learnings, to design &amp; refine a program based on them, as well as on the feedback of key stakeholders.</p>\n<p>We know incentives are a vital part of protocol and ecosystem growth in crypto, and we want to help create a perpetual program that leverages incentives in the most efficient way to create the biggest positive impact on the protocols receiving them.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h3>\n<p>There are already hundreds of data points to review, analyze, and ultimately distill into actionable insights on what works and what doesn’t in terms of incentives.

If it successfully passes temp-check, the proposed 3-month break from incentive programs will begin on September 17th, given that LTIPP and STIP Bridge incentive distribution timeframe conclude on September 2nd and September 16th respectively.</p>\n<p>Within 2 weeks of a successful temp-check, we will facilitate the revival of the incentives working group and invite delegates, researchers who have conducted analysis, protocol builders, and other relevant stakeholders to participate in the working group.</p>\n<p>L2BEAT does not wish to lead the working group, and we’d instead prefer to facilitate its creation and then step back and participate in it as delegates by providing our feedback and opinions. We do commit, however, to remaining active in the working group and helping drive the discussion forward.</p>\n<p>Once the working group has been formed, it should regularly meet and work towards designing an incentive program that accounts for as many of the insights we’ve gathered as possible without sacrificing operational efficiency and introducing too many complicated and unnecessary structures.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"steps-to-implement-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-6\"></a>Steps to implement</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>This RFC collects feedback and goes to Snapshot.</li>\n<li>The proposal passes Snapshot successfully.</li>\n<li>We ‘revive’ the incentives working group and invite all relevant stakeholders to participate.</li>\n<li>We collectively start designing and refining a long-term incentives program based on all the data we’ve gathered.</li>\n<li>On September 17th, the 3-month incentives break period begins.</li>\n<li>Ideally, by the conclusion of the 3-months break, we will be able to transform the design into an actionable program that can be submitted to the DAO as a proposal.</li>\n<li>[Optional] If 6 doesn’t happen from the working group itself, then we should at least create an overview of principles any future incentive program must take into account in order to be considered by the DAO.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"timeline-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-7\"></a>Timeline</h3>\n<p>The proposed timeline for the incentives detox is 3 months.

If the DAO decides to stake, we recommend gradual investment into a regularly-rebalanced, diversified portfolio of LSTs actively managed in a DAO Treasury Management Vault to minimize trust and mitigate centralization while enabling adaptability to changing risk tolerance and market conditions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"staking-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#staking-overview-2\"></a>Staking Overview</h2>\n<p>Staking ETH is part of the proof-of-stake process for Ethereum mainnet. Stakers are allowed to propose/validate specific, new blocks and attest to a correct path through the block tree building a canonical block chain as it goes. If a staker does not attest to a block at the right time they will lose part of their staked funds. Doing everything correctly currently gains stakers about 3% of their stake per year, making staking <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&amp;field_tdr_date_value_month=202406\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">yield less than US treasuries</a> but more attractive than just holding ETH in a wallet.</p>\n<p>Staking, however, does have some interesting systemic concerns. For example, an entity that controls 33% of all staked ETH can delay finality which some have compared to holding finality hostage. An entity that controls 50% can begin to manipulate block chain fork choice and censor a small amount of blocks. An entity that controls 66% cannot forge transactions but otherwise completely controls what transactions occur on the network. They can censor and reorder transactions at will (including even halting finality). This allows them to dictate the rules of the mempool and have a powerful voice for their future vision of the network. Lido (discussed below) has <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">flirted with the 33% threshold</a> in the past and there are serious concerns that centralized exchanges could amass a concerning amount as well. The concentration of ETH is something that should be monitored regularly by the community. The worst-case scenario is that individual entities would be incentivized to create a cartel and reach the larger, more powerful thresholds that no one member of the cartel can reach on their own. Users aware of this possibility can counteract it by diversifying what entities they stake with. Self-staking would be one way to implement such a strategy and would contribute to the decentralization of the network.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"staking-options-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#staking-options-3\"></a>Staking Options</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"self-staking-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#self-staking-4\"></a>Self-Staking</h3>\n<p>Self-staking is when users stake their own ETH by running their own validator node. This allows users to have full control over their funds so that they are able to withdraw their stake when and where they choose while also contributing to the decentralization of the network. The tradeoff for more control, though, is more responsibility. Should a user’s hardware go offline and the node not be present when they are required, they will be penalized the rewards amount they would have made. Worse, if a node makes a serious mistake (like proposing two different blocks) then they will lose a significant portion of their staked amount. The Ethereum Foundation documents the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">necessary validator software for a node</a> so getting started should be quite easy.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-5\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Running a node requires mitigations of the operational risks</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hardware Failure</strong>: hardware failing would create downtime for the node and penalties\n<ul>\n<li>What redundancy solutions are in place?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>DDoS attacks</strong>: the node being down could cost you penalties\n<ul>\n<li>Are you implementing methods to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Node Software Bugs</strong>: The software running the node could have bugs causing the node to have bad behavior and be penalized. The worst case scenario can occur when a <a href=\"https://clientdiversity.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">super majority of all clients</a> run the same node software implementation. A bug in this case could mean all these nodes reaching finality on incorrect blocks and getting slashed on the chain that did not encounter the bug.\n<ul>\n<li>What execution client is running? consensus client? Are they part of a super majority of clients being run?</li>\n<li>What will the software be running on? Is it reliable?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Web2 Attack vectors</strong>: A node machine connected to the internet could receive malware. Worst case scenario is the heist of the node’s private keys. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aP9f_1v9Ulc?t=1740\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vitalik cited this as the reason for him not staking his entire ETH amount</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>Are you following good security practices?</li>\n<li>Who has access to the machine and what powers do they have?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mitigation of these risks usually requires utilizing battle-tested <a href=\"https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">resources and practices</a>. The good news is that spinning up a node and a secure plan for its operation can take place on the <a href=\"https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Holesky testnet</a>. Users should spend time assessing their node setup and effectiveness on this testnet prior to moving to mainnet.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"staking-as-a-service-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#staking-as-a-service-6\"></a>Staking As A Service</h3>\n<p>Staking-as-a-service (<strong>SaaS</strong> or sometimes <strong>StaaS</strong>) allows users to outsource the running of the validator node to a hired operator. There are two large distinctions here: custodial and non-custodial. Custodial SaaS means delivering complete control of your funds to an entity who promises to stake and reward in a certain way but users have no control over their funds, the entity’s behavior, and the regulatory regime of the entity. Examples of this are centralized exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/staking\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/features/staking-coins\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kraken</a>. Not only can the exchange’s regulatory regime change haphazardly and without warning, but the exchange itself also has its own security practices which may or may not be disclosed or correct and many numerous exchanges have lost user funds.</p>\n<p>Non-custodial Saas includes services like <a href=\"https://www.kiln.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Kiln</a> and <a href=\"https://stake.fish/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Stakefish</a>. Users deposit their ETH with the provider who then runs the node for them. The node will have its own signing keys and allows the user to have their own, private fund keys which allow them to move funds in and out of the node. In this way, users will have more control over their funds but as determined by the staking provider.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-7\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Utilizing a provider requires trust and verifying their system’s behavior. Vetting a SaaS provider means determining how much of their operation is programmatic and transparent and also measuring their operational history against their operational risk management practices.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency Allows Trust</strong>: black-box SaaS providers have no ability to convince users of their practices and guarantees.\n<ul>\n<li>What parts of the system are open source? audited? bug bounties?</li>\n<li>How are critical components like keys and funds handled?</li>\n<li>What fees do they charge? How is this verifiable?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Best Practices Are Best</strong>: providers that have plans for mitigating the operational issues above demonstrate competence. Look for providers that are open and proactive at describing the risks within their systems and how they handle them.\n<ul>\n<li>How long has the provider been operating?</li>\n<li>How much have they experienced penalties over their operation? What for? Have they ever been slashed?</li>\n<li>Do they describe mitigations to the operational risks described above?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Keep Things Permissionless</strong>: if a system is permissionless to enter and exit, then malicious operators and regulatory regimes cannot interfere with user funds.\n<ul>\n<li>Is it permissionless to join?</li>\n<li>Is there a regulatory regime that affects the provider? Does it require Know-Your-Customer information to join?</li>\n<li>What keys are required to be handed over? Are there separate keys for signing and moving funds?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Good vetting goes a long way but ultimately SaaS requires trust. Diversification among many different, qualified providers could protect a user from concentrated bad effects if there are enough trusted providers to be found.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"pooled-staking-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#pooled-staking-8\"></a>Pooled Staking</h3>\n<p>Pooled staking is when users deposit their funds together for a node operator to utilize and share staking rewards. Pools that are largely managed on-chain are the most common and provide smart contracts for users to manage their participation. Less common are SaaS-like pools where fund management and rewards are handled off-chain to some degree. By far the most common on-chain solution is for pools to provide ERC20-compliant liquid staking tokens (LSTs) for user deposits. This provides a unique opportunity for users. First, it’s incredibly convenient. A simple deposit is often enough to begin. And second, these pools allow users to stake but then re-deploy their LSTs to other financial purposes. In this way, users can stake and then gain further returns on their capital. Posting these tokens as collateral for more ETH and then repeating the staking process is not uncommon and allows users to create leveraged, staked positions but exposes them to the risks of market prices moving drastically against them and swallowing their initial staking capital. Examples of staking pools include <a href=\"https://rocketpool.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Rocket Pool</a> and of course <a href=\"https://lido.fi/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido</a> which is the single largest staked ETH holder.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-9\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Staking pools have similar risks to SaaS providers but must also handle commingled funds across possibly multiple node operators. As mentioned above, Lido is the giant in this space and its operation is handled by the <a href=\"https://lido.fi/governance\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido DAO</a>. So responsible users of the protocol should keep themselves apprised of the DAO’s initiatives and votes. Also, the systemic concerns begin appearing here as well. <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lido has been criticized</a> for not doing enough to counter its <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x10abedcc563b66b1adee60825e78c387105110fa4a1e7354ab57bc9cc1e675c2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">profit-seeking motivation</a> and the power of the market incentives for cartel-like behavior cannot be dismissed. Lastly and perhaps most difficult to measure, the ability of users to easily create large leveraged positions could create a catastrophic financial contagion scenario in the face of a large transaction or price movement.

They can be oracles, bridges, cryptography schemes, etc. An example of a restaking protocol is <a href=\"https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Eigenlayer</a> and examples of AVSs are <a href=\"https://www.lagrange.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lagrange</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gasp.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Gasp</a>. Usually, restaking providers give ERC20-compliant liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) for deposits and these have similar risks to LSTs in the market. This is a relatively newer service and does have slightly higher returns than the above options but at higher risk of losing funds due to the added complexity of running these services. These are much more complicated than liquid staking pools and are utilized by many to lever up a position and get the highest possible return from a staking-based strategy. Leverage among LRTs, like leverage of LSTs, complicates markets in ways that are difficult to quantify and investigate.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"key-considerations-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-11\"></a>Key Considerations</h4>\n<p>Restaking has all the complexity of liquid staking pools and then more. Restaking’s complexity and the less-developed markets for their tokens create serious risks that may not be worth it for an investor like Arbitrum DAO where safety of the funds is prioritized.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"considerations-for-the-dao-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#considerations-for-the-dao-12\"></a>Considerations for the DAO</h2>\n<p>All of the above describe staking risks but not their prevalence. As staking operations and markets become more mature, these risks become less and less likely. So how should the DAO proceed?</p>\n<h3><a name=\"determining-a-strategy-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#determining-a-strategy-13\"></a>Determining a Strategy</h3>\n<p>In the future, when issues arise and theses no longer hold true, having a written-down investment plan helps justify the path taken and determine what will need to be done next. The DAO should commit to defining:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What their staking and investment goals are</li>\n<li>What is the timeframe of their staking/investing</li>\n<li>Of the risks described above, what are they willing to take on and how much</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we’ve seen from discussions, the staking goals of the DAO appear to be to protect against ETH inflation, to generate revenue from the ETH reserves they hold, and to do all of this as safely as possible. Whether the DAO has specific, future liabilities they are working towards, we are not aware but these should be part of the investment plan if they exist. The time frame appears to be indefinite, i.e. it seems that this may be a permanent use of the ETH reserves. As for risks, the DAO should determine what risks it likes and what it doesn’t.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"risk-assessment-and-diversification-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#risk-assessment-and-diversification-14\"></a>Risk Assessment and Diversification</h3>\n<p>Let’s start a risk assessment by stating that individual staking may be operationally infeasible for a DAO to run. Multi-sigs, payment agreements, and all sorts of logistics can be set up, but the DAO would ultimately have to trust someone to handle the hardware, software, and funds correctly. So all the set up work is effectively the same as staking via with a SaaS provider but with extra, time-intensive steps to begin. This means that there is no option where the DAO stakes without trusting <em>someone</em>. Put another way, to stake the DAO will have to reasonably trust another party with their funds.</p>\n<p>We also do not go into much detail about Restaking and risks and leave it to the DAO to make that determination if they so choose. LRTs are easier to depeg and markets are harder to analyze therefore we’d recommend the DAO consider LSTs and build experience in these services before considering LRTs.</p>\n<p>This leaves SaaS and Staking Pools. From an operational risk and security perspective, there are SaaS providers and Staking Pools with histories of security and good practices. Each will need to be vetted as described above but the general difference between the two are the market forces that act on pools’ liquid staking tokens. Whether to accept market risks is for the DAO to decide. But having worked in the DeFi space, we see that good investment practice is to document the LST’s market forces, the possible blind spots, the market history, have a plan of action that is ready and easy to implement in case certain conditions arise, visit the assumptions and theses of the plan regularly, and to change the plan if the DAOs understanding of things changes.</p>\n<p>To protect itself from catastrophic, operational failure, OpenZeppelin will vet the security and posture of the different options the DAO considers. The DAO could also split its staked ETH across different options, limiting the max amount they can lose in the worst case scenario. The DAO can also consider slowly staking its ETH over time as it grows comfortable with the different options and strategy as a whole.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"strategy-execution-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#strategy-execution-15\"></a>Strategy Execution</h3>\n<p>A DAO treasury management protocol like <a href=\"https://docs.aera.finance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Aera</a> can be used for securing a diverse portfolio of assets, not limited to the recommended LSTs, with programmatically constrained active management.  A solution like this allows the DAO to remain in control of treasury funds and respond to market conditions faster than a governance vote.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"links-and-references-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#links-and-references-16\"></a>Links and References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2982\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2982</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/staking/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ethereum.org/en/staking/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.md</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guides\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guides</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4840805\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4840805</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/attack-and-defense/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/restaking-101-what-are-restaking-and-liquid-restaking/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.coindesk.com/learn/restaking-101-what-are-restaking-and-liquid-restaking/</a></li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/eth-staking-options-and-risks-for-the-dao/25762\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/eth-staking-options-and-risks-for-the-dao/25762","pubDate":"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 17:36:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25762"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/eth-staking-options-and-risks-for-the-dao/25762.rss","#text":"ETH Staking Options and Risks for the DAO"},"filter":false},{"title":"Event Horizon Franchiser Contract Audit","dc:creator":"openzeppelin","category":"Security Member","description":"<h2><a name=\"audit-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#audit-summary-1\"></a>Audit Summary</h2>\n<p>Type:   Governance</p>\n<p>Timeline:   From 2024-07-01 To 2024-07-05</p>\n<p>Languages:   Solidity</p>\n<p>Total Issues:   6 (1 resolved)</p>\n<p>Notes &amp; Additional Information:   6 (1 resolved)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"scope-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#scope-2\"></a>Scope</h2>\n<p>We audited the <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">HVAX/arbfranchiser repository</a> at <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser/tree/8caba3d84bb53d1695bfefcf1a99476ef892333e\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commit 8caba3d</a>.</p>\n<p>In scope were the following files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">src\n├── FranchiserFactory.sol\n├── Franchiser.sol\n├── FranchiserLens.sol\n├── base\n│   └── FranchiserImmutableState.sol\n└── interfaces\n    ├── IVotingToken.sol\n    ├── IFranchiserLens.sol\n    ├── IFranchiserImmutableState.sol\n    ├── Franchiser\n    │   ├── IFranchiser.sol\n    │   ├── IFranchiserErrors.sol\n    │   └── IFranchiserEvents.sol\n    └── FranchiserFactory\n        ├── IFranchiserFactory.sol\n        └── IFranchiserFactoryErrors.sol\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The audit only reviewed the smart contract components intended to be deployed on-chain.

This is an EOA that the <a href=\"https://eventhorizon.vote/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Event Horizon (EH) organization</a> will use to represent the voters from their platform. ARB users can only delegate their entire voting power to another address. So, in order to delegate a specific amount, a contract has been created that will have the amount transferred to it and then delegate its voting power to EH.</p>\n<p>The contract that EH provided to do this is a <a href=\"https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fork of a contract that was developed for Uniswap</a>. It was privately audited by Trail of Bits and has a lot of functionality beyond the minimum needs of the ARB DAO. The top-level contract which the DAO will interact with is the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract. It is built to allow anyone to delegate their <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/05f218fb6617932e56bf5388c3b389c3028a7b73/contracts/governance/utils/IVotes.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20 voting token</a>, like ARB, to a delegatee. It does this by creating a <code>Franchiser</code> contract underneath that would mark the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> as the owner, hold the $ARB tokens from the caller, and call <code>delegate</code> on the token to transfer the voting power to the specified user (e.g., the EH EOA).</p>\n<p>When the DAO is ready to take back the funds, a call to <code>recall</code> will pull the tokens out of the <code>Franchiser</code> and return them. There are added methods to batch delegation and recalling which we do not anticipate the DAO will need in this specific case but could use if more delegations of this sort arise. The <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract will create a <code>Franchiser</code> contract as needed for each unique delegator/delegatee pair, while each <code>Franchiser</code> is set up as a <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Clones\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">minimal proxy</a> of a Franchiser implementation contract.</p>\n<p>Each <code>Franchiser</code> contract has to ability for the delegatee to subdelegate their delegated tokens to further subdelegatees. This creates a tree of <code>Franchise</code> contracts with the original delegator/delegatee Franchise contract at the head, each subdelegation from a delegatee at each child node, and the tokens being transferred down the tree to imbue voting power. The original delegatee can sub-delegate up to eight times with each of these sub-delegating up to four, then two, then one. Counting the maximum possible nodes in each level of the tree totals to <code>(1) + (8) + (8 * 4) + (8 * 4 * 2) + (8 * 4 * 2) = 169</code> nodes. At each Franchiser contract in this tree, the delegatee can unsubdelegate and return all of the funds transferred down the tree to their own contract and restore their full voting power delegation. The <code>recall</code> method mentioned above does the same thing but returns all tokens from the tree to the original delegator.</p>\n<p>The scope also includes an optional <code>FranchiserLens</code> contract which contains <code>view</code> functions to get data from the Franchiser tree in flat formats. It is not necessary for the other contracts in scope but would give the DAO easy visibility into their delegation and any further subdeldegations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-model-and-trust-assumptions-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#security-model-and-trust-assumptions-4\"></a>Security Model and Trust Assumptions</h2>\n<p>This code relies on the <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenZeppelin Contracts library</a> for cloning, checking for code size, and for set operations.

If the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract is to be used solely for this one EH delegation, it is possible to change the <code>INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES</code> to one and make further subdelegations by EH impossible. This would ensure that they do not have the ability to further subdelegate to another actor who is not in the proposal but would make vote splitting by subdelegation impossible by EH (at least until <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387\">fractional voting is brought to the governor</a>).</p>\n<p>Of course, by delegating in the first place, the DAO is already trusting EH to behave as promised. Thus, further subdelegations being used maliciously to vote in other ways appears to be a minor risk that is mitigated by the ability to revoke the funds. However, revoking is a slow process that would require a vote to pass as the L2 Governor would be the original delegator. A way around it would be to transfer the funds directly to the security council and entrust them to create the subdelegation from the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract. We are not aware, however, of a precedent or authority for the council to behave this way.</p>\n<p>Possible ways to improve the code and tailor it specifically to Arbitrum’s needs would be to give the non-emergency security council the ability to recall the funds. This can be done by allowing the council to be specified at initial delegation and adding an ability for them to call the <code>recall</code> function. However, even then, a call to <code>recall</code> (even <code>unSubDelegate</code>) could be front-run to get in a last vote before losing voting power. A fix for this could be to add some sort of authorization method for the delegatee to vote only on approved votes, but this seems overly protective and operationally taxing to implement. No matter what the community chooses or how the contract iterates, we will review any on-chain proposal for construction/delegation and opine on its safety and features.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Resolved in <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser/blob/101d01da9b6ca33bf3e9ad1bf12841fc96e5ab8a/src/FranchiserFactory.sol#L18\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commit 101d01d</a>.</em></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-12\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This audit covered the Franchiser contracts provided by Event Horizon. They will allow the Arbitrum DAO to transfer a token through the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> to a <code>Franchiser</code> contract which will delegate its voting power to Event Horizon, allowing them to vote on proposals. The <code>Franchiser</code> contract, as audited, allows Event Horizon to further subdelegate their tokens.

This is an EOA that the <a href=\"https://eventhorizon.vote/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Event Horizon (EH) organization</a> will use to represent the voters from their platform. ARB users can only delegate their entire voting power to another address. So, in order to delegate a specific amount, a contract has been created that will have the amount transferred to it and then delegate its voting power to EH.</p>\n<p>The contract that EH provided to do this is a <a href=\"https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">fork of a contract that was developed for Uniswap</a>. It was privately audited by Trail of Bits and has a lot of functionality beyond the minimum needs of the ARB DAO. The top-level contract which the DAO will interact with is the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract. It is built to allow anyone to delegate their <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/05f218fb6617932e56bf5388c3b389c3028a7b73/contracts/governance/utils/IVotes.sol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-20 voting token</a>, like ARB, to a delegatee. It does this by creating a <code>Franchiser</code> contract underneath that would mark the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> as the owner, hold the $ARB tokens from the caller, and call <code>delegate</code> on the token to transfer the voting power to the specified user (e.g., the EH EOA).</p>\n<p>When the DAO is ready to take back the funds, a call to <code>recall</code> will pull the tokens out of the <code>Franchiser</code> and return them. There are added methods to batch delegation and recalling which we do not anticipate the DAO will need in this specific case but could use if more delegations of this sort arise. The <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract will create a <code>Franchiser</code> contract as needed for each unique delegator/delegatee pair, while each <code>Franchiser</code> is set up as a <a href=\"https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Clones\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">minimal proxy</a> of a Franchiser implementation contract.</p>\n<p>Each <code>Franchiser</code> contract has to ability for the delegatee to subdelegate their delegated tokens to further subdelegatees. This creates a tree of <code>Franchise</code> contracts with the original delegator/delegatee Franchise contract at the head, each subdelegation from a delegatee at each child node, and the tokens being transferred down the tree to imbue voting power. The original delegatee can sub-delegate up to eight times with each of these sub-delegating up to four, then two, then one. Counting the maximum possible nodes in each level of the tree totals to $<code>(1)+(8)+(8 \\cdot 4)+(8 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2)+(8 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2) = 169</code>$ nodes. At each Franchiser contract in this tree, the delegatee can unsubdelegate and return all of the funds transferred down the tree to their own contract and restore their full voting power delegation. The <code>recall</code> method mentioned above does the same thing but returns all tokens from the tree to the original delegator.</p>\n<p>The scope also includes an optional <code>FranchiserLens</code> contract which contains <code>view</code> functions to get data from the Franchiser tree in flat formats. It is not necessary for the other contracts in scope but would give the DAO easy visibility into their delegation and any further subdeldegations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"security-model-and-trust-assumptions-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#security-model-and-trust-assumptions-5\"></a>Security Model and Trust Assumptions</h2>\n<p>This code relies on the <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenZeppelin Contracts library</a> for cloning, checking for code size, and for set operations.

If the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract is to be used solely for this one EH delegation, it is possible to change the <code>INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES</code> to one and make further subdelegations by EH impossible. This would ensure that they do not have the ability to further subdelegate to another actor who is not in the proposal but would make vote splitting by subdelegation impossible by EH (at least until <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387\">fractional voting is brought to the governor</a>).</p>\n<p>Of course, by delegating in the first place, the DAO is already trusting EH to behave as promised. Thus, further subdelegations being used maliciously to vote in other ways appears to be a minor risk that is mitigated by the ability to revoke the funds. However, revoking is a slow process that would require a vote to pass as the L2 Governor would be the original delegator. A way around it would be to transfer the funds directly to the security council and entrust them to create the subdelegation from the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> contract. We are not aware, however, of a precedent or authority for the council to behave this way.</p>\n<p>Possible ways to improve the code and tailor it specifically to Arbitrum’s needs would be to give the non-emergency security council the ability to recall the funds. This can be done by allowing the council to be specified at initial delegation and adding an ability for them to call the <code>recall</code> function. However, even then, a call to <code>recall</code> (even <code>unSubDelegate</code>) could be front-run to get in a last vote before losing voting power. A fix for this could be to add some sort of authorization method for the delegatee to vote only on approved votes, but this seems overly protective and operationally taxing to implement. No matter what the community chooses or how the contract iterates, we will review any on-chain proposal for construction/delegation and opine on its safety and features.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Resolved in <a href=\"https://github.com/HVAX/arbfranchiser/blob/101d01da9b6ca33bf3e9ad1bf12841fc96e5ab8a/src/FranchiserFactory.sol#L18\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commit 101d01d</a>.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#conclusion-13\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This audit covered the Franchiser contracts provided by Event Horizon. They will allow the Arbitrum DAO to transfer a token through the <code>FranchiserFactory</code> to a <code>Franchiser</code> contract which will delegate it’s voting power to Event Horizon, allowing them to vote in proposals. The <code>Franchiser</code> contract as audited allows Event Horizon to further subdelegate their tokens. If the DAO is not interested in using this contract for further grants, we recommend the DAO remove this subdelegation ability from the contracts by setting the <code>INITIAL_MAXIMUM_SUBDELEGATEES</code> constant to one. We also found no security issues with the contracts and our notes contain only recommendations for coding practices. We welcome iteration on the contracts and will be auditing any changes and on-chain proposals involving them. We are grateful to the Event Horizon team for being responsive during the audit and for bringing a compelling use case to the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-arbitrum-franchiser-audit/25702\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-arbitrum-franchiser-audit/25702","pubDate":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 17:37:13 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-25702"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-arbitrum-franchiser-audit/25702.rss","#text":"Event Horizon Arbitrum Franchiser Audit"},"filter":false},{"title":"Fractal ID Hack - Call for New KYC/KYB Service Provider Nominations","dc:creator":"mcfly","category":"General","description":"<p>Dear Arbitrum DAO community,</p>\n<p>On July 14th, Fractal ID experienced a major data breach.

Even more important than decentralisation is openness - the degree to which an ecosystem allows for outside-in innovation.</p>\n<p>Decentralisation prevents capture by a small group of participants, but a capture-resistant ecosystem can still die through disruption and being outcompeted. Survival is directly dependent on our ability to adapt and improve, to understand the needs of users, talent, investors, etc. and to provide outstanding solutions. Said otherwise, the key for survival is being able to innovate in how we solve people’s problems.</p>\n<p>Being at the forefront of innovation is a tricky thing. By definition, innovative solutions are not commonly known and understood. Innovation can not be fully planned, it can only be supported and encouraged.</p>\n<p>Critically, because innovative ideas can come from all kinds of places, as an ecosystem, it’s key to be welcoming to innovations that originated somewhere else. Corporations have learnt this lesson the hard way and now commonly fund a trifecta of accelerators, VC funds, and M&amp;A to facilitate outside-in innovation. However, despite these strategies providing some defences to disruption,<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1259275/average-company-lifespan/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20average%20lifespan,even%20further%20throughout%20the%202020s.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> the lifespan of corporations keeps decreasing</a>. More needs to be done!</p>\n<p>For an organisation designer like myself, DAOs are exciting because they promise both capture resistance AND a radical upgrade in our ability to incorporate outside-in innovation. Instead of problems being discussed behind closed doors, DAOs can employ open communication platforms. Instead of rejecting anything ‘not invented here’, DAOs can celebrate experimentation. Instead of falling for the shorter-mist allure of cost-cutting and reducing redundancy, DAOs can decentralise operations and experiment with a variety of methods. In sum, DAOs can transform organisations from closed to open, leading to better outcomes for users, contributors, and investors.</p>\n<p>DAOs could do that but right now that’s far from certain. The allure of centralisation is strong. Innovation compounds over time but it’s hard to measure in the early stages. When appropriate methodologies and assessment frameworks are not in place, cost-cutting (disguised as efficiency) quickly kills anything hard to quantify or explain.</p>\n<p>This is not a new problem, a range of methodologies and tools for what’s called open innovation has been slowly maturing. <a href=\"https://rndao.mirror.xyz/TxGTNemp_c4uNeWGiubJbC3akaNfJIJYcbgQZrHLK10\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Our research shows</a> that sense-making (being able to identify and prioritise challenges and root causes) is the critical first step. We now understand that access to information and being able to search through weak signals is key for outsiders to be able to propose innovations. And we know that offering quick access to funding for small experiments is critical for anything innovative to ever be tested.</p>\n<p>The lack of tools and methodologies for open innovation (or lack of awareness that they even exist), leads many to conclude that only closed-door meetings are effective. <a href=\"https://x.com/_Daniel_Ospina/status/1810670977174417918\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">As Disruption Joe eloquently said</a>, DAOs suffer through a common pattern of decentralising (poorly), then worrying about execution, centralising, and finally stagnating. Let’s avoid this faith; let’s avoid the false dichotomy of centralisation and decentralisation; let’s welcome outside-in innovation. Let’s build open organisations!</p>\n<p>We’re exploring this territory through RnDAO, and we want to work with Arbitrum to make the DAO more open and innovative:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sense-making capability: <a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd096c5d610d4455bcae4bff719d18345939c5d6b20d56c6a1f37d0247ad10f71\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Jumpstart Fund proposal</a> (now in Snapshot) and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site/25660\">Off-Site proposal</a> (in forum)</li>\n<li>access to information: Proposal coming soon, let us know if you want to get involved early!</li>\n<li>quick access to fund experiments: some mechanisms already in place through Questbook tracks.

Initially, the community was hesitant to sell ARB tokens, resulting in the decision not to convert them. As a result, the remaining funds are insufficient to cover the planned six-month term. The ARDC is requesting an additional 1,200,000 ARB to support operations through August and September, ensuring they can fulfill their mandate. Any surplus funds will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> - The Proposal aims to ensure that the ArbitrumDAO satisfies its payment obligations to ARDC members that were duly elected by the ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong> - The proposal will move to a Snapshot vote on the 25th of july.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong> - 1,200,000ARB</p>\n<h1><a name=\"request-for-additional-funding-for-the-ardc-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#request-for-additional-funding-for-the-ardc-1\"></a>Request for Additional Funding for the ARDC</h1>\n<p>[1] Background</p>\n<p>Following the establishment of the Arbitrum Research &amp; Development Collective (‘ARDC’) for an initial 6-month term, we have encountered challenges due to the price fluctuation of ARB tokens. In the proposal passed on <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/56002054155248055908873103086558103132748843103210580613728556162036150296506\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tally</a> and executed on 25-Jan-2024, 1.76M ARB was transferred to the multi-sig wallet worth approximately $3.06M USD at the time (with ARB priced at around $1.74). Currently, the price of ARB is approximately $0.75, resulting in a significant reduction in the purchasing power of ARB, now valued at less than half its original amount.</p>\n<p>At the time, there was community hesitance in relation to OTC’ing the ARB supplied to the ARDC. Hence, this was not done to respect the community sentiment at the time.</p>\n<p>ARDC Members currently get remunerated accordingly as per their election that was held via Snapshot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delphi [72k Worth of ARB/month];</li>\n<li>Blockworks [72K Worth of ARB/month];</li>\n<li>Chaos Labs [53,333 Worth of ARB/month];</li>\n<li>L2Beat [50k ARB for the entire term, in monthly tranches];</li>\n<li>OpenZeppelin [125,000 Worth of ARB /month].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to this volatility, the 1.76M ARB is insufficient to fund the ARDC for its full 6-month term. Currently, the multi-sig wallet holds 163.32k ARB priced at $124,000. To address this, we propose an injection of over and above the original amount requested, which will help fund the ARDC through August and September. This additional funding will enable the ARDC to fully execute its program as originally intended.</p>\n<p>Any excess ARB which will not be utilised will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury.</p>\n<p>[2] Proposal Details:</p>\n<p>Additional Funding Request: We request an additional 1,200,000 ARB to supplement the existing funds used to support the ARDC.</p>\n<p>Return of Surplus Funds: Any surplus funds remaining after the completion of the ARDC’s term will be returned to the DAO.</p>\n<p>[3] Conclusion:</p>\n<p>The ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By providing additional funding to the ARDC to compensate for the negative price movement of the ARB token, the ARDC will be able to fulfil its initial mandate as originally intended.</p>\n

We are pleased to see a sustained increase in this metric.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This graph only includes Communication Rationales. We decided not to count high-impact comments as there are cases where the voting rationale is communicated along with a valuable contribution to the proposal. If we included these high-impact comments, the percentage of Collected Comments would be even higher.</em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"final-conclusions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#final-conclusions-15\"></a>Final Conclusions</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum DAO Delegate Incentive Program has proven effective in increasing both participation and the quality of discussions within the community. The data reflects <em><strong>significant growth</strong></em> in the number of proposals and delegate participation. This comes in a context where activity in Arbitrum DAO has been high, averaging nine proposals per month, even excluding proposals related to the various incentive programs approved by the DAO.</p>\n<p>We observed that the <strong>participation rate of VP from delegates in the program increased by 12% on Snapshot and 13% on Tally during the three months the program has been active</strong>, compared to the three months prior. However, it is important to note that the <strong>average Voting Power on Tally has decreased</strong>. While most voters fall within the lower VP ranges, the data indicates that the majority of VP is concentrated in a small number of addresses, which are crucial for achieving quorum.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Delegates who participated in the program showed a high rate of participation in voting and forum contributions</strong></em>. The number of collected comments and participation in forum discussions increased significantly, demonstrating greater engagement from incentivized delegates. <strong>It’s encouraging to see the quantity of discussions rise in the forum.</strong> While there is still room for improvement, we believe we are on the right track.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 5 participants</small></p>\n

The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured off-site event will be organized right before <a href=\"https://devcon.org/en/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DevCon Thailand</a>, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.</p>\n<p>This proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to identify the most important agenda items to be discussed at the off-site, ensuring the IRL meeting is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The off-site will then include professional facilitation and a distraction-free environment to advance alignment, remove blockers, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.</p>\n<p>The success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively on the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-problem-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-problem-3\"></a>The Problem</h2>\n<p>The DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.</p>\n<p>Areas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-solution-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposed-solution-4\"></a>Proposed Solution</h2>\n<p>Recent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for IRL events to catalyse progress. We want to build on these learnings and prepare thoroughly to leverage the next big Web3 event (DevCon in Thailand) to advance ArbitrumDAO.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Agenda prioritisation</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Project manager to engage with delegates and key stakeholders, distilling concerns and topic suggestions, and facilitate converging on the agenda.</li>\n<li>Careful planning of each session: aiming to share and agree on frameworks and approaches in advance, focusing IRL discussion on content and not format.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Off-site Event Organization:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>2 full-day event, with the option to participate only one day if needed by some attendees.</li>\n<li>Distraction-free environment (arranged catering and accommodation, separate from other events).</li>\n<li>Focused sessions on key agreed topic(s).</li>\n<li>Professional facilitation for key sessions</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Attendees:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on high-context, expert, and senior participants.

As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the meeting is effective.</p>\n<p>RnDAO can either provide facilitation (we’ve facilitated strategy and org design workshops for years) or we can hire an external facilitator. The tradeoff is high context and full neutrality (as participants of the DAO we’re biased, and although any good facilitator will try to remain neutral, there are still tradeoffs and decisions to be made in moderating conversations).<br>\nAs such, we’ll ask in the Snapshot vote whether the delegates trust us to be the facilitator or would rather have us hire an external facilitator.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"hybrid-participation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#hybrid-participation-8\"></a>Hybrid participation</h2>\n<p>We’ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost $100-$600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties. The online setup is of course less good than being IRL but it is still viable to contribute to sessions (anyone leading a session does need to be IRL but, for input in the discussion, online works).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-9\"></a>Timeline:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>August-September: proposal approval and then logistics planning and preparation (including collecting RSVPs for venue scouting).</li>\n<li>October: Agenda and sessions planning (agenda freeze by November 3rd).

Balancer is happy to continue expanding options for our user’s and Arbitrums to earn yield on stable coins.
