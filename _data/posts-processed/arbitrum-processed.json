In this executive summary, we’ll examine the evidence and discuss some highlights.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-1-liquidity-incentives-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-1-liquidity-incentives-2\"></a>1. Liquidity Incentives</h3>\n<p>Liquidity Incentives were distributed to all the GM liquidity pools of GMX V2 on Arbitrum, to encourage capital inflows.</p>\n<p>The main results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GMX v2 experienced an unprecedented surge in Total Value Locked (TVL). Within a remarkably short timeframe, TVL rapidly grew from $80 million to a peak of over $400 million.</li>\n<li>GM Pools allowed Liquidity Providers to have more granular control over their liquidity provision compared to GMX v1 (the multi-asset GLP pool). Since the introduction of GM Pools, the best-performing markets were SOL/USD, XRP/USD, and ARB/USD, which outperformed their standard DEX AMM pool benchmarks by 37.31%, 23.53%, and 20.78%, respectively. Additionally, the average performance across all GM liquidity pools was 15.64%, highlighting their capital efficiency and robust performance.</li>\n<li>The liquidity incentives program successfully attracted significant liquidity to the protocol. As a result, GMX v2 experienced improved market depth and stability, enhancing the overall user experience for traders. A week after incentives concluded, V2 still enjoys a TVL of $290M: more than 360% growth from its baseline of $80M.</li>\n<li>New GM Pools were introduced for 6 assets: AAVE, NEAR, BNB, OP, AVAX, and ATOM. This broadened the range of markets available to traders and Arbitrum ecosystem partners to build on.</li>\n<li>DeFi users bridged $98 Million into Arbitrum across these newly available assets (SOL, AVAX, WBNB, OP), thereby boosting Arbitrum’s goal of being the premier asset layer within Ethereum DeFi.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"h-2-trading-incentives-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-2-trading-incentives-3\"></a>2. Trading Incentives</h3>\n<p>Trading Incentives, in the form of fee rebates, were offered to all traders on the GMX V2 markets. The goal was to encourage engagement with GMX v2 on Arbitrum and to stimulate CEX traders to experiment with trading crypto non-custodially on-chain.</p>\n<p>The main results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over its eight months of existence, GMX v2 has generated a total trading volume of $34.38B. From the start of the STIP campaign (in the second week of November), v2 trading volume shows a clear upward trend.</li>\n<li>March was the most successful overall month, with the STIP incentives boosting GMX v2 trading volume up to $7.74B, and $14.52M in protocol fees collected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During the entire STIP incentives campaign, GMX accumulated over $29.72B in volume and generated $27.10M in fees. This was the highest fee generation across all perpetual DEXes, demonstrating the demand among traders and the product-market fit of v2.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-grants-program-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-3-grants-program-4\"></a>3. Grants Program</h3>\n<p>A portion of the STIP grant was dedicated to supporting projects built on the GMX v2 platform, fostering innovation and development within the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The main results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GMX funded 22 applications out of 54 funding applicants, with 1,673,500 ARB allocated to the grantees. Based on their achieved milestones, ~1,290,000 ARB was ultimately distributed to the grantees.</li>\n<li>Our grantees generated close to 518 million in trading volume on GMX v2 and achieved a combined TVL of 40 million on their platforms, contributing to increasingly liquid on-chain markets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the evidence suggests that GMX’s use of the Arbitrum DAO STIP grant has been a success. The allocated funds were effectively deployed, achieving the overarching objective: driving significant on-chain engagement with DeFi on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The liquidity and trading incentives programs have driven growth and engagement on GMX v2, while the grants program has fostered the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>A more detailed report underpinning these conclusions is available below.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"full-report-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#full-report-5\"></a>Full Report</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"history-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#history-6\"></a>History</h2>\n<p>GMX is a decentralised spot and perpetual exchange where traders benefit from low fees, deep liquidity, reduced liquidation risks, and transparent pricing. Liquidity on GMX is user-contributed, and liquidity providers earn a large share of the fees the protocol generates from market making, swap fees, and leverage trading.</p>\n<p>GMX had applied for the<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gmx-final-stip-round-1/17426\"> STIP grants</a>, the<a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/92535731414466076465748260699234569033779695239254902723866669906112586724812?chart=list\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> first ecosystem incentive grants program for the Arbitrum DAO</a>, and presented a proposal to the DAO asking for 14 million ARB in grant funds. Based on the large number of grant requests, community response, and delegates’ feedback, the ask was subsequently lowered to 12 million ARB. After the proposal passed, we aimed to distribute 5 million ARB towards liquidity incentives, 5 million ARB towards trading incentives, and up to 2 million ARB towards grant incentives.</p>\n<p>This final report outlines the effectiveness of the STIP grant used by GMX towards the growth of GMX v2 through the incentive program. The program encompassed incentives for traders, liquidity providers, and grants within the protocol ecosystem. Through this initiative, GMX aimed to stimulate trader activity, enhance liquidity, encourage development within its ecosystem, and grow GMX v2. Additionally, this report provides an overview of the program’s objectives, implementation strategies, outcomes, successes, and recommendations for future iterations.</p>\n<p>GMX launched its incentive program on 8/11/23 with the following objectives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creating a diverse range of perpetual and spot pools that are highly liquid and capital-efficient. These pools, with liquidity provider tokens, will generate yields that are composable with other protocols.</li>\n<li>Converting CEX users to DEX users, reducing the trading fees on the decentralised perpetual exchange to a level comparable to the VIP tiers of leading centralised exchanges.</li>\n<li>Listing multiple token markets for traders to trade on GMX v2 on-chain without needing to custody their funds.</li>\n<li>Supporting builders with our grants program (mini-STIP) and promoting the development and integration of Arbitrum protocols on GMX V2.</li>\n<li>Providing seamless integration with popular wallets and ensuring a user-friendly experience for all participants.</li>\n<li>Continuing to build a vibrant and inclusive community of developers, traders, liquidity providers, and ecosystem projects that contribute to the overall growth and success of GMX v2</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"program-overview-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-overview-7\"></a>Program Overview</h2>\n<p>Grant Allocation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Liquidity Incentives</strong>: The liquidity incentives portion of the grant was directed towards incentivising liquidity providers to maintain deep liquidity on GMX’s trading markets. This was achieved through various mechanisms, assessing metrics like utilisation ratios, APR of pools, and other mechanisms to develop strategic ways to boost TVL, utilisation, and trader growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Trading Incentives</strong>: A significant portion of the grant was allocated to trading incentives aimed at encouraging active trading within the GMX v2 ecosystem. This involved implementing trading competitions, rewards for high trading volumes, and initiatives to enhance market utilisation.</li>\n<li><strong>Grant Incentives</strong>: A portion of the grant was dedicated to supporting projects and initiatives within the GMX ecosystem through grant programs. These grants were awarded to promising projects, teams, or individuals building on or contributing to the GMX v2 platform.

Following the infusion of 5 million ARB liquidity incentives, GMX v2 experienced an unprecedented surge in Total Value Locked (TVL). Within a remarkably short span, TVL skyrocketed from $80 million to a peak of $400 million, demonstrating the substantial impact of our efforts.</p>\n<p>With increased TVL, our protocol now offers deeper liquidity pools, reduced slippage, and enhanced trading opportunities for Arbitrum users, thereby encouraging a more vibrant and efficient ecosystem. This surge underscores the impact of our liquidity incentives in attracting and retaining liquidity providers (LPs) within our ecosystem. Moreover, through migration incentives and community engagement, we were able to effectively migrate liquidity providers (LPs) from our previous GLP pools to our new GM pools, promoting deeper liquidity and enhancing the overall resilience of our ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Not only has this injection of liquidity strengthened our protocol’s market presence and resilience, but it has also facilitated increased participation from users seeking to capitalise on the yield opportunities of the GM pools. This growth signifies the confidence of investors and LPs in our protocol and underlines the importance of incentives in these challenging, competitive markets. We remain committed to further advancing the growth of GMX and the Arbitrum DeFi landscape, powered by innovative solutions and community-driven initiatives.</p>\n<p>The liquidity incentives were initially intended to scale up as TVL grew, but with the extension of STIP over a longer period, we implemented a taper strategy. Additional ARB was allocated to newly launched markets like BNB, AVAX, ATOM, NEAR, OP and AAVE that were deployed on GMX v2.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/2/2a8c29e59570db19a0a53ac76247b5421e35c029.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/64olSZasZ32fGSifbKStNqBtgZX.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2a8c29e59570db19a0a53ac76247b5421e35c029_2_624x455.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"64olSZasZ32fGSifbKStNqBtgZX\" width=\"624\" height=\"455\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2a8c29e59570db19a0a53ac76247b5421e35c029_2_624x455.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2a8c29e59570db19a0a53ac76247b5421e35c029_2_936x682.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2a8c29e59570db19a0a53ac76247b5421e35c029_2_1248x910.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"EBDCEC\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<p>In the process, GMX facilitated the arrival of new DeFi assets on Arbitrum.

So, we decided to launch a trading competition to celebrate the launch of GMX’s new Trading Leaderboard, which coincided with the introduction of EIP-4844 and ArbOS ATLAS (which vastly reduced gas fees on Layer 2s like Arbitrum).<br>\nBy leveraging the trading contest alongside CEX wallet campaigns, we aimed to showcase the highly optimised post-EIP-4844 trading environment and encourage greater experimentation, attracting new traders to Arbitrum. We therefore hosted the GMX <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#EIP4844</span> Trading Competition, with a prize pot of 280,000 ARB tokens available for the winners. All trades on GMX V2 on Arbitrum automatically qualified for the competition.</p>\n<p>The trading competition started on March 13, 2024, and consisted of two contest phases, each lasting for a week. The first trading contest commenced on March 13 and ended on March 20. The second trading competition began on March 20 and ended on March 27. During this period, users who traded on the platform and ranked on the leaderboard were eligible for a share of the competition’s prize pool.</p>\n<p>Engagement with the trading competition was further boosted through active promotion on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coingecko</a>, financed by GMX’s own marketing fund rather than STIP funds.</p>\n<p>The contest was divided into two categories:</p>\n<p>Top PnL ($):</p>\n<p>The Top PnL ($) prizes were awarded to the 1st-18th highest notional PnL ($), based on the total realised and unrealised profit and loss for the competition period, including fees and price impact.</p>\n<p>Top PnL (%):</p>\n<p>The Top PnL (%) prizes were awarded to the 1st-18th highest PnL according to percentage gains. In this case, PnL (%) is defined as [PnL / Capital Used].</p>\n<p>Every trader on the platform was eligible for both prize categories, and the prize breakdown was as follows:</p>\n<p>Prizes for Top PnL ($) Category:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st Highest Notional PnL: 50,000 ARB</li>\n<li>2nd Highest Notional PnL: 25,000 ARB</li>\n<li>3rd Highest Notional PnL: 10,000 ARB</li>\n<li>4th-18th Highest Notional PnL: 1,000 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TOTAL: 100,000 ARB * 2 weeks = 200,000 ARB</p>\n<p>Prizes for Top PnL (%) Category:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st Highest PnL (%): 10,000 ARB</li>\n<li>2nd Highest PnL (%): 7,000 ARB</li>\n<li>3rd Highest PnL (%): 5,000 ARB</li>\n<li>4th-18th Highest PnL (%): 1,200 ARB</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TOTAL: 40,000 ARB * 2 weeks = 80,000 ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Driving Growth through Trading Incentives</strong></p>\n<p>The introduction of trading incentives, through the allocation of 5 million ARB tokens, provided a notable boost to user growth within the GMX ecosystem, which had already been trending up. The protocol’s exceptional performance in fee collection within the Perp DEX sector further solidifies GMX’s position. The availability of trading incentives attracted new users plus encouraged existing users to increase their participation levels, resulting in a surge in trading volume and fees collected on GMX.</p>\n<p>Analysing the data, GMX Protocol has consistently outperformed its competitors in fee collection, surpassing all other Perp Dexes in the market. This achievement underscores GMX’s effectiveness in capturing value from the derivatives trading ecosystem. GMX’s achievement can partly be attributed to the implementation of the STIP trading incentives, designed to encourage increased trading volume and activity within the protocol. As you can see in the market screenshot below, after the incentives, GMX has collected the highest amount of protocol fees across all Perp Dexes.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8fb295ac5ef629d0a0b9659a8792cc00ac599d62.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/kvcTr6c9u7vdFnXMO6cUdvcwNqO.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fb295ac5ef629d0a0b9659a8792cc00ac599d62_2_624x271.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"kvcTr6c9u7vdFnXMO6cUdvcwNqO\" width=\"624\" height=\"271\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fb295ac5ef629d0a0b9659a8792cc00ac599d62_2_624x271.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fb295ac5ef629d0a0b9659a8792cc00ac599d62_2_936x406.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8fb295ac5ef629d0a0b9659a8792cc00ac599d62_2_1248x542.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"3E4753\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"h-3-grant-incentives-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#h-3-grant-incentives-12\"></a>3.) Grant Incentives</h3>\n<h3><a name=\"the-objective-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-objective-13\"></a>The Objective</h3>\n<p>The main aim of the grant initiative was to encourage the growth of the broader, composable GMX V2 ecosystem, by offering development assistance through grant incentives. This would, by extension, increase liquidity and trading on GMX while boosting the Arbitrum DeFi sector. The support was targeted towards wallets, Telegram bots, projects integrating with GMX V2’s GM Pools, and emerging protocols that meet specific requirements and provide maximum safety and security for users.</p>\n<p>Our goal with the integrations was to distribute incentives to users who utilise GMX V2 contracts through these integrations in a manner that fits these objectives. These users will receive incentives for providing liquidity, engaging in trading activities, and contributing to the extension of GMX’s features.</p>\n<p>The grants program has been instrumental in attracting new talent into the ecosystem and realising innovative ideas. The financial support, combined with the opportunity to contribute to GMX’s growth, has drawn numerous applicants from different backgrounds, thereby infusing the ecosystem with fresh insights and creative energy.</p>\n<p>The program’s impact extended from the immediate beneficiaries of the grants to increased activity within the GMX ecosystem, thereby contributing to the overall growth and robustness of GMX V2.</p>\n<p>GMX was committed to providing limited operational support to ensure the success of protocols building on top of GMX as a base layer. This approach reinforced the channel that connects GMX’s growth to that of the entire Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring mutual benefits and collaborative development.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-implementation-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-implementation-14\"></a>The Implementation</h3>\n<p>After much initial discussion among the GMX core contributors, and with concerns regarding the three-month timeline, we decided to adopt a committee-based model instead of a community one. This decision was made in light of the STIP timeline and to allow for faster implementation.</p>\n<p>We established a<a href=\"https://gov.gmx.io/t/formation-of-grants-committee/2493\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Grants Committee</a> for our grants program. The committee, as proposed, consisted of eight members. These members were a blend of core contributors, individuals from the community, and technical domain experts, all supported by a grant administrator coordinating the process. This diverse mix ensured a wide range of expert opinions on grant proposals. The committee comprises DeFi experts, technical developers, data scientists, and DeFi ecosystem and growth experts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KrBlueberr98752\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">KR_GMX</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/coinflipcanada\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Coinflipcanada</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jonas_ALA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Jonezee</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jr0gon\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Jrogon</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanoeth\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Tanoeth</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kalcrypto1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Kalcrypto</a>, and<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesCliffyz\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> Shogun</a>, as existing contributors to GMX, formed the initial grant committee members. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaurabhDhekale\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Saurabh</a> was appointed as a Grants Administrator based on his previous experience in the administration of grants programs.</p>\n<p>After setting up the process, we worked on creating the<a href=\"https://gov.gmx.io/t/how-to-apply-gmx-dao-grants/2512\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> grants template</a> and setting up the<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/57b96d777d814e9387f2d79cf4c3ea9f?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> landing page</a> to enable grantees to navigate the grants process easily. The grants template was also subsequently implemented in the LTIPP program. We divided the grants program into three categories:</p>\n<p>a) Open Grants - grants ranging from 10K ARB up to 100K ARB</p>\n<p>b) Micro grants - grants ranging from 1K ARB up to $10K ARB</p>\n<p>c) RFP’s</p>\n<p>We implemented rigorous monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track the grant recipients’ progress and ensure the funds were used efficiently and effectively. We also established precise reporting requirements for the grant recipients, requiring them to submit regular updates on their progress and use of funds. Through these mechanisms, we ensured that the grant funds were used in a manner that maximised their impact on the growth of the GMX V2 ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The KYC for the grants program was managed end-to-end by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-paolo-patti-68b475113?utm_source=share&amp;utm_campaign=share_via&amp;utm_content=profile&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BLG</a>, who performed the process for the applicants. GMX paid them 3637 ARB as a service fee.</p>\n<p>We used Gitcoin Grants Stack to provide the tooling to help the grants program run smoothly and decentralise the decision-making process.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"outcomes-and-impact-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#outcomes-and-impact-15\"></a>Outcomes and Impact</h3>\n<p>We kickstarted the grants program on November 8th and, after receiving exactly 54 applications in the span of one month, we sunsetted the grants program on December 13th. While the grants program was active, we accepted 21 applications from the 54 received. The proposals that the grants committee did not support, were subsequently assisted by GMX’s business development contributors so they could continue building on GMX and Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>The grants program attracted high-quality applications from a diverse range of projects and individuals, all aiming to contribute to the GMX ecosystem. After a thorough review process, we granted funds to 21 promising projects that demonstrated strong potential for advancing the ecosystem’s growth and innovation. We allocated around 1,673,500 ARB ARB to the grantees, and eventually disbursed close to 1,290,000 ARB.</p>\n<p>The impact of the GMX grants program has been substantial. The funded initiatives have not only led to direct improvements in the GMX V2 tooling but also contributed to increased community involvement and enthusiasm. The resultant increase in liquidity has made GMX V2 more attractive to traders and investors. The grants-based incentive program also encouraged crypto users to try out the platform, leading to an increase in the number of active traders and significant growth in TVL.</p>\n<p>In addition, the grant program has helped create accountability among the grantees, and a sense of community involvement and ownership. All the accepted grantees were required to<a href=\"https://gov.gmx.io/c/gmx-grants-report/8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> submit bi-weekly reports on the GMX governance forum</a>.</p>\n<p>Overall, the GMX grants initiative served as a strong foundation for innovation, development, and improvements within the GMX and Arbitrum ecosystems. As we move forward, we aim to build on this success by continually refining our ecosystem-focused approach, taking into account the valuable feedback and experiences garnered through the grants program.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/3569362/6007837\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/182279b61c5e0eacff35b2f0a99caec71183e02c.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"3rvjZXoeBcTNFTPfnXJ8fvM1BMw\" width=\"624\" height=\"489\" role=\"presentation\"></a></strong></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Project Name</th>\n<th>Amount Asked (Funds allocated)</th>\n<th>Amounts disbursed for completing milestones</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Binance Wallet</td>\n<td>28.5K ARB</td>\n<td>28.5K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GMD Protocol</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Perpie</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GMX v2 Telegram &amp; Discord Analytics</td>\n<td>10K ARB</td>\n<td>10K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RabbitHole</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>50K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vaultka</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rodeo Finance</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>33.5K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tradao</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Python SDK</td>\n<td>55K ARB</td>\n<td>55K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dolomite</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>25K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DeltaPrime</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>95K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fluid</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Symbiosis</td>\n<td>50K ARB</td>\n<td>10K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Umami</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tradingview Alert Connector</td>\n<td>4K ARB</td>\n<td>4K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D2 Finance</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>60K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rage Trade</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fungi Protocol</td>\n<td>6K ARB</td>\n<td>6K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DappOS</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pear Protocol</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>40K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Steadefi</td>\n<td>100K ARB</td>\n<td>50K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OKX wallet</td>\n<td>20K ARB</td>\n<td>20K ARB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>$1,673,500 ARB</td>\n<td>$1,290,000 ARB</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"grants-project-highlights-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#grants-project-highlights-16\"></a>Grants Project Highlights</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.gmx.io/t/vaultka-grant-final-update/3289\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Vaultka</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Vaultka is a yield optimisation protocol for decentralised perpetual exchanges on Arbitrum, enabling users to maximise gains and tailor their strategies based on their risk preferences.

The grants program has been a pivotal initiative for the further development of the GMX ecosystem and has helped grow GMX V2 significantly. It has demonstrated the power of community-led initiatives and shown how strategic investments can drive growth and innovation in a decentralised ecosystem.<br>\nBy providing financial support and community involvement, the program has led to significant improvements within the ecosystem and has set a strong foundation for future growth. As we move forward, we will continue to use the grants program as a tool for creating sustainable growth in the GMX ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Anti-Sybil and Anti-Abuse Parameters:</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned in our STIP application, to ensure the integrity of the incentive program, anti-Sybil and anti-abuse parameters were implemented to prevent the incentives from being affected by bots or bad actors. These parameters generated organic volume and attracted genuine users to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Measures were established in consultation with the Liquidity Multi-sig and the GMX DAO to attempt to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure the program’s success.</p>\n<p>By implementing this breakdown of incentives and incorporating anti-Sybil and anti-abuse parameters, we aimed to grow a healthy and sustainable ecosystem on the Arbitrum network. Additionally, according to the<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/openblock-labs-stip-efficacy-sybil-analysis-2-24/21441\"> reports of Open Blocks</a>, our incentives were less Sybiled compared to our competitors and other protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Success of the Program</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>We saw an increase in liquidity, gradually increasing GMX v2 TVL. This increase in TVL reflected the success of the program in attracting and retaining users within the GMX ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Following the incentives, we saw an upsurge in daily trading activity, user count, and the total value locked (TVL) within the protocol.</li>\n<li>After launching the grants program, we saw more than 22 projects building on GMX v2. The increase in the number of active users that engaged with these applications, serves as a benchmark for measuring the success of initiatives aimed at increasing the adoption and usage of GMX v2 and Arbitrum.</li>\n<li>An increase in community participation in the forums, collaborations, and proposals submitted by community members indicates a growth in community engagement and activity, encompassing participation in the incentives, grant applications, and governance.</li>\n<li>Testimonials and success stories from grant recipients and partners within the ecosystem, highlighting the influence of grants on their projects or the ecosystem at large, offer firsthand insight into the grants’ impact.</li>\n<li>We saw an increase in token markets on GMX, with a total of 6 new markets getting listed on GMX v2 for traders, builders and DeFi liquidity providers to engage with.</li>\n<li>The conception and implementation of fresh features and enhancements into the GMX protocol, informed by insights derived from grant-supported projects and collaborations, can be assessed by the count of protocol upgrades and improvements executed, as well as feedback from users and ecosystem partners.</li>\n<li>GMX further enhanced the user experience through continuous protocol improvements and feature enhancements like One-Click Trading, Sub-Accounts and Adaptive Funding Rates.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>GMX has successfully executed its incentive program, achieving notable growth in trading volume, liquidity provision, and community development. We’ve seen increased user engagement, a surge in total value locked (TVL), and numerous successful projects emerging from our grant program.</p>\n<p>The lessons learned from this program, and the strategies we’ve cultivated, will guide our future initiatives as we continue to grow and evolve in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The STIP grant program has been instrumental in driving the growth and progress of GMX v2. The multifaceted approach combining trading incentives, liquidity incentives, and grant incentives has not only boosted user engagement and activity but also significantly increased the total value locked within the protocol.</p>\n<p>Our trading incentives led to a substantial increase in trading volume and attracted a diverse range of traders, while our liquidity incentives resulted in deeper, more stable liquidity pools. This, in turn, improved the overall trading experience for our users. Lastly, the grant incentives played a crucial role in fostering innovation and contributing to the development of the GMX ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We express our gratitude to the Arbitrum DAO and the STIP Grants program for their support. And we look forward to continuing our journey in creating a robust, efficient, and user-friendly decentralised exchange, which simultaneously functions as a liquidity base layer for all of Arbitrum DeFi.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/leveraging-the-stip-grants-program-to-grow-the-gmx-and-arbitrum-defi-ecosystem/23100\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/leveraging-the-stip-grants-program-to-grow-the-gmx-and-arbitrum-defi-ecosystem/23100","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 19:16:57 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23100"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/leveraging-the-stip-grants-program-to-grow-the-gmx-and-arbitrum-defi-ecosystem/23100.rss","#text":"Leveraging the STIP Grants Program to grow the GMX and Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem"},"filter":true},{"title":"9 Apr 2024 - Open Discussion of Proposals Governance Call","dc:creator":"cliffton.eth","category":"Governance","description":"<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n<p>The link to join the governance call to discuss the proposal pipeline and notable discussions is on the <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/Warsaw\">governance calendar </a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Date: 9 April 2024</strong><br>\n<strong>Time: 4:00 pm UTC</strong><br>\nLink to join: <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/kvr-bpnx-zix\">https://meet.google.com/kvr-bpnx-zix </a></p>\n<p>I’ve put together a fluid agenda below.

With the strategic movements, we brought an additional 60k active users and $300m in transaction volume to Arbitrum, both significantly surpassing the initial KPIs set.</p>\n<p>OpenOcean as a dex aggregator, the growth in our platform also generates economic value and volume to all integrated dexs/liquidity sources, since every swap made on our platform will bring users, volume and fee revenue to liquidity pools routed. In addition, with collaborating partners that use OpenOcean routing service, such as Camelot, we offered extra gas fee rebates while users swapped on the protocol.</p>\n<p>In addition, OpenOcean’s cross-chain swap aggregator also helps encourage more users to</p>\n<p>explore Arbitrum from other 7 chains. We also onboarded Chainlink’s new CCIP solution on Arbitrum to better support users and other protocols bridging assets to Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Moreover, our collaborative efforts with over 10 protocols integrated our API to bootstrap active users, trading volume, and swaps, bringing diversity to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This approach has fostered innovation and growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem, marking a growth and development on Arbitrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Key metrics

As an introductory proposal and a call for collaborators, we welcome feedback from delegates, analysts, protocols, Orbit chains, and the community.</em></p>\n<p><em>We’d also like to note that while this proposal is under development, it is designed to complement existing Arbitrum project incentive programs like STIP and LTIPP, as well as Foundation programs for Orbit partners. It is not intended to compete with or deter those programs, but rather bring new tooling, onchain innovation, and important marketplace dynamics to the Arbitrum Incentives ecosystem.</em></p>\n<h1><a name=\"abstract-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#abstract-1\"></a>Abstract</h1>\n<p>The Arbitrum Orbit Stimulus Pilot introduces an objective and metric-driven onchain incentives program designed to provide infrastructure and tokens to help grow Arbitrum’s Orbit chains.</p>\n<p>This proposal evolves protocol-driven incentives by leveraging composable, permissionless, and onchain infrastructure to facilitate decentralization, via third-party incentives managers, and streamlined operations, via onchain tooling.</p>\n<p>The proposal introduces a six-month and 9M ARB program to support user growth and retention on up to six Arbitrum Orbit chains. Orbit chains will be selected via an Arbitrum DAO council with a budget to both setup infrastructure and incentives to bootstrap their project. Each accepted chain is eligible to receive the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Up to 1M ARB for onchain user incentives (including performance fees for Incentive Managers, etc.)</li>\n<li>Up to 500k ARB budget for onchain infrastructure support (Including rpc, indexer, data, and incentives infrastructure).</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The ultimate motivation of this proposal is to simultaneously endow Arbitrum Orbit chains with long-term onchain infrastructure for sustainable growth while simultaneously offering an alternative model that improves upon existing incentives programs by addressing existing issues of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karelvuong/status/1749859056292942268?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bureaucracy</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0x_ultra\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">capture</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-now-a-pragmatic-approach-for-the-moment/15779\">inefficiencies</a>.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrum Orbit strategy represents “freedom”. By encouraging its Orbit partners to customize their L2/L3 chains with unprecedented flexibility, Arbitrum is well positioned to attract a diversity of use-cases, structures, and strategies to the ecosystem. As such, this proposal aims to establish growth support for every Orbit chain (defined as an Orbit L2 sharing sequencer revenue or an Orbit L3 built on Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova).</p>\n<p>We believe that validating the efficacy of onchain incentives infrastructure and performance-driven incentives will establish a foundation for long-term Orbit success. Equipped with robust tooling, Orbit chains, the DAO, and even third-parties (DEXs, onchain games, creators, etc.) can leverage the infra beyond the ARB granted from the program, either leveraging future grants, native tokens or digital assets, even when DAO incentives dry up.</p>\n<p>The proposal aims to address multiple issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Experience</strong>: By establishing a unified incentives funnel, it seeks to unify Orbit chain discovery into a cohesive user experience, addressing fragmented users and providing a scalable growth strategy for each protocol’s journey from an app to a chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Onchain Tooling</strong>: By replacing short-term programs with long-term tooling and infrastructure, Orbit chains will leave the Stimulus Pilot program with robust user data (CAC, segmentation analysis, growth metrics) and onchain relationships with their users, extending value beyond the status quo of continuous incentives via program extensions.</li>\n<li><strong>Objective-based Grants</strong>: By grounding Orbit growth in <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/learnings-from-stip-community-interview-summaries-and-notes/20916\">objective</a> metric-based <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353/14\">strategies</a> (i.e. <a href=\"https://journey.mantle.xyz/en/rewards\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mantle</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.blast.io/airdrop/api\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blast</a>, <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/3tkU-Y5479JPw83I6jp7GTu_0_q-TWEKAXckm3XKl28\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism</a>) the DAO can align it’s impact with specific Orbit chain goals and objectives.</li>\n<li><strong>Evolving Onchain Incentives</strong>: As a pilot step toward the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-new-thesis-for-network-level-incentives-programs/20757\">direct-to-contract philosophy</a>, the Arbitrum Orbit Stimulus Pilot aims to realign DAO grants with blockchain principles: transparency, decentralization, and <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">automation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Arbitrum DAO has approved over 115M ARB worth of incentive grants on Arbitrum. Although these<a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-new-thesis-for-network-level-incentives-programs/20757\"> project-based grants</a> spurred significant on-chain activity, they’ve been impeded by operational inefficiencies, unclear governance, and a lack of strategic direction. The absence of clearly defined success metrics has created a disconnect between <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353/27\">expectations and outcomes</a>. The DAO has largely been unable to define success, leading to misaligned expectations, grants, and results. Further, as Arbitrum chains grows, its user base becomes increasingly fragmented, leading to a disunified user experience and making it more difficult to explore complementary protocols and chains in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This fragmentation complicates interaction with complementary protocols and chains within the ecosystem. While previous incentives favor protocols with precedent and governance influence (existing dApps on Arbitrum), an increasing wave of partners and protocols require support for new challenges in launching Orbit chains. This proposal advocates for a technical collaboration to foster and validate efficient, decentralized, and forkable on-chain workflows, along with tooling that will last long beyond the incentives themselves.</p>\n<p>Concentrating on Arbitrum Orbit chains, this proposal aims to establish an adaptable, user-centric, and accountable bootstrapping framework. This initiative is designed to address unique challenges of L2 and L3 chains, offering innovative solutions that underline the proposal’s goal to exemplify its strategies within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"program-structure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-structure-4\"></a>Program Structure</h1>\n<p>The program is managed by three key roles: The Orbit Pilot Council, Orbit Grantees, and Incentive Managers.</p>\n<p>How incentive programs generally work</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/1sHBBHz6XNS05mrgoypjlvPx6AX.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_539x427.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"1sHBBHz6XNS05mrgoypjlvPx6AX\" width=\"539\" height=\"427\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_539x427.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_808x640.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0a40cc9f7924d2290c72d2be048b366ef1477913_2_1078x854.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAF8F1\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>How The Orbit Stimulus Pilot Works<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/brRK90SCwLy141pwQKHbPGbCMaV.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_494x402.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"brRK90SCwLy141pwQKHbPGbCMaV\" width=\"494\" height=\"402\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_494x402.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_741x603.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/503e551b0697be65898067c6422770574282c5e5_2_988x804.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F1F6ED\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Program Roles and Responsibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orbit Pilot Council</strong>: The Orbit Pilot Council is responsible for evaluating, approving, and validating both Orbit Grantee and Incentive Manager applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Orbit Grantees</strong>: These are the Orbit Chains receiving incentives. They work with eligible Incentive Managers to define key objectives, metrics, campaigns, and KPIs. Orbit Grantees are approved by the Orbit Pilot Council.</li>\n<li><strong>Incentive Managers</strong>: These are professionals or entities whitelisted by the Orbit Pilot Council to design and deploy incentive strategies tailored to Orbit chains’ unique needs.

Incentive Managers can use no-code onchain tools to incentivize specific onchain actions, with parameters like address whitelisting, action types, protocols, assets, reward sizes, and incentive lengths.</p>\n<p>The innovative approach outlined below leverages the Llama protocol alongside a sovereign governance model, integrating role-based solutions to streamline grant operations without compromising the core principles of flexibility and decentralization. This model employs a contract system to establish a primary account and define policyholders, utilizing soulbound ERC-721 tokens to enable permissioned responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this framework introduces a management platform and no code incentives deployment, facilitating the direct control of DAO over program goals while ensuring compensation and monetization for each side of the incentives marketplace. The subsequent sections will delve into the distribution mechanisms, data and measurement strategies, and the economic impact of these innovations, underpinning a governance model that not only enhances program management but also fosters accountability, transparency, and community engagement in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"onchain-program-management-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#onchain-program-management-8\"></a>Onchain Program Management</h3>\n<p>The Program employs a role-based solution using <a href=\"https://llama.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Llama</a> protocol contracts, streamlining grant operations while maintaining flexibility and decentralization. The contract establishes a primary account, with the ability to define policyholders. A policy is a soulbound ERC-721 granted to an EOA, enabling permissioned responsibilities to either create (mint) new policyholder NFTs or spend permissioned amounts from the Llama primary account. This structure allows for onchain program management, ensuring both security and the use of funds on the appropriate use cases.</p>\n<p>The following summary outlines a sovereign governance model that enables direct DAO control over program goals, objectives, budgets, and managers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orbit Program Account</strong>: An account managed by Policyholders. This account will receive the program budget (ARB) from the Arbitrum Treasury upon passage of the AIP. The program account will only be able to transfer ARB on the whitelisted deployment addresses (Boost Deployer Contract Address) OR in a clawback to the Arbitrum Treasury. The Orbit Pilot Council will be able to select a spend limit for each approved Orbit Program Account (one account per accepted grantee).</li>\n<li><strong>Incentive Managers</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orbit Pilot Council Policy</strong>: The Orbit Pilot Council Policy will be assigned to a specific budget within the Program Account to which the Orbit Pilot Council may assign Incentive Manager Policies for each program (Network Stimulus, User Adoption, and Incentive Sandbox).</li>\n<li><strong>Incentive Manager Policy</strong>: Incentive Managers will be permissioned to spend ARB from the Program Account.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>View the technical specifications of this onchain infrastructure here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Id3h-_ShUy_PV2Y7Bh5aSLW6oN2Q_hJ9OH67bJRGNdQ/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Orbit Incentives Technical Spec</a></p>\n<h3><a name=\"no-code-incentives-deployment-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#no-code-incentives-deployment-9\"></a>No Code Incentives Deployment</h3>\n<p>To encourage both decentralization and streamline incentive deployment, Incentives Managers will leverage the <a href=\"https://manager.boost.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost Manager</a> toolkit.

Unlike traditional incentive programs, which require users to find the app chain independently, these frontends also facilitate user discovery through many centralized locations (including frontends hosted by dApps, Orbit chains themselves, and by the Arbitrum Foundation), while the core infrastructure and earning opportunities operate entirely on-chain.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1671e93cd085a42f5618c5b3d0c86920ad3b2d50.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3cyyzSP33vDWPGsENDxHCcpuFDq.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1671e93cd085a42f5618c5b3d0c86920ad3b2d50_2_512x288.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"3cyyzSP33vDWPGsENDxHCcpuFDq\" width=\"512\" height=\"288\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1671e93cd085a42f5618c5b3d0c86920ad3b2d50_2_512x288.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1671e93cd085a42f5618c5b3d0c86920ad3b2d50_2_768x432.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1671e93cd085a42f5618c5b3d0c86920ad3b2d50_2_1024x576.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"888A8B\"></a></div><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/e/e8f13a540b79beb7645c464d4d2f12b8323218c5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/xeHBhQPsSzjgBFmYMEZ5elVDyLz.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e8f13a540b79beb7645c464d4d2f12b8323218c5_2_511x288.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"xeHBhQPsSzjgBFmYMEZ5elVDyLz\" width=\"511\" height=\"288\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e8f13a540b79beb7645c464d4d2f12b8323218c5_2_511x288.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e8f13a540b79beb7645c464d4d2f12b8323218c5_2_766x432.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/e8f13a540b79beb7645c464d4d2f12b8323218c5_2_1022x576.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"8A8C8E\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"data-and-measurement-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#data-and-measurement-11\"></a>Data and Measurement</h3>\n<p>A key shortcoming of incentive programs to date has been the lack of standardized data at both the strategic program level, and the tactical level. Despite strong efforts, the DAO has failed to agree upon concrete KPIs, while paying for reporting that, as a result, provides little actionable information. KPIs and accurately report them. To help solve this issue, this proposal provides financial support for both RPC and Indexer costs (if needed). Eligible chains will also receive integration with either Dune or Flipside, providing open data for the community and, therefore, accountability and performance.</p>\n<p>Leveraging native attribution, standardized claims, and the <a href=\"https://docs.boost.xyz/boost-protocol/for-developers/boost-api\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost API</a>, this proposal enables comparable analysis in real-time. As each Incentive Manager deploys strategies, The Orbit Pilot Council and Orbit Grantees have the ability to provide feedback on iterative campaigns. This means that each individual Boost strategy can be picked apart, compared, and incentive managers can conduct sophisticated methods such as A/B testing, targeted whitelisting, and iterative approaches.</p>\n<p>The goal is to collaborate with these entities to create comprehensive dashboards tailored to the specific objectives of each program. These dashboards will enable anyone to analyze, report, and evaluate the performance of various incentive strategies deployed by Incentive Managers. Since the underlying data is open-source, these dashboards can be modified, built upon, or critiqued by anyone in the community, fostering transparency and collaborative improvement.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"key-performance-indicators-kpis-and-data-driven-results-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-performance-indicators-kpis-and-data-driven-results-12\"></a>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Data Driven Results</h3>\n<p>Imperative to the proposal is the ability for each Orbit chain to be accountable to deliver reasonable and expected results. Thus, Incentives Managers, the Arbitrum Orbit Council, and Orbit Chains will work together to define and present key performance metrics to support their proposed strategies. The Council will be responsible for the approval of Orbit Chain KPIs and deployment objectives, while Incentive Managers and Orbit Chains will work together to design and implement strategies, iterating based on real-time results and campaign objectives.</p>\n<p>Depending on the chain, these metrics will be held as key indicators in each grant’s structure, holding both grantees and incentive managers accountable to performance. User KPIs will benefit from in-depth analyst guidance, including user segmentation, profiling, advanced targeting, and sybil-resistance (where necessary). Alternative KPIs can include number of transactions, mints, strategic asset volumes, bridging volume, etc., all depending on a chains specific business needs and objectives.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"program-economics-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-economics-13\"></a>Program Economics</h2>\n<p>Beyond its technical advantages, the Orbit Stimulus Program also features a built-in attribution that streamlines and powers a compensation structure to align each program stakeholder within the program itself. This allows earning opportunities for Incentive Managers, user frontends (through referrals), and further protocol development.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"incentive-managers-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#incentive-managers-14\"></a>Incentive Managers</h3>\n<p>The program’s success heavily relies on incentive managers, responsible for crafting and implementing strategies for Orbit grantees. To attract and compensate these managers, the program leverages Boost Protocol’s fee structures, allocating one-third of all protocol claim fees and 5% of all rewards to the managers (see fee structure below). This approach not only aligns the interests of the program and the incentive managers but also makes the role appealing to analysts and third parties, fostering competition for these positions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"frontend-clients-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#frontend-clients-15\"></a>Frontend Clients</h3>\n<p>Boost Studios will collaborate with the Arbitrum DAO to develop and launch an Arbitrum Inbox front-end, serving as a central point for user engagement. This platform will not only facilitate user discovery but also generate revenue through Boost Protocols’ fee mechanisms. By leveraging Boost Protocol’s attribution feature, frontend clients can access one-third of protocol claim fees and 2.5% of all rewards generated. This revenue-generation capability extends to the DAO and third-party frontend clients, including grantees, motivating them to integrate with the platform. This integration fosters a competitive environment among frontends, wallets, and dApps, all aiming to attract users to Orbit chain incentives.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"protocol-maintenance-and-growth-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#protocol-maintenance-and-growth-16\"></a>Protocol Maintenance and Growth</h3>\n<p>Funds are directed to the <a href=\"https://app.llama.xyz/orgs/boost\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Boost Guild</a>, a group of Boost community members, to encourage innovation and activity on the Boost Protocol.

The DEF uniquely provides a dedicated voice for DAOs and DeFi in legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy efforts. You can find a summary of their past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US, below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-3\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>DeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.</p>\n<p>At this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.</p>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.</p>\n<p>Originally funded by Uniswap governance in 2021 with a one million UNI grant, DeFi Education Fund’s work is a public good that periodically requires funding to continue. This proposal would contribute funding to the organization so that it can expand its legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.</p>\n<p>The DeFi Education Fund’s work focuses on (further details below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Legal advocacy and litigation for DeFi, DAOs, and developers;</li>\n<li>Fighting regulatory overreach from the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, CFPB, IRS, et. al.;</li>\n<li>Advocating and lobbying for DeFi in Congress and at the state level;</li>\n<li>Educating elected representatives and traditional media about DeFi and its benefits; and</li>\n<li>Informing and serving the DeFi community about policy and regulatory developments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DEF is eager to continue leading the charge in the fight on behalf of DeFi. We can only do that with the backing of the DeFi community, which is why we will be initiating governance proposals for financial support from several DAOs. With the community’s support, we will</p>\n<ol>\n<li>super charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;</li>\n<li>expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;</li>\n<li>more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; and</li>\n<li>enhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"more-information-on-def-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#more-information-on-def-4\"></a>More Information on DEF</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/about\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Team</a>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/millercwl\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Miller Whitehouse-Levine</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amandatums\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Amanda Tuminelli</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbernstein6395\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Max Bernstein</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LazPieper\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lizandro Peiper</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://defieducationfund.substack.com/archive\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Weekly updates</a> on policy developments and activities</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTt5vI0P5MuBF2vq1UyhByKqmM6XbMp-twre8ahm_gs/edit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">12 Month Estimated Budget</a></li>\n<li>Historical financial <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/financial-information\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">information</a> (annual and monthly)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fund_defi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">X</a></li>\n<li>Contact - Please reach out to discuss!\n<ul>\n<li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:miller@defieducationfund.org\">miller@defieducationfund.org</a></li>\n<li>Telegram: <span class=\"mention\">@millwl</span></li>\n<li>Twitter: <span class=\"mention\">@fund_defi</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"implementation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#implementation-5\"></a>Implementation</h2>\n<p>Upon passage, 500,000 ARB is to be transferred to and held in a <a href=\"https://arbiscan.io/address/0x937561C09a3b19317958438489B4Bd0a8C986e45\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">dedicated wallet</a> at Coinbase.

Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"faqs-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#faqs-7\"></a>FAQs</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Why are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are seeking Arbitrum’s support now for three primary reasons.</p>\n<p>First, we need a sense of our longer term funding in order to take on the projects that our work focuses on, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will take a total of at least two years from start to finish. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting that challenge, we would not have been able to take that project on. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.</p>\n<p>Second, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States could cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects.</p>\n<p>Third, DeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Why are you asking Arbitrum for money and not other DAOs?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will definitely be passing around the hat! We seek Arbitrum’s support as a leading DAO that is building for the long term. The Uniswap DAO took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that other leading DAOs will contribute to funding our work going forward.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>When and how are you planning on selling tokens?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is important to us that the DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. We will hold half of any ARB tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will not sell any ARB tokens without pre-disclosing a sales plan in writing. For example, we received our initial grant from the Uniswap DAO in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18-month written <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/post/def-provides-update-on-our-funding\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">sales plan</a>. We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"accomplishments-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#accomplishments-8\"></a>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h4>\n<p>Legal Advocacy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEC v.

Internal Revenue Service - In October 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_492b137460ef4263aa43f3fcb946a1cd.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in a case involving a challenge to a “John Doe” summons the IRS sent to Coinbase that resulted in the collection of information (including information revealing on-chain wallet addresses) about 14,355 Americans (none of whom were accused of any wrongdoing prior to the summons) over a three-year period. Our brief explained the sweeping Fourth Amendment implications of indiscriminately collecting digital asset transaction information and how doing so is more revealing than in the context of TradFi.</li>\n<li>SEC v. Coinbase - In August 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_05b10d3583a647b08dd071727ab8b7f1.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in support of Coinbase. We explained how wallets and staking actually work and supported Coinbase’s arguments that it is not a broker through its wallet software, nor did it offer securities through its staking program.</li>\n<li>Coin Center v. Treasury - In June 2023, we filed an <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_aff0399d95324a94af6b5f6cd3e31b91.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">amicus brief</a> in support of a challenge to OFAC’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment ag. In October 2022, Coin Center and several individuals sued Treasury, challenging OFAC’s designation of Tornado Cash smart contracts. The plaintiffs argued that doing so exceeded the Treasury’s authority, and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the First Amendment. Our brief supported arguments that the sanctions were beyond the Treasury Department’s statutory authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act, made the point that Tornado Cash is an important privacy-protection tool, and argued that the sanctions designations made no sense when considering the realities of the technology at issue.</li>\n<li>Van Loon v. Treasury - In April 2023, we submitted our first <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_347cf86b54b540e9be5773f8560d62bc.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">brief</a> related to Treasury’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash smart contracts. In addition to Treasury’s lack of statutory basis for the actions, We argued that the downstream implications of sanctioning a software protocol will lead to not only a weakening of the digital asset industry, but will also seriously jeopardize law-abiding Americans’ financial privacy.</li>\n<li>CFTC v. Ooki DAO - In late 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) served Ooki DAO, alleging it is “illegally offering leveraged and margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets” without a Futures Commission Merchant designation or a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) program. The CFTC served “Ooki DAO” via a help chat box with a contemporaneous notice posted on a website purportedly affiliated with Ooki DAO. We filed a brief in the case explaining: “First, the Commission has named Ooki DAO as a defendant in this action, asserting that Ooki DAO is an “unincorporated association comprised of Ooki Token holders.” But nothing about the structure of a DAO inherently dictates that result. In many cases, DAOs lack any central organization or management, and many DAO token holders often lack coordination or common objectives. As a result, DAOs will often not be “associations” of any kind, and therefore will not be proper defendants in an enforcement action brought under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), which requires that a defendant be a “person” (defined to include “associations”). The Commission has not yet alleged facts sufficient to establish that Ooki DAO is an association, so its attempt to serve Ooki DAO here is premature.”</li>\n<li>Combatting crypto patent trolls: In September 2023, we took action to protect DeFi and crypto from invalid patent infringement claims. We filed a<a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_ed2f23226fbb4adaa53b86efa5d58f44.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> petition</a> with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to initiate an inter partes review and cancellation of all claims in a patent owned by True Return Systems LLC. TRS is a patent troll who first tried to sell the patent as an NFT, and when that didn’t work, sued both MakerDAO and Compound Protocol in federal court for alleged infringement of<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US10025797B1/en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"> U.S. Patent No. 10,025,797</a>. Our petition argued that the technology that TRS purported to patent was not in fact TRS’s invention, but was instead very similar to oracle technology that had been in development and use for years prior to the patent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regulatory Advocacy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In January 2024, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_a5bb9050d8414cbab3f0285202464a29.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">urged</a> the Department of the Treasury to reconsider its proposed rule to classify crypto “mixing” transactions to be a “primary money laundering concern” subject to enhanced reporting requirements. Among the issues we commented on is the proposal’s all-encompassing definition of “mixing,” which would capture almost all crypto transactions and designate them to be “high risk.”</li>\n<li>In January 2024, we submitted <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_4bdb18a7e1b94bfea406dfbb0a0ffcc8.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">our thoughts</a> on a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed rulemaking that could expand the CFPB’s supervisory authority to capture self-hosted wallets. We argued that the rulemaking should not move forward as it would further scramble the Federal government’s already-convoluted regulatory treatment of DeFi and crypto-related activities.</li>\n<li>In November 2023, we filed a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/e53159_40d4255857d142f2a1744be79f1dab3f.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">comment letter</a> regarding the Treasury Department’s proposed “broker” rulemaking. The proposed rule would introduce a brand new category of broker called a “digital asset middleman,” a new term that is essentially limitless in scope and creates brokers out of thin air in DeFi and, as we argue, runs contrary to the statute and legislative history. Furthermore, we argued that the proposal violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on warrantless searches and seizures of a person’s papers and effects because individuals do not voluntarily turn over their personal data to “digital asset middlemen” who themselves neither collect nor have any legitimate business reason to collect that information. For a plain language review of our issues with the rulemaking, read: “<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/11/15/congress-gets-the-runaround-from-regulators-again/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Congress Gets the Runaround From Regulators, Again</a>.”</li>\n<li>In October 2023, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_1dfebf33d77f40a0895314105ed47079.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to France’s Autorité de Marchés Financiers (AMF) concerning their DeFi regulatory discussion paper. Our comment letter addressed many topics including permissionless blockchain protocols, legal enforceability of smart contracts, off-chain elements, etc. Importantly, we addressed the legal liability of smart contract developers, arguing that smart contracts’ code is open-source for anyone to audit and make informed decisions. Furthermore, we argued that open-source code is a form of expression as it conveys ideas for societal change and demands protection. We also argued against the AMF’s proposal to create a government-run certification regime for smart contracts.</li>\n<li>In September 2023, we <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_94bb62e0bac1428585c944bc06884bd2.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to a request for comment from the Senate Finance Committee regarding the taxation of digital assets. In our submission, we recommended Congress: 1) Revise Section 6050I so that it does not “deputize recipients of digital assets to collect and report information about their payers;” 2) Do not tax staking rewards until a sale or other disposition; 3) Do not apply wash sale rules to taxpayers who utilize digital assets as a form of currency; and 4) explicitly extend the application of section 1058’s nonrecognition rule to “loans” of actively traded fungible tokens.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we submitted a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_e73f5656c9a047788521cf09259db7a4.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response </a>to a consultation from HM Revenue and Customs, the United Kingdom’s tax, payments, and customs authority, regarding “the taxation of DeFi involving the lending and staking of cryptoassets.” At a high-level, our submission noted that any changes to the tax regime that concern DeFi must: be flexible to account for future innovation; exhibit clarity and simplicity to promote compliance by minimizing the burden on taxpayers; and align with the underlying economic substance of a typical DeFi transaction.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we submitted a <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_dbc796a8e44644539ffcd4722e1b442a.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response </a>to Banque of France’s Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) regarding their discussion paper: “Decentralised’ or ‘Disintermediated’ Finance: What Regulatory Response?” Our primary arguments included that ACPR should not directly regulate miners and validators by establishing standards for public blockchains; a policy that would “force centralization” would eliminate the core innovations of public blockchains; and a framework for smart contract certification would require centralization and the inappropriate regulation of speech.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, we filed our <a href=\"https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_f997b07bbb6d43b8a3b6c0626f57cdf3.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">third comment letter</a> on the SEC’s proposed “exchange” rulemaking. Our brief made two primary arguments: first, the proposal improperly reads and misapplies the Exchange Act and exceeds the SEC’s statutory authority and mandate under the Act; and second, the SEC has flatly failed to comply with numerous procedural and statutory rulemaking requirements.</li>\n<li>In August 2022, the DEF filed a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khRThXkBfev9uTTtSlakcckfKjP1_8TT/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">response</a> to the U.S. Treasury Department’s request for comment on innovation in digital assets. In our response, we explained how DeFi protocols have the potential to benefit consumers, investors, and businesses in the United States and around the world by creating accessible financial infrastructure usable by any individual with an internet connection.</li>\n<li>In June 2022, we <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y6_UbL2DBMvICeuhdENSGGWPJrZCBAWM/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">responded</a> to Abu Dhabi’s DeFi consultation, in which we expressed our view that decentralization and disintermediation serve important societal objectives and that forcing the reintroduction of intermediation via legal obligations is a misguided approach to DeFi that would undermine its core potential and innovation.</li>\n<li>In June 2022, In our second <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1inWXw7MSO8VjrbuPro8izeewgmRGNC9r/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">letter</a> on the SEC’s exchange rulemaking, we argued that the proposed rule represents an improperly static regulatory response to a dynamic innovation and therefore needs to be reconsidered in total.</li>\n<li>In May 2022, we <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GC4QPms1JxzrBr7sLDlSzoVVk3EcTsNP/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">commented</a> on the SEC’s “dealer” rulemaking, which could not only subject large DeFi market participants to the threat of arbitrary SEC enforcement actions but also, potentially, capture liquidity pools themselves as so-called “dealers” under the securities laws. But how would it do so? In what way? The SEC did not say when it proposed the rule nor when it later finalized the rule in early 2024, which we expect to see challenged in court. .</li>\n<li>In April 2022, we submitted the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cjQIDH3VE9303k-r55lQFfn1v-tH5l0n/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">first</a> of three comment letters on the SEC’s “exchange” rulemaking, which would de facto ban DeFi protocols in the United States. We argued that the Proposal’s expanded definition of an “exchange” is so broad that it could be interpreted to cover DeFi market participants, yet the rule didn’t specify which or why—it didn’t even mention “crypto,” “DeFi,” or “digital assets” once. In January 2023 in response to these concerns, the SEC released 167 pages of additional information explaining that the proposal does apply to DeFi and crypto, which we also responded to.</li>\n<li>In April 2022, we submitted a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kaURtD9UIFBaB4mMkcZXRi15uGJ5d3dK/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">comment letter</a> to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on its proposed <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/oecd-seeks-input-on-new-tax-transparency-framework-for-crypto-assets-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.htm\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">framework</a> for tax reporting in the digital asset ecosystem. Broadly, when it comes to DeFi, the proposal fits squarely in the “how do we apply existing regulations and tactics to innovative systems” camp. This concept would force the creation of intermediaries where they do not exist for tax reporting purposes, a concept that the Treasury Department is now attempting to enshrine in the United States (see November 2023 comment letter on the IRS’s proposed “broker” rulemaking).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Legislative Advocacy</p>\n<p>The past year has yielded some fruit in the industry’s push for crypto-specific legislation, but legislation is still a few years out, in our view. In July, The House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) voted, with bipartisan support, to advance the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/20/us-house-republicans-introduce-crypto-oversight-bill-to-protect-investors/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act</a>, a bill that would create a regulatory framework for crypto in the U.S. That same month, the HFSC advanced a bill to establish a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4766/BILLS-118hr4766ih.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">federal regulatory regime</a> for stablecoins.</p>\n<p>More recently, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce passed the <a href=\"https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/H_R_Deploying_American_Blockchains_Act_Reps_Bucshon_and_Blunt_Rochester_e4ce972799.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Deploying American Blockchains Act</a> (by a 46-0 margin), which would direct the chief of the Department of Commerce “to promote the competitiveness of the United States related to the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology.” While these bills are not perfect, we’re pleased that Congress has taken a serious approach to these matters.</p>\n<p>There’s another factor that gives us hope for the long-term chances of good legislation passing both chambers. And that is the willingness of Congressional offices and policymakers to engage with DEF and learn about the foundational aspects of the technology. We do “DeFi Demos” on Capitol Hill and advocate for policies welcoming of DeFi and DAOs. We explain why we believe in DeFi and why government officials and elected representatives should be just as curious as we are as to how this technology can improve the lives of their constituents. Away from sensational media headlines and televised hearings, one can see that a better, more open future for DeFi is developing.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we’ve provided a perspective from DeFi’s corner on the following federal legislation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>H.R. 1122, CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act</li>\n<li>H.R. 1177/S. 427, Financial Freedom Act of 2023</li>\n<li>H.R. 1414.

Because they were subsidized with ARB rewards, they were mostly exclusive to Arbitrum network deployments, which brought many new active users exclusively to the Arbitrum network deployments. A shining example is the March Madness campaign, where users could mint a Bracket NFT on Arbitrum to participate in the Bracket Competition while also having secondary rewards for all March Madness volume drivers.

We ran a three-month (January-March 2024) hybrid blockchain development boot camp, featuring a hackathon, to onboard quality developers into the Arbitrum ecosystem. The program is divided into two tracks - front-end and back-end development.</p>\n<p>Front-end developers learned how to integrate the Arbitrum SDK into their applications and develop amazing web3 UI/UX. Back-end developers, on the other hand, focused on building scalable backends using Node.js and integrating Arbitrum. Participants in both tracks learned Solidity and Ether.js.</p>\n<p>The physical sessions were live-streamed and recorded, allowing participants to contribute in real-time and ensuring an all-round engagement. We believe these recorded classes will serve as resources for anyone interested in building on the Arbitrum chain in the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"key-milestones-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-milestones-3\"></a>Key Milestones</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>800 registrations</li>\n<li>164 preliminary selection</li>\n<li>100 participants</li>\n<li>43 completed the program</li>\n<li>6 Projects submitted for the hackathon</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"program-goals-vs-achievements-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#program-goals-vs-achievements-4\"></a>Program Goals vs Achievements</h2>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Goal</th>\n<th>Achievement</th>\n<th>Achieved?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Achieve 500 registrations for the program.</td>\n<td>Achieve 800 registrations for the program.</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Create engagement with 100 active participants the program.</td>\n<td>Achieved 100 participants</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Target an 80-90% completion rate among participants.</td>\n<td>Achieved 43% completion rate</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Render assistance to participants in launching a minimum of 10 projects on Arbitrum.</td>\n<td>Only 6 Projects deployed from the Hackthon</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provide live and recorded video sessions of every class within the program</td>\n<td>Achieved 100% video recording</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Receive anonymous feedback and ratings from participants.</td>\n<td>We collected anonymous feedback and ratings from participants.</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Create a program evaluation report 2-3 months after the program ends to analyse its long-term impact on the participants.</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sponsor/participate in pitching events for participants to onboard users into their projects.</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n<td>Pending</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Generate media coverage through billboard advertisements and social media promotions, with an expected reach of 25,000 to 50,000 people.</td>\n<td>YouTube - 20,000+ impression</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Put together an end-of-program report to highlight achievements.</td>\n<td>Twitter - 15,773+ views</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Generate a comprehensive monthly report on training progress.</td>\n<td>We submitted monthly reports on Questbook, Arbitrum Forum and KarmaGap</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"projects-from-the-hackathon-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#projects-from-the-hackathon-5\"></a>Projects from the Hackathon</h2>\n<p>During the last week of the Bootcamp, a Twitter space was held on the 27th of February to announce the timeline of the Hackathon and explain the other Hackathon requirements to the participants. During this Twitter space, the judges for the Hackathon were introduced and asked to give useful tips for project development to the participants. The building and the submission period started from the 1st of March to the 23rd of March but was later extended due to a timezone error when setting up the hackathon on DoraHack. Individuals with strong affiliations and interests in the Arbitrum ecosystem were chosen as the hackathon judges. The Hackathon review started on March 24th, 2024, and ended on March 28th, 2024. They were able to review, grade, and give helpful comments on each of the Hackathon projects. The projects are outlined below:</p>\n<p><strong>1.

This number was narrowed down through a preliminary selection process to 164 candidates, culminating in a final selection of 100 candidates. Out of the 100 candidates selected, 54 opted for the front-end track, while 46 pursued the back-end development path within the program.</p>\n<p>We prioritized inclusivity, ensuring equal opportunities for both male and female candidates, and applying a balanced set of selection criteria uniformly across all participants.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f0f9716ef8a0b0e428e9457c0443a527e40166e0.png\" alt=\"image3\" data-base62-sha1=\"ynL1nEQqE3Yr1rRqVdif1o5OyEE\" width=\"421\" height=\"417\"></p>\n<p>Of the participants selected, 16 opted for onsite classes while the remaining 84 participants attended the classes virtually.</p>\n<p>Throughout the two months of boot camp, our goal was to maximize participant engagement, as evidenced by two key indicators: the rate of assignment submissions and attendance. We consistently aimed for high performance in these areas to gauge the program’s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>The rate of attendance reduced as the Bootcamp came to an end while the YouTube watch rate increased significantly. Two major factors contributed to participants not attending the live classes: school/work commitments and internet connectivity issues. We provided immediate solutions for each of these challenges.</p>\n<p>The attendance rates dropped in the second month compared to the first, due to learners’ inability to attend the live classes. This led to an increase in the amount of time spent watching our YouTube content and the impressions received on the channel. This trend highlighted learners’ preference for flexible learning options and also showed that external parties benefited from the program’s content.</p>\n<p><img

This goes as far back as 1990 when Phil Zimmerman released Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), one of the first openly available public-key cryptography applications that featured end-to-end (E2E) encryption. Zimmerman’s creation prompted a criminal investigation that was eventually dropped, resulting in federal court decisions that protect encryption under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. This clash on personal privacy became dubbed the “encryption wars.”</p>\n<p>Our team over at Axis Advisory has published a write-up that offers contextual information in relation to the above: <a href=\"https://axisadvisoryxyz.substack.com/p/defending-open-source-a-united-stand\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Defending Open Source: A United Stand for Developer Rights and Software Freedom</a></p>\n<p>In this regard, we are proposing a contribution from the ArbitrumDAO to CoinCenter to continue its policy &amp; litigation efforts in relation to privacy-enhancement tooling and software developer advocacy. Some of Coin Center’s most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Coin Center’s case against the Office of Foreign Assets Control about adding Tornado Cash to the OFAC Sanction List, (naturally, Tornado Cash not being a person or entity but a mere set of open-source smart contracts running on the Ethereum Blockchain).

They argued that the proposed designation lacks clarity and narrowly tailored definitions, potentially leading to the misclassification of legitimate transactions as criminal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>[Refer: <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/comments-to-the-financial-crimes-enforcement-network-on-proposal-of-special-measure-regarding-convertible-virtual-currency-mixing-as-a-class-of-transactions-of-primary-money-laundering-conce/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Comments to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on “Proposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing, as a Class of Transactions of Primary Money Laundering Concern”</a>]</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Coin Center’s letter to the Senate Finance Committee highlighing the need for a regulatory approach that mirrors the successful, light-touch framework applied to the internet.

Our mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code – to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately. We do this by producing and publishing policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and by engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties.</p>\n<p>We are presently litigating two cases against the U.S. government. One is on Section 6050I crypto tax reporting, <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-has-filed-a-court-challenge-against-the-treasury-dept-over-unconstitutional-financial-surveillance/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">pushing back against expanded warrantless financial surveillance</a>. The other is a civil case <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-is-suing-ofac-over-its-tornado-cash-sanction/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">challenging the U.S. Treasury Department’s designation of immutable smart contracts</a>. We argue that the Treasury does not have the statutory authority to add the Tornado Cash pool contracts to the list of sanctioned persons because immutable smart contracts are neither sanctioned persons themselves nor the property of any sanctioned person. We are fighting not only for the right of U.S. persons to continue using these tools but also seeking to set an important precedent: that the Treasury Department can’t simply identify decentralized apps and add them to the sanctions list without any evidence that the app is controlled by or enriches any sanctioned person.</p>\n<p>We are also coordinating with Roman Storm’s legal defense on an amicus brief in his criminal defense. Our amicus focuses on accurately describing the operation of Tornado Cash and the role that developers play in creating decentralized apps like Tornado Cash. We argue that publishing decentralized app software, both to the blockchain and to web servers, is not the kind of activity that can give rise to prohibitions under U.S. sanctions laws because (a) U.S. sanctions laws exclude from prohibitions any transactions for information or information materials and (b) the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment protects publishing software as “pure speech” warranting the strictest scrutiny from our courts.</p>\n<p>Finally, we are <a href=\"https://www.coincenter.org/blog/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">continuously engaged</a> in education and lobbying efforts in Congress and the various federal agencies in the U.S. to ensure that any changes to financial surveillance law does not impinge the free speech, privacy, and assembly rights of developers and users.</p>\n<p>A grant to Coin Center will be used to support our ongoing work and to contribute to the legal defense of developers facing criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>\n<p>In conclusion, the contributions mentioned above are not just a matter of protecting individual rights but a testament to our collective commitment to preserving the principles of innovation, decentralization, and individual sovereignty within the industry. By supporting this initiative, we affirm our dedication to upholding these principles and defending the right of developers to contribute to the deployment of permissionless open-source software without fear of reprisal or censorship.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>\n<p>We propose allocating up to 2.5 Million ARB to this endeavor; with delegates having a tripartite voting choice via weighted voting.</p>\n<p><strong>Voting</strong></p>\n<p>The ArbitrumDAO has the following options to vote for in relation to effecting its contribution Safeguarding Software Developers’ Rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fund CoinCenter with 1.5 Million ARB;</li>\n<li>Fund CoinCenter with 1.75 Million ARB;</li>\n<li>Fund CoinCenter with 2 Million ARB;</li>\n<li>Fund CoinCenter with 2.25 Million ARB;</li>\n<li>Fund CoinCenter with 2.5 Million ARB;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t Fund</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Discussions</strong></p>\n<p>A call will be held on Tuesday 09/04/2024 at 4PM UTC to discuss the proposal.</p>\n            <p><small>15 posts - 10 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-defending-open-source-a-united-stand-for-developer-rights-and-software-freedom/23047\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-defending-open-source-a-united-stand-for-developer-rights-and-software-freedom/23047","pubDate":"Thu, 04 Apr 2024 18:41:57 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-23047"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-defending-open-source-a-united-stand-for-developer-rights-and-software-freedom/23047.rss","#text":"Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Defending Open Source: A United Stand for Developer Rights and Software Freedom"},"filter":false},{"title":"Delegate Incentive Program Results (MARCH 2024)","dc:creator":"SEEDGov","category":"Governance","description":"<p>We are proud to announce the initial outcomes of the Delegate Incentive Program.

This rationale can be posted either in the delegate’s communication thread (if they have one) or in the proposal’s discussion thread itself. To adhere to best practices, we recommend that delegates communicate their voting intention and rationale as soon as possible after casting their vote.</p>\n<p>Examples of rationale communication:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Rationale posted in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gfx-labs-delegate-communication-thread/13794/32\">delegate’s communication thread </a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rationale posted in the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223/36\">proposal’s discussion thread </a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the voting process in the DAO, where voting typically first occurs on Snapshot and then on Tally, it’s understandable that delegates may keep the same voting stance in both stages. It’s reasonable for delegates not to issue a new rationale for the second stage if it was already provided during the first stage (Snapshot) and their position remains unchanged. <strong>In these cases, we simply expect delegates to indicate that they have maintained their vote based on the previously expressed rationale.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<h4><a name=\"orange_circle-commenting-in-proposals-7-cps-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#orange_circle-commenting-in-proposals-7-cps-6\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/orange_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":orange_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":orange_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Commenting in proposals (7 CPs)</h4>\n<p>It is important to clarify that for this parameter, only the number of Snapshots in the month is counted (11 in total for March), given that most of the debate is centered during the Snapshot period and not so much in tally.

This represents a big percentage of march’s Snapshot votings. This votations lacked the option ‘ABSTAIN’. So, some delegates expressed that they will not-cast their votes.</p>\n<p>One of these delegates was BlockworksResearch, expressing its concerns about this situation. After analyzing it, to solve this situation and prevent making changes on the karma dashboard that might be very complicated to executed, we decided to give an additional score as Bonus Points to those delegates that abstained to vote of the following 4 snapshots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x05e8fa22813e74fd6e5f3360fda4bb6388d0f85d4e6aef834acbb48451307b01\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC Research Member Election</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x9210912a0a77090d1407107dcb9143864aa6c1faa5c6ed9046b6a0a56bf6bbcc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC DAO Advocate Election</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3d41ffb43e44e83d004505e362e70f703aed0e740322e8ebfbb390d54724ca91\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC Security Member Election</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb04e968c2439cd68e429f722722944c960f82ce75d9f75efe8be52333e1d6554\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ARDC Risk Member Election</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to mention that voting in all snapshots of the months represents the 15% of the final score that a delegate can get each month. In this particular month there were 11 snapshots voting in total.</p>\n<p>If we make basic math (Rule of Three) :</p>\n<p><strong>11 Snapshot</strong> --------------------- <strong>15 % of SV</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1 Snapshot</strong> --------------------- X = <strong>1,3636 of SV%</strong></p>\n<p>And, if we consider the <strong>4</strong> Snapshots mentioned above:</p>\n<p><strong>1,3636</strong> of SV% x <strong>4 Snapshots</strong> = <strong>5,4545 %</strong></p>\n<p>So this <strong>5,4545 %</strong> is the bonus points that will be added to those delegates that abstained from voting on the ARDC Snapshots and expressed it in the forum.</p>\n<p>Of all delegates that form part of the program, only <strong>1</strong> delegate indicated that it would abstain.</p>\n<p>So this <strong>5,4545 %</strong> will be added as BP to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/blockworksresearch\">@BlockworksResearch</a></p>\n<p>Even this is not the ideal solution, our approach is that delegates participate in these votes by standing by their convictions. To avoid this in the near future, we will ensure that the ballots have the necessary options for delegates to express their voting intentions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"family_woman_woman_girl_boy-new-members-of-the-program-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#family_woman_woman_girl_boy-new-members-of-the-program-18\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/family_woman_woman_girl_boy.png?v=12\" title=\":family_woman_woman_girl_boy:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":family_woman_woman_girl_boy:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> New members of the program</h3>\n<p>As we said in previous posts, any delegate can <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945\">apply to the program anytime</a>.</p>\n<p>In fact, we have some new participants that will be part of it from the next month (APRIL):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/itublockchain/summary\">ITUblockchain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/ocandocrypto\">ocandocrypto.eth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo/summary\">Jojo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945/47\">Bobbay</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"police_car-security-council-elections-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#police_car-security-council-elections-19\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/police_car.png?v=12\" title=\":police_car:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":police_car:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Security Council Elections</h3>\n<p>When the proposal was written, security council elections were not considered.

The efforts have addressed several challenges and introduced key updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Handling On-chain Voting Complexities</strong>: The process of calculating accurate lifetime voting percentages for delegates was complicated by numerous canceled or invalid proposals. Adjusting for these anomalies was essential for reliability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Standardizing Voting Rationale Documentation</strong>: The absence of a uniform method for delegates to report their voting rationale—spread across proposal threads, delegate communication threads, and Snapshot—posed a significant challenge. Karma employed AI (Large Language Models) to efficiently extract these rationales from forum posts, streamlining administrative workflows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Archiving Delegate Activities</strong>: To ensure transparency and provide a historical perspective, Karma has begun archiving snapshots of all delegate activities, allowing for the review of monthly statistics by any interested party.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are continuing to make more updates to provide even more granular information.

Let us broadly call these instruments, targeted not only at healthy self sustainable returns, but ecosystem strategic objectives - Development Venture Capital or dVC.</p>\n<p>What a lot of the above stakeholders have figured out over decades of work is that even if you only care about the ecosystem impact, having it enabled via high growth for profit schemes produces by far the best impact. And on top of that, returns are generated allowing for sustainability and growth of the treasury enabling even more funds to be deployed. These characteristics more than justify the added setup complexity compared to grant schemes, where applicable. For clarity, Grant financing is still a crucial part of the whole value chain, especially for funding public goods and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>If Artibrum is able to rapidly leverage not only its progressive values and commitment to decentralized governance, but also the best in class talent and practices from more matured Developmental Venture Capital approaches in the Web2 world, it can jump ahead of the competition, attract the best builders, capital allocators, and ecosystem support players, thus setting the trend for others to follow.</p>\n<p>Given the complex landscape of Web3 verticals and market segments, as well as the varying needs of ventures across the stages of their lifecycle, resource allocation is best done through a multitude of specialized programs and instruments. Additionally, it’s best to partner with and support the emergent players of the ecosystem instead of trying to reinvent them top down, as this enables access to the talent, networks, market insights, and momentum of the emergent players. Thus enabling Arbitrum to move faster, with lower risk, and more cost effectively.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, Arbitrum needs to do this without allowing any of the partners or capital allocators to capture AVI and the DAO’s resources for their own exclusive gains, but rather use the capital in deep alignment with Arbitrum, generating win-win outcomes for Arbitrum, program operators, and projects.</p>\n<br>\n<h2><a name=\"key-considerations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-considerations-5\"></a>Key Considerations:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The structure should have an executive team that is able to operate at speed and provide a stakeholder friendly counterparty for GPs to negotiate with and raise money from Arbitrum as an LP.</li>\n<li>Potentially be able to get involved in direct investments or acting as a liquidity provider, but without competing with its main objective to attract a broad group of VCs and programs to operate in the ecosystem. Whether AVI should at all make direct investments or act as a liquidity provider is debatable and will require further exploration.</li>\n<li>Have an oversight committee that is elected by the DAO and includes key qualified representatives. These might include key Arbitrum DAO contributors and delegates, representatives of the Foundation and of key investors of Arbitrum with relevant competence, whose main vested interest is clearly the success of the chain above all else.</li>\n<li>The liquidation of Arb tokens, while they are being funnelled to be used in the venture ecosystem should be done under policies dictated by the DAO in alignment with avoiding causing undesirable price action. Furthermore concentration of such tokens in this substructure should not concentrate governance rights as a result of delegation by the small group of appointed executives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"case-studies-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#case-studies-6\"></a>Case Studies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The group referred to some of the many case studies from our experience in thread <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/what-do-we-want-for-arbitrum-venture-funds/22213\"><em>What do we want from Arbitrum Venture Funds</em></a>.

Thanksfully, we can use reference of the market. We should use leverage market-oriented approach. We have to focus on what market is already paying rewards among the Arbitrum-based infrastructure.</p>\n<p>L3. The market starts to pay attention to L3 narrative, finally. DEGEN, the strongest and the most organic BASE memecoin, adopts Arbitrum Orbit L3 solution for its own chain.

Full liquidation of collateral only happens if the price falls below this predetermined range.</p>\n<p>The goal of this proposal is to establish a deeply liquid borrowing and lending market for ARB tokens.

The novel soft-liquidation protects all users according to their risk appetite and helps to avoid liquidations.</p>\n<p>Soft-liquidation allows users to set a liquidation level close to the market price and leads to a more capital efficient way of using collateral.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"boosting-core-liquidity-for-arb-on-arbitrum-41\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#boosting-core-liquidity-for-arb-on-arbitrum-41\"></a>Boosting Core Liquidity for ARB on Arbitrum</h4>\n<p>Soft-liquidation is done over arbitrage with liquidity venues for ARB on Arbitrum. A deep crvUSD/ARB liquidity pool on Curve allows it to work smooth. The low gas fee on Arbitrum allows for more efficient soft-liquidation, as the arbitrageur doing the soft-liquidation has less gas cost to cover than on mainnet.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"sustaining-incentives-with-crv-emissions-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#sustaining-incentives-with-crv-emissions-42\"></a>Sustaining Incentives with CRV Emissions</h4>\n<p>A short-term incentive program runs the risk of seeing mass liquidity outflows after incentives end. Our goal is to jumpstart ARB lending market. As the soft-liquidation is far superior to the hard liquidation used in other lending markets, we are convinced users keep using the lending market if the incentive is tapering off.</p>\n<p>As we incentivize the supply side, the supply side earns lending reward from borrowers on top of the supply during bootstrapping and after bootstrapping.</p>\n<p>veCRV stakeholders will be motivated to continue allocating CRV emissions toward lending markets even after the ARB incentives end. CRV’s emission schedule lasts hundreds of years, giving Curve the means to incentivize liquidity on Arbitrum for years to come.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"execution-strategy-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#execution-strategy-43\"></a>Execution Strategy</h3>\n<h3><a name=\"how-the-grant-will-be-used-44\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-the-grant-will-be-used-44\"></a>How the grant will be used</h3>\n<p>The funds matched by the Arbitrum DAO will be used exclusively to bootstrap the supply side in the two ARB markets.

In the current market environment, there is more demand for leverage by depositing ARB as collateral and borrow crvUSD, than the opposite. Depending on the usage of these, the market’s ratio may shift from epoch to epoch.

It touches every piece of the stack and strengthens every integrated protocol. There is an opportunity for Arbitrum to leverage Curve’s foundational role to further support its vibrant ecosystem. Examples of how Curve spurs DeFi integration include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Soft-liquidation in Curve Lending markets is a feature many users are looking for.</li>\n<li>The stableswap algorithm, well known for enabling deep liquidity and low slippage swaps, has built a reputation for stabilizing pegs and enhancing stablecoin utility.  (e.g. FRAX, 3CRV)</li>\n<li>Curve has a number of integrations with lending markets, yield-bearing derivatives, and real-world assets. Swap fees compound the interest generated from these activities. (e.g. Aave, stETH, STBT)</li>\n<li>Highly configurable V2 pools are unlocking new potential for FX markets and volatile crypto pairs. The concentrated liquidity algorithm offers advantages to LPs and traders, combining a composable AMM design with low-slippage swaps. (e.g. Tricrypto, eursusd)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"how-we-achieve-stickiness-50\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#how-we-achieve-stickiness-50\"></a>How we achieve stickiness</h3>\n<p>After bootstrapping curve lending markets, part of the supplied asset will be borrowed to users which pay a market rate.

This enables developers to write smart contracts in new programming languages, like Rust, that are more efficient than Solidity smart contracts.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#motivation-3\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Stylus is a first-of-its-kind technology resulting from breakthrough engineering efforts in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Unlike other alternative VMs, Stylus is purely additive to the EVM. This means that Stylus contracts and EVM contracts are fully interoperable.</p>\n<p>Some defining features of Stylus include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Preferred Languages: There are <a href=\"https://research.slashdata.co/reports/65b90140343d024fbe70f369\">estimated</a> to be roughly 20k Solidity developers, compared to 3.5 million Rust developers and 10 million C++ developers. Developers can use their preferred programming language, all interoperable with each other, on any Arbitrum chain with Stylus. Scaling to the next billion users requires onboarding the next million developers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>EVM+: Stylus brings the best of both worlds. Developers still get all of the benefits of the EVM, including the ecosystem and liquidity, while getting efficiency improvements and access to existing libraries in Rust, C, and C++ — without changing anything about how the EVM works. EVM equivalence is no longer the ceiling; it’s the floor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cheaper Execution: Stylus is a more efficient execution environment than the EVM, leading directly to gas savings for complex smart contracts. Computation can be over 10x cheaper, and memory can be over 100x cheaper. Cryptography libraries can be deployed as custom application layer precompiles, permissionlessly. Use cases that are impractical in the EVM are now possible in Stylus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Safer By Design: Stylus doesn’t just improve on cost and speed. WASM programs are also safer. Reentrancy is a common vulnerability that developers can only attempt to mitigate in Solidity. Stylus provides cheap reentrancy detection, and using the Rust SDK, reentrancy is disabled by default, unless intentionally overridden.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fully Interoperable: Solidity programs and WASM programs are completely composable. If working in Solidity, a developer can call a Rust program or rely on another dependency in a different language. If working in Rust, all Solidity functionalities are accessible out of the box. This means your Rust smart contracts can rely on primitives and infrastructure (such as oracles) that were built using Solidity.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several exciting teams have been building their apps on the Stylus testnet for the past few months. These apps would simply not be possible on Arbitrum without the added efficiency or new language support. Stylus can onboard (1) the next generation of developers from alternate VM ecosystems and (2) new use cases that users cannot experience on EVM chains.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"rationale-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#rationale-4\"></a>Rationale</h2>\n<p>This proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s mission and values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Ethereum-Aligned: Stylus does not change anything about how the EVM works. Rather than replacing, Stylus is completely additive and extends what is possible in the EVM.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sustainable: More efficiency at the execution layer can give Arbitrum chains long-term competitive advantages by allowing higher throughput, cheaper costs, and new use cases that are not possible on other EVM chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accessibility: Arbitrum can become the home for new types of developers who don’t know Solidity. This includes Rust, C, C++, and any other programming language that compiles to WebAssembly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inclusivity: The Stylus SDK is 100% open-source, meaning developers are free to fork, modify, and contribute to the core patterns that the SDK represents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Empowerment: The parameters defined in Stylus are fully configurable by the Arbitrum DAO (for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) and individual Orbit chains. These customizations can supercharge Stylus by, for example, dropping activation prices, increasing contract size limits, and lowering opcode pricing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"key-terms-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-terms-5\"></a>Key Terms</h2>\n<p>Stylus: A new programming environment, including a WebAssembly-based virtual machine, a CLI, and a canonical SDK that defines the patterns and frameworks for writing smart contracts.</p>\n<p>WebAssembly (WASM): WebAssembly is a modern binary format used in significant web standards, browsers, and companies to speed up computation. Built to be fast, portable, and secure.</p>\n<p>Virtual Machine (VM): The software that executes smart contracts and processes transactions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"specifications-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#specifications-6\"></a>Specifications</h2>\n<p>The Stylus VM and fraud prover have been developed as a fork of the Nitro codebase. These repositories will be merged into the main branch of Nitro if the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stylus: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus: Stylus VM and Fraud Prover</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Fork of <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro: Nitro goes vroom and fixes everything</a></li>\n<li>Includes node software, VM, and Fraud Prover</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>stylus-geth: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-geth\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-geth</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Fork of <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/go-ethereum</a></li>\n<li>Includes the execution client and databases</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>stylus-contracts: <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Fork of <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts\" class=\"inline-onebox\">GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts: The core Arbitrum Nitro contracts deployed to the base chain to host the rollup</a></li>\n<li>Includes rollup and fraud proof smart contracts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Stylus VM is not a replacement for the EVM. Instead, the two VMs work together to facilitate state transitions, each playing their part in executing their respective bytecode. EVM contracts written in Solidity still use Geth’s EVM exactly as before, ensuring EVM equivalence. In other words, Stylus is entirely additive — a paradigm called EVM+.</p>\n<p>Stylus contracts can be written using the Stylus SDK, which employs Solidity-equivalent ABIs and storage patterns to ensure cross-language interoperability. For example, existing Solidity DEXs can list Rust tokens without modification. New SDKs for additional programming languages can be added over time.

For example, a contract might query the runtime for information about its balance, emit logs, or even call out to other contracts. In these cases the Stylus VM provides Host Input / Output operations, aka Host I/Os, for interacting with the contract’s environment. They are called via standard WASM ABI, which means they are available in all programming languages. For standardization purposes, types are also denoted in Rust form, which can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/stylus/stylus-sdk/src/hostio.rs\">SDK</a>. Some host I/Os require accessing the EVM, which cannot be implemented entirely on the Rust side. For these, a special system of callbacks (an API) connects Rust to Go.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"the-memory-model-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#the-memory-model-8\"></a>The Memory Model</h4>\n<p>Stylus introduces a novel VM that provides an opportunity to improve upon the EVM’s quadratic memory model. Rather than using a per-call quadratic memory model, Stylus programs use a global, exponential memory pricing policy. The maximum memory footprint per block is currently set to 8 MB. This footprint reflects all programs ever executed during a transaction rather than being isolated to a per-call-context basis and does not include EVM contracts.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"dynamic-linking-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#dynamic-linking-9\"></a>Dynamic Linking</h4>\n<p>Proving fraud over untrusted WASMs presents novel challenges to the design of the dispute protocol. Arbitrum fraud proofs consist of two phases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The bisection protocol, wherein the parties narrow down to a single WAVM opcode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The One Step Proof, wherein L1 contracts emulate that single instruction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stylus does not change the bisection protocol or its implementation. All changes are compatible with <a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum-chains-9934eb5328cc\">BOLD</a> and the current system. However, there is one conceptual difference: instead of bisecting over the vanilla replay machine’s execution of a block, user programs are dynamically linked in and out throughout execution.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"activation-pricing-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#activation-pricing-10\"></a>Activation Pricing</h4>\n<p>There are two primary costs when activating user programs: compute and storage.</p>\n<p>Activated Stylus programs expire after 1 year. The original compressed WASM is kept around for future reactivation. Like all Stylus parameters, the Arbitrum DAO can configure this expiration period. This policy has two benefits. First, it decreases state bloat by only keeping information necessary for the long term, pruning short-lived contracts over time. Second, the Stylus VM can charge less for activated contract code. Today, the EVM charges 200 gas per byte of contract code, which makes sense for permanent state, but leaves an opportunity to cut costs for Stylus.</p>\n<p>The Stylus VM provides 120Mb of temporary storage per hour for activated contract code. If demand for this temporary storage exceeds this limit, the price rises, eventually to a value that exceeds 200 gas per byte.</p>\n<p>Stylus is designed to withstand powerful adversaries that can censor Ethereum for up to a week, buy the entirety of Arbitrum’s blockspace indefinitely, or similar worst-case assumptions. Stylus defaults to a configuration intended for this extreme environment, with generous error margins usually exceeding 100%.</p>\n<p>Under this configuration, nodes will never exceed 1TB of activated contract code. In practice, the state size will be over an order of magnitude smaller, due to the generous error margins used and realistic user demand.</p>\n<p>Along with the data fee for temporary storage, users must also pay for compute when activating a program. This compute component pays for the work done instrumenting the contract and lowering it to the node’s local assembly. For most contracts, this is about 2 million gas, though in some unusual circumstances, the costs may be higher.</p>\n<p>This means deploying a Stylus contract end-to-end will generally cost more than in the EVM. However this is only true for the first time a contract is deployed. If multiple contracts share the same code hash, only the first needs to pay for activation. Additionally, for most onchain applications, these economics work out since after a contract has been activated, compute becomes over an order of magnitude cheaper than in the EVM.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"opcode-pricing-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#opcode-pricing-11\"></a>Opcode Pricing</h4>\n<p>Opcode pricing is similar to activation: each opcode takes an amount of time to run, the length of which determines the price. Unlike activation, opcode execution is measured in fractions of a nanosecond and is highly variable. This pricing table for opcodes is informed by the benchmarking numbers found via the <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/tree/stylus-pricer-benchmarks/arbitrator/tools/pricers/benchmarks\">benchmarks</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/tree/stylus-pricer-benchmarks/arbitrator/tools/pricers/runtime\">runtime</a> crates of the aforementioned ‘stylus-pricer-benchmarks’ branch. Another way pricing has been checked for correctness is by generating trillions of gas worth of instructions and then trying to sync nodes from scratch. In practice, on representative hardware, it was found that almost 360 million gas per second can be synced, or 50x faster than our current speed limit. This implies many opcodes are being overcharged, the prices of which can drop over time as confidence is gained in the model.</p>\n<p>Host I/O pricing is more straightforward. Through benchmarking and static analysis, clear bounds on VM affordances can be determined. This <a href=\"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/stylus/arbitrator/stylus/src/test/timings.rs\">file</a> benchmarks all the Rust-only Host I/Os.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"steps-to-implement-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#steps-to-implement-12\"></a>Steps to Implement</h2>\n<p>If the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discussion of the proposal on the forum</li>\n<li>Completing the audit and remaining code changes</li>\n<li>A vote on Snapshot to enable Stylus on Arbitrum Sepolia</li>\n<li>Merging the Stylus branch into the canonical Nitro codebase</li>\n<li>Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet that emulates production environments</li>\n<li>An onchain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"timeline-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#timeline-13\"></a>Timeline</h2>\n<p>Stylus is rapidly progressing toward being production-ready. Once it is, ideally the upgrade can take place on Arbitrum Sepolia, and Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova afterwards. An onchain vote for this AIP will only occur once there is a public audit report.</p>\n            <p><small>13 posts - 13 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a

href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#kpi-liquidity-growth-and-retention-6\"></a><strong>KPI: Liquidity Growth and Retention</strong></h2>\n<p>The STIP for Trader Joe aimed to boost liquidity pools with incentives over 28 days and assess retention in the following 28 days. The hypothesis was that initial high rewards could elevate liquidity to self-sustaining levels post-incentive. Overall, the data indicates that while liquidity levels remained satisfactory in most pools immediately after the incentive period, only four pools failed to meet the targeted KPIs. However, in the absence of further incentives and facing increased yield competition, most pools saw diminished activity over the extended period post incentives.</p>\n<p>In summary, while the strategy successfully attracted liquidity, maintaining liquidity without incentives past a 28 day period proved to be a challenge in the context of competitive yield opportunities elsewhere. This outcome validates the original hypothesis to some extent—that retaining liquidity is feasible without incentives over a period of time. However, that period of time largely depends on the dynamics of yield competition across the ecosystem. These are valuable learnings, moving forward.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Token</th>\n<th>Liquidity Pre Incentives</th>\n<th>Peak TVL During Incentives</th>\n<th>Average

This proposal intends to set up this subsidy fund, seeking $10 million worth of ARB to be administered and selected by the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ADPC’) to facilitate the selection of projects that will benefit from the whitelisted security audit service providers selected via the ADPC’s procurement framework. The ultimate decision will be made by the ADPC based on the Means Test and the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYCtfP_GqfjkKQafVr86hCpjEsQ2Ec4a/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Application Process Terms</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"proposal-request-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#proposal-request-3\"></a>Proposal Request</h1>\n<p>We propose the creation of a procurement subsidy fund allocating $10 million worth of ARB to provide financial assistance to both new and existing projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>These subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees. This approach eliminates the need for the ADPC to assess the reasonableness of funds requests.</p>\n<p>The aim of the subsidy fund is to incentivise participation and growth among smaller projects helping them to overcome barriers to entry, such as challenges to acquire funding to pay for the cost of robust security audits.</p>\n<p>The figure of $10 million worth of ARB has been determined via a benchmarking exercise conducted with various security audit service providers. This <a href=\"https://noteforms.com/forms/subsidy-fund-service-fee-consultation-mtg039\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">form</a> was shared with these service providers and based on the responses of 10 service providers (including the likes of Spearbit, Halborn, Nethermind, Three Sigma, Guardian, Zellic, etc.) on their scope of services and fees associated, we have estimated that each project will require a 2-month security audit at an average cost of $200K. This will enable the ADPC to potentially fund up to 50 projects; however, it should be noted that the average of $200K is an estimate and fees are usually specific to each project, each project requires a scoping exercise, and audit costs will vary based on the size of the codebase, complexity, etc.</p>\n<p>Any feedback on this proposal is encouraged via a public discussion on the community forum.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"subsidy-fund-design-approach-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#subsidy-fund-design-approach-4\"></a>Subsidy Fund Design &amp; Approach</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"exec-view-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#exec-view-5\"></a>Exec View</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>$10 million worth of ARB allocated across ~50 projects to spend on whitelisted security audit service providers, with an average amount of $200K worth of ARB allocated per project and a max cap of $500K per project.</li>\n<li>ADPC responsible for selection and oversight.</li>\n<li>Our aim is to distribute the Subsidy Fund in an 8-month period, in 4 cohorts of 8 weeks each.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"key-pillars-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#key-pillars-6\"></a>Key Pillars</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"a-subsidy-fund-principles-and-criteria-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#a-subsidy-fund-principles-and-criteria-7\"></a>(A) Subsidy Fund Principles and Criteria</h3>\n<p><strong>Core Principles Underlying the ADPC Subsidy Fund</strong></p>\n<p>Before considering a subsidy application, applicants should carefully evaluate the need for support. The purpose of these guidelines is to clarify the subsidy program and make the process as straightforward as possible.</p>\n<p>All applicants should keep in mind the following key principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Transparency &amp; integrity</strong> - Applicants must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and receipt of any prior funding.</li>\n<li><strong>Encouragement of investment</strong> - Subsidies should incentivise investment that would not otherwise occur without the subsidy. They should not cover costs that the beneficiary would have funded independently in the absence of any subsidy.</li>\n<li><strong>Proportionate and necessary</strong> - Subsidies should be proportionate to their intended objective and limited to what is necessary to achieve it.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic neutrality</strong> - The requested subsidy amount should not confer an economic advantage. It should be provided on fair terms, comparable to what could reasonably be obtained on the market.</li>\n<li><strong>Consideration of funding options</strong> - Applicants are expected to explore all available funding options and responsibly choose the option that best suits their needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement of beneficiary security</strong> - Subsidies should bring about changes that enhance the security of the beneficiary’s protocol.</li>\n<li><strong>Positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem</strong> - Subsidies should have a beneficial effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem, contributing to its growth and sustainability.</li>\n<li><strong>Value for Money</strong> - The evaluation method should ensure decisions maximize both financial and non-financial value to Arbitrum.</li>\n<li><strong>Probity</strong> - Subsidies should be issued in an environment that ensures fairness, impartiality, and compliance with established guidelines and rules. There will be an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and integrity throughout the procurement process, evidenced by the development of this publicly documented Means Test methodology. This focus on Probity will mitigate procurement risks and safeguard the integrity of the procurement process.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Management</strong> - Risk management policies will be implemented to identify and mitigate procurement risks.</li>\n<li><strong>Engagement with SMEs</strong> - We have invited a wide range of organisations to participate, all of whom will be subject to the eligibility criteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Cyclical Whitelist events</strong> - We will have clear rules for cyclical whitelist reviews to open a pathway for future applicants and new market entrants.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Means Test: Criteria for Evaluation</p>\n<p>The reason for this approach over a purely quantitative approach is that most projects, especially the smaller ones being targeted within this subsidy program do not possess obvious immediately measurable metrics.</p>\n<p>The development of this Means Test aims to provide a structured approach for the ADPC to evaluate applications for financial assistance. This tool is designed to identify applicants who would benefit most from support, ensuring equitable access to subsidies within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, particularly for smaller entities with valuable contributions.</p>\n<p>The intent is to allocate subsidies to those most in need, avoiding exploitation by larger players looking for a ‘free lunch/handout’. Such an event could give recipients an unfair advantage over their competitors or be an inefficient use of the DAO’s funds if they do not bring about a net positive change.</p>\n<p>The means test will include a scoring system ranging from 1 to 5, reflecting the merit of each application.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rating 1: Unsatisfactory</li>\n<li>Rating 2: Below expectations</li>\n<li>Rating 3: Meets expectations</li>\n<li>Rating 4: Above expectations</li>\n<li>Rating 5: Exceptional</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the sub-criteria in the means test have varying levels of importance, and they will each have a weighting attached. A weighting of 1 indicates low importance, 2 indicates neutral importance, and 3 indicates high importance.</p>\n<p>Each application will be scored by ADPC members, followed by a collective decision on the most deserving grant recipients, taking into account the rating against the eligibility criteria, a value-for-money evaluation and the funds available. The ADPC may make other decisions in relation to the operation of the fund and selection of applicants as further detailed in the Application Process Terms.</p>\n<p>After the applications have been reviewed and decisions taken as to the grant beneficiaries, the average score assigned to each project will be shared publicly, ensuring that transparency is maintained throughout the process. In the event that an applicant receives a high score but is not chosen as a grant recipient, explanatory feedback will be provided either on an individual or collective basis to the cohort.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Criteria</th>\n<th>Sub-Criteria</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Weight</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Arbitrum Ecosystem Contribution</strong><br><em>How aligned is the project with the Arbitrum ecosystem and how easy will it be to track the applicant’s use of the subsidy funds?</em></td>\n<td>Ecosystem Contribution</td>\n<td>How does the applicant’s project contribute towards the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Transparency Practices</td>\n<td>To what extent does the applicant demonstrate transparency in its operations?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Community Engagement</td>\n<td>How does the applicant engage with the DAO community and solicit feedback/input on its project, incorporating this into its decision-making?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Accountability Measures</td>\n<td>What mechanisms does the project have in place to ensure accountability and responsible stewardship of subsidy funds, including governance structures in place?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Business Model &amp; Need for the Subsidy</strong><br><em>How effectively does the applicant’s business model align with their need for the subsidy?</em></td>\n<td>Clarity of Business Model</td>\n<td>How well-defined and understandable is the applicant’s business model?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Team Experience</td>\n<td>What is the track record of the team on their ability to execute their plan?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Funding Gap Rationale</td>\n<td>Is there a clear explanation of the funding gap the applicant is facing, along with the rationale for why additional subsidy funding is necessary to achieve its objectives?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Reasonableness of Subsidy Amount Requested</td>\n<td>Does the requested subsidy amount make sense within the context of the project’s needs and potential impact?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Scalability Potential</td>\n<td>What is the scalability potential of the applicant’s business model following the support of the subsidy?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Financial Analysis</strong><br><em>How realistic and stress tested is the applicant’s financial status and projections and is their plan for the use of the subsidy funds clearly outlined?</em></td>\n<td>Accuracy of Projections</td>\n<td>How realistic and well-supported are the financial projections provided by the applicant, inclusive of revenue forecasts and cost analysis?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Sensitivity to Scenarios</td>\n<td>To what extent does the applicant’s financial analysis consider different scenarios, such as base, target and stress scenarios to assess the projects’ resilience and adaptability to changing market conditions?</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>KPIs</td>\n<td>Are there clearly defined KPIs that will be used to track the project’s performance and measure progress towards achieving its goals?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Preferred Funding Distribution</td>\n<td>Does the applicant have a preferred distribution plan for the subsidy funds, and is there a rationale provided for this distribution approach, such as front-loading funds for critical start-up costs or phased funding based on project milestones?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Risk Analysis</strong><br><em>Is the applicant aware of risks with their project and what is their plan for mitigating these risks?</em></td>\n<td>Risk Identification</td>\n<td>How effectively does the applicant identify and assess potential risks and vulnerabilities that the project may have?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Security Requirements</td>\n<td>Does the applicant have a clear understanding of its security requirements and the measures needed to protect against security breaches, such as through the conducting of a security audit?</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Mitigation Strategies</td>\n<td>What strategies does the applicant have in place or intend to implement to safeguard against the aforementioned risks?</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Regarding the ‘Ecosystem Contribution’ metric above, we have conducted an initial assessment of the types of projects that are currently building in the Arbitrum ecosystem and identified a few verticals that the ecosystem would benefit from funding.

Each cohort will consist of an initial submission period of 2 weeks, followed by a 6-week review period. Moreover, a maximum cap of 25% of the total Subsidy Fund amount can be disbursed per cohort to ensure that the fund is structured to allow the door to be opened to new entrants over time. Each cohort will operate on a first-come-first-served basis for application reviews, and if the maximum capital has been allocated for the cohort, the remaining applicants will be rolled over to the next cohort.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Screening</strong></p>\n<p>To efficiently handle the anticipated surge in applications and to ensure that the highest quality and most relevant applicants are selected, the below 5 sub-criteria (with the highest weights as mentioned above in the Means Test) will first be applied to all applicants, with the top-scoring applicants moving forward in the evaluation process and being assessed in greater depth:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Funding Gap Rationale</li>\n<li>Reasonableness of Subsidy Amount Requested</li>\n<li>KPIs</li>\n<li>Ecosystem Contribution</li>\n<li>Accountability Measures</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The ADPC reserves the right to introduce Mandatory Requirements over time that operate as threshold tests and will publish those requirements if introduced.</p>\n<p><strong>In-Depth Review &amp; Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Projects that pass the initial screening will undergo a review due diligence (DD) by the ADPC, including interviews and constructive feedback (either individually or on a collective basis).</p>\n<p><strong>Award &amp; Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>Once approved, projects receive subsidies, with periodic check-ins and a concluding evaluation to measure impact and success.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"c-selection-process-reporting-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#c-selection-process-reporting-9\"></a>(C) Selection Process &amp; Reporting</h3>\n<p>Transparency and continuous dialogue form the backbone of our selection and reporting process, ensuring that each funded project remains aligned with program expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Bi-Monthly Reports</strong></p>\n<p>We will provide bi-monthly updates on our selections and updates on funded projects (i.e., in line with each Cohort). These updates will include general project trajectory and progress toward milestones. To create the reports we will set regular monthly check-in dates where projects fill a template/slide in order to give the key info about the project’s status, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Summary of Achievements for the Month</li>\n<li>Funds Utilized</li>\n<li>Milestones Reached</li>\n<li>Challenges Faced &amp; Plan of Action</li>\n<li>Feedback Integration, i.e., how projects have incorporated feedback provided.</li>\n<li>Next Steps &amp; Priorities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Output Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>With the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for meaningful output will look as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Number of Projects Funded:</strong> Number of projects funded during each cohort.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Funds Allocated:</strong> Cumulative sum of funds distributed in each cohort, showcasing the program’s financial impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Percentage of projects funded in target verticals:</strong> As outlined in the Means Test, the three key verticals we have identified are RWAs &amp; Tokenization, Gaming, and Collab Tech.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcome Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on the final portfolio of funded projects, we will gauge the success rate of awarded projects through specific outcome metrics. While these metrics can be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as market conditions and individual decisions on a project level, we are committed to supporting and funding the most promising projects to the best of our ability. Metrics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Percentage of funded projects successfully deployed on Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Percentage of KPIs outlined in the application achieved by funded projects</li>\n<li>Percentage of projects successfully deployed as Orbit chains: One of the key aims of the Arbitrum DAO is to build and expand the Orbit ecosystem. Funding projects that grow the Orbit ecosystem is a net positive to the DAO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"d-project-allocation-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#d-project-allocation-10\"></a>(D) Project Allocation</h3>\n<p>Our approach to subsidy fund allocation focuses on achieving high impact while ensuring that a de minimus number of projects obtain funding.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the subsidy is spread across a large number of projects rather than concentrated in several larger projects, the maximum subsidy to be granted will comprise 5% of the subsidy fund available. Therefore, given that the subsidy fund comprises $10 million, the maximum subsidy that a project can receive will comprise no more than $500K worth of ARB. This will ensure that the fund is designed to subsidize at least 20 projects, at a minimum.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"e-team-setup-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#e-team-setup-11\"></a>(E) Team Setup</h3>\n<p>The administration and selection process of these subsidies will be managed by the ADPC. Even though the ultimate decision will lie with the judgment of the ADPC, their assessment will be strongly guided by a means test that evaluates key metrics to determine deserving projects.</p>\n<p>The activation of the ADPC to manage the Subsidy Fund will hinge on extending the current 6-month mandate once the Subsidy Fund becomes operational. Should the DAO or the ADPC opt against a continuation of the ADPC, a Subsidy Fund Management Committee will need to be elected. The ADPC will allocate ample time for this process to ensure the Subsidy Fund operation is not reliant on the ADPC’s mandate extension.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"g-governance-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation#g-governance-12\"></a>(G) Governance</h3>\n<p>The Subsidy Fund governance aims for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement. It outlines mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced decision-making for all stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Sig</strong></p>\n<p>All providers must undergo and successfully complete the standard Know-Your-Business (hereinafter referred to as the ‘KYB’) verification processes with the Arbitrum Foundation prior to receiving the service-subsidy.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the designated Multi-sig members, established at the inception of the ADPC and voted in favour of by the ArbitrumDAO, will take charge of disbursing funds to the selected beneficiaries, whereby the transactions will be streamed using Hedgey.</p>\n<p>In recognition of the additional responsibilities undertaken, each of the five multi-sig wallets is proposed to receive a supplementary compensation ranging from 500 ARB - 1,000 ARB monthly.</p>\n<p>It is also important to note, as per the ratified proposal which led to the formation of the ADPC, that the multi-sig committee grants the ArbitrumDAO the authority to claw back funds from the ADPC’s multi-sig wallet using the <a href=\"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-procurement-clawback-capability\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Zodiac Governor Module</a>, if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Checks &amp; Balances</strong></p>\n<p>Kindly note that the subsidy fund will be subject to the same checks and balances found within the <a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064\">procurement committee proposal</a>, regulated by an agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members, with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the agreement. These checks and balances include:</p>\n<p><strong>Conflict of Interest Provision:</strong> ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position &amp; disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Members’ involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.</p>\n<p>To sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Record-keeping and Reporting:</strong> Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress &amp; internal ADPC Administration.</p>\n<p><strong>Duty of Impartiality:</strong> ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks &amp; workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.</p>\n<p><strong>Obligation of Recusal:</strong> ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project and/or service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation &amp; administration of the applicable procurement process.</p>\n<p>P<strong>rohibition of Self-Dealing:</strong> Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethical Trading:</strong> Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Application Terms and Conditions can be found</strong> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYCtfP_GqfjkKQafVr86hCpjEsQ2Ec4a/view\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>CCing: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer\">@Immutablelawyer</a>; <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/pablo\">@Pablo</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/sid_areta\">@sid_areta</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cliffton.eth\">@cliffton.eth</a>, <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/raam\">@raam</a></p>\n            <p><small>12 posts - 8 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Apr 2024 20:58:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"forum.arbitrum.foundation-topic-22958"},"source":{"@url":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958.rss","#text":"[Non-constitutional] Subsidy Fund for Security Services"},"filter":false},{"title":"# Thank ARB monthly report: February 2024","dc:creator":"BenWest","category":"Grants Discussions","description":"<p>Hi, this is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benwest\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Ben West</a>, I will be working with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/disruptionjoe\">@DisruptionJoe</a> and the team to deliver the Thank ARB program.
