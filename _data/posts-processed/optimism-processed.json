In this report, we reflect on the challenges faced during Cycle 25.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that the fast-paced review process and some export issues with Charmverse limited our ability to provide comprehensive feedback. We are addressing this issue with the Charmverse team and have decided to push all non-approved applications to the next cycle to allow them to incorporate the feedback. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JpJK5AyOqqd2_LT8CmnX5yDKGd1UM6ebV3Af-PGdU3s/edit?usp=sharing\">Badly formatted comments here until further notice.</a></p>\n<p>For the next cycle, submission is always open, with a deadline at the end of the first week (intake) on Tuesday. Applications submitted after this deadline will be considered for the following cycle.</p>\n<p>We received 50 applications and managed to review 100% of them at each milestone. However, due to time constraints, only three reviewers had full context for final decision-making. To resolve this, we will divide the review process into two groups of six Grants Council members each.</p>\n<p>The Developer Advisory Board provided valuable feedback during the final review, but we understand that incorporating it in just 24 hours was insufficient. Going forward, we will provide preliminary review lists earlier to allow applicants and reviewers more time to consider DAB feedback.</p>\n<p>We want to thank the DAB for their prompt and precise input. At this point, no applications have been declined unless mission requests are fulfilled. Applications not approved will be carried over to the next cycle for additional review by three more Grants Council members.</p>\n<p>To Superchain grant applicants: We appreciate your interest in our program and apologize for any inconvenience caused by the postponement of decision-making to the next cycle. This allows us more time to thoroughly evaluate applications. We encourage you to refine your proposals and address areas of improvement identified by reviewers.</p>\n<p>In detail, scores are here <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AcVf-8SjZchG11krE64YCrz8KWZ5f6CW_mWJUk5z6YE/edit?usp=sharing\">Grants Council public database</a></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Application</th>\n<th>Scores (Avg)</th>\n<th>Resolution</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>INTENT 1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cross Chain Voting</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aragon &lt;&gt; RISC Zero -

And I look forward to applying these diverse experiences to keep Optimism humming smoothly. In my opinion, good visibility and strong proactive communication are table stakes. No system is perfect, and we should expect occasional failures. A good defense-in-depth strategy allows us to mitigate the downsides of failures, giving us the room to diagnose systemic issues.

Once implemented, this ZKP can reduce the challenge period for Optimism from 7 days to 12 hours and avoid complicated interactive challenge procedures. Optimism accepted and funded three proposals from Risc Zero, O(1) Labs, and the ETH Storage team. Each team proposes a similar approach, where the fault proof program, written in Go or Rust, is compiled into a generic instruction set such as RISCV, WASM, or MIPS. These compiled instructions are then verified for correctness using zkVMs like zkRISCV, zkWASM, or zkMIPS, which we refer to as the generic VM approach. An alternative approach involves developing a custom circuit for the fault proof program, which we believe offers better performance compared to the generalized VM method. Recently, Polygon Zero announced the development of a highly performant type1 zkEVM, which aligns with our expectations for creating a custom circuit for opBNB’s fault proof program. Therefore, we have decided to develop a proof of concept (PoC) based on Polygon Zero’s type1 zkEVM codebase to demonstrate the performance advantages compared to the generalized VM approach. The PoC involves the protocol specific to Optimism, and can be used to generate ZKP for Optimism blocks. The figure below illustrates the simple workflow of the two approaches. It is worth noting that our proposal aims not only to improve performance but also to enhance the robustness of the Optimism multi-proofs system.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vi6DVyZIjKqoMYUlBCrHhYFUrA7.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b_2_669x500.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"vi6DVyZIjKqoMYUlBCrHhYFUrA7\" width=\"669\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b_2_669x500.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/d/db4f62214528e7ec322c58f9f4116eeace10f13b.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F5F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"current-fault-proof-overview-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#current-fault-proof-overview-2\"></a>Current Fault Proof Overview</h3>\n<p>Before delving into the ZK fault proof design, Let’s quickly review the current optimism fault proof design.</p>\n<p>The offchain fault proof program consists of two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Derive the disputed block from the anchor L1 block hash;</li>\n<li>Execute the disputed block based on the agreed L2 state root and compare the execution result with the claimed output root</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The onchain fault dispute game works as following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The attacker and defender take turns initiating on-chain actions based on the claims submitted on-chain by their opponents until they agree on the disputed L2 block;</li>\n<li>They then repeat the above challenge process until they agree on the disputed instruction of the off-chain fault proof program, which uses the disputed L2 block as the input;</li>\n<li>Then invoke the on-chain MIPS contract to execute the disputed instruction which will determine the winner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above fault proof design has following disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The attacker or defender needs to send many on-chain transactions, resulting in significant gas cost;</li>\n<li>The attacker or defender is susceptible to <a href=\"https://kelvinfichter.com/pages/thoughts/challenge-periods/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">censorship attacks</a>, where transactions become harder to include in the L1 chain due to congestion created by either party.

The adoption work we have done is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the gas fee calculation mechanism according to Optimism/opBNB protocol;</li>\n<li>Optimism/opBNB transaction fees consist of two components: the Execution Gas Fee and the L1 Data Fee. The Execution Gas Fee covers the cost of executing transactions on L2, similar to Ethereum’s gas fee. The L1 Data Fee covers the cost of publishing L2 transaction data on Ethereum.

There are two kinds of deposited transactions: L1 attributes deposited transaction (submits the L1 block’s attributes to the L1 Attributes Pre-deployed Contract) and User deposited transactions (transactions derived from an L1 call to the deposit contract).

An Optimism quality standard would give third parties an understandable means to trust the software of the L2/3 of the Superchain. This forum post is looking for support from the Optimism community for this idea. Even if funded, without active support from the Optimism community any quality standard would simply be an easily ignored set of documents.  But creating this standard Optimism shows maturity and the advantages to using the OP Stack.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this forum post is to test if there is interest in proceeding further.</p>\n<p>Why develop a quality standard now?</p>\n<p>Imagine the question “Which is safer, Base, Blast, Mode or OP?”  The answer should be simple, they are all safe as they are all based on the same OP Stack.  Instead, this one question drives 100 unanswered questions. How do you define safe? What version of OP Stack are they running? Is it the latest? Did they make changes on it? Did they test those changes? Should they? Why does the website and docs not address any of these questions? All of this makes the safety of the chains a question mark when it should be clear and transparent.</p>\n<p>A quality standard would answer all of these questions in a simple, clear and auditable way. It would give Superchains the incentive to do the boring but not excessive effort to prove they meet the quality standard.</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking what are the steps?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Build a quality standard</li>\n<li>Get support from 3rd parties (protocols, bridges, insurance groups) that would prefer chains that use the standard</li>\n<li>Have the standard approved via an OP vote</li>\n<li>Build a OP doc set so that Superchains understand the steps to take and how to show they are following them.</li>\n<li>Implementing the standard is optional, but if 3rd parties show advantages, the whole thing should be accepted by the chains.</li>\n<li>Update and improve the standard as time goes by</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since I started DeFiSafety in 2020, I have been reviewing DeFi protocols on best practices and transparency.  So quality standards in DeFi has been my full time activity for four years.  I have found that on my own my impact is limited.

We’re eager to start but have encountered a challenge with project selection.</p>\n<p>In the first version of the proposal, we proposed to handle vetting projects ourselves. During the review process, the reviewers asked for a change so that the Grants Council does the selection instead (see <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/bleu-builders/link_to_proposal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">approved proposal</a>), which got incorporated into our final grant scope. Despite the grant’s approval, though, we haven’t received any project assignments from the Grants Council so far.</p>\n<p>We understand that the Grants Council is currently managing a high workload, which may have contributed to the delay in project assignments. Given this situation, we reached out to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth\">@gonna.eth</a> to discuss potential solutions, and he proposed.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposed-approach-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#proposed-approach-2\"></a>Proposed Approach</h2>\n<p>After discussing with <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth\">@gonna.eth</a>, he proposed an alternative that doesn’t require the Grants Council’s direct involvement given their current workload:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>50% of our services to existing grantees</li>\n<li>50% to projects we select independently, based off the selection criteria below</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We like this suggestion because it potentially allows us to start working promptly, supporting both vetted grantees and new initiatives without additional Grants Council intervention.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"considerations-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#considerations-3\"></a>Considerations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Selecting and negotiating with projects will require time that wasn’t accounted for in the original grant.

We want to ensure this change aligns with the community’s expectations and Optimism’s governance standards, hence why this forum post.</li>\n<li>The 50/50 split is not based on any specific reason.

Delegates, other Internal Groups and Collective Members who wish to raise potential issues can also utilize the template for “<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hunS5p3hH52zOlWxB7o7umIyrTNzNXBuYZ97xDrqdT4/edit#heading=h.2yoqch3648gp\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Expression of Concern</a>” to provide additional context on their issue and why it should be flagged and voted on by the ACC.</li>\n<li>To progress towards a Snapshot vote, approval from four ACC members is required. The ACC members who wish to approve a potential issue can indicate the same to the ACC Lead.</li>\n<li>Once at least 4 members of ACC have provided their approval on a potential issue, the ACC will file a report with the Citizens’ House, and simultaneously conduct an internal vote on Snapshot. Based on the consensus of the Snapshot vote, the Anticapture Commission will cast the official vote as an onchain transaction directly on Optimism Agora using the ACC multisig.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"h-54-transparency-in-decision-making-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-54-transparency-in-decision-making-16\"></a>5.4 Transparency in Decision-Making</h3>\n<p>Public communication of Anticapture Commission Reports under review and rationale for decisions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"h-6-logistical-operations-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-6-logistical-operations-17\"></a>6.

In December, the Optimism Foundation moved away from Fractal as an identity verification provider and stopped using them for most users and geographies. This move was spurred by community provided feedback that the process felt unnecessarily thorough. We are currently using Persona to satisfy our identity verification requirements as a component of KYC. You can read about their successful completion of key privacy and security audits here: <a href=\"https://withpersona.com/security\">https://withpersona.com/security</a>.</p>\n<p>While we are still waiting to learn more from Fractal about the nature of the breach, their team has confirmed that <strong>five Optimism users were impacted</strong>. Breached data did <strong>not</strong> include any direct association between a user’s personal identifying information and a team’s Optimism grant awards, nor their L1 or L2 addresses in use for grant awards. Email or other contact information provided to Fractal may have been subject to the data breach. The Fractal team can provide users with the most context about their specific cases and impact.</p>\n<p>The privacy of our community’s data is critically important to us. We reached out to Fractal to request deletion of any user data from Optimism community members. Because the data belongs to individuals and not Optimism, they informed us that users need to request data deletion personally. You can email privacy@fractal.id to request data deletion. Please feel free to use the following template:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>​\"Dear Fractal team,</p>\n<p>I hereby request the deletion of my account with Fractal ID and erasure of the underlying personal data.\"</p>\n<p>Please confirm via email when this deletion has been completed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fractal has assured us that they have reached out to all impacted users. If you have not received an email from noreply@fractal.id, then your data is not believed to have been among the records compromised.</p>\n<p>We’re following developments closely and our team is communicating with Fractal to advocate for Optimism users and their data protection. We’ll continue to share material updates here as they become available, but encourage users to reach out directly to Fractal for information.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/fractal-breach-information/8626\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/fractal-breach-information/8626","pubDate":"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 18:11:33 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8626"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/fractal-breach-information/8626.rss","#text":"Fractal Breach Information"},"filter":false}]}}}
