Justice DAO is operated for charitable purposes by sympathizers of Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Donations are processed in compliance with US laws. Donated funds are paid to the outside counsel representing Storm and Pertsev and are applied to outstanding invoices for legal fees and costs.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>B. Donations are legitimate, legal, and ethical</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>This campaign will make history and donors should decide which side they want to be on.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>A number of well-known industry participants have already decided to stand with Roman &amp; Alexey and against government overreach.</li>\n<li>This is not just about defending developers ‚Äì although that is important ‚Äì it is also about demonstrating that the crypto community is full of good people who comply with the law. It is about defeating the government‚Äôs narrative that crypto is only used by criminals and others who have wrongful motives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Donating to a defense fund is legal in the United States. So is discussing and supporting donation efforts publicly on platforms (as in the case with governance forums and voting portals, for example).</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no legal or ethical prohibition against defense funds. And in the US, donors arguably have First Amendment rights to contribute to causes like this one, free from government interference or retaliation.</li>\n<li>Both Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm are represented by reputable counsel based in the Netherlands and the state of California, respectively. There is an obvious, legitimate need for defense funding because they are in the middle of defending themselves against two different governments that have vast resources to use against them.</li>\n<li>Several advocacy groups including <a href=\"https://x.com/valkenburgh/status/1776327351657181293\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coin Center</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1776345227717951600\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockchain Association</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/amandatums/status/1776293907929714757\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi Education Fund</a>, have already recognized the need here and have filed public amicus briefs in support of the defense efforts. Confidentiality issues limit how much can be said between now and then, but there is substantial and increasing community support for Mr. Storm and Mr. Pertsev, including organizations that are willing to make public statements in court in support of this cause.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The fundraising campaign is compliant with the law.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Donors have the option of contributing to the cause directly through JusticeDAO‚Äôs website <a href=\"https://wewantjusticedao.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://wewantjusticedao.org</a> or by contributing ETH via <a href=\"http://juicebox.money/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">juicebox.money</a>.</li>\n<li>All incoming donations are screened for risk indicators, including money laundering and sanctions risk.

The project focuses on creating impact in the art world, both on-chain and off-chain, through initiatives like educational workshops, artist collaborations, art residencies, equipment acquisitions, exhibitions, and community building. The user, Bulls from NewtroArts, shared their experience with RPGF3 and discussed concerns regarding the recent changes in the ‚ÄúBuilder‚Äôs round‚Äù of RPGF4. They expressed sadness that their project can no longer apply to RPGF due to the shift in focus towards Token House Missions.

Feedback from Round 3 highlighted the need for reliable data on impact and standardized metrics, stronger eligibility criteria, and shorter application windows. To enhance the process, project artifacts are now collected to inform future rounds. To streamline and enhance identity management, a new Farcaster sign-in process replaces connecting wallets, allowing for account recovery and persistent identity. Projects need to be created separately from applications, fostering persistent project identities and enabling team member changes. Additional improvements include collecting funding information, email changes, and stronger eligibility criteria. These changes are seen as foundational elements for the evolving identity layer of the system.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"retro-funding-application-review-processhttpsgovoptimismiotretro-funding-application-review-process8012-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#retro-funding-application-review-processhttpsgovoptimismiotretro-funding-application-review-process8012-4\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-application-review-process/8012\">Retro Funding: Application Review Process</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-04-24<br>\n<strong>Summary</strong><br>\nThis post outlines a framework for the application review process for future Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) rounds, specifically focusing on Retro Funding 4. The application review process aims to determine the eligibility of applicants, enforce application rules, and minimize human review efforts. Learnings from past rounds, such as Retro Funding 3, guide the improvement efforts for Retro Funding 4. The proposed process includes automated filtering, badgeholder review, appeals, and attestation phases. Key goals include minimizing human review, reducing duplicate work, and maximizing consistency in rule enforcement. Eligibility criteria and application rules are established, and applicants go through a structured review process to ensure compliance. The post also highlights the eligibility criteria and draft application rules for Retro Funding 4, emphasizing clarity, quality, and fairness in the selection process.

To support teams in committing full-time to the Collective, they are experimenting with ‚Äúbackstop grants‚Äù as a temporary measure. These grants provide teams with a minimum value of funding over a defined timeframe and scope of work, with the expectation that the recipients will shift towards Retro Funding in the long term. The success of this program will be determined by increased team commitments and teams receiving Retro Funding equal to or exceeding their backstop grant amounts.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"grants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-rounduphttpsgovoptimismiotgrants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-roundup8030-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#grants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-rounduphttpsgovoptimismiotgrants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-roundup8030-7\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-roundup/8030\">Grants Council - Cycle 22 Preliminary Review Roundup</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-04-26<br>\n<strong>Summary</strong><br>\nThe Cycle 22 Preliminary Review has concluded with 234 applications received in total.

Its primary objective is to process Delegate Mission Applications in accordance with established procedures, review applications periodically, publish reports on grant finalists, monitor grant recipients‚Äô progress, maintain transparency, and ease the workload on delegates. The council is structured into three Sub-Committees - Builders, Growth Experiments, and Milestones &amp; Metrics, each tasked with specific responsibilities aimed at advancing the Governance Fund charter. In Season 5, the council operates with three key roles - Communications Lead, Operations Lead, and Milestone and Metrics Lead, held by Katie Garcia, Gonna.eth, and Jun (Pgov) respectively. The Grants Council in Season 5 operates for two rounds, following a detailed calendar. It holds the authority to determine grant recipients, but does not issue or distribute grants, with the Foundation managing grant implementation. For further details, refer to the Season 5 Grants Council Charter and related announcements.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"missing-grant-application-feedback-season-5httpsgovoptimismiotmissing-grant-application-feedback-season-58029-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#missing-grant-application-feedback-season-5httpsgovoptimismiotmissing-grant-application-feedback-season-58029-9\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/missing-grant-application-feedback-season-5/8029\">Missing Grant Application Feedback - Season 5</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-04-26<br>\n<strong>Summary</strong><br>\nThe topic is about the frustration and disappointment of a developer whose applications for season 5, specifically on ‚ÄúCharmVerse - the all-in-one web3 space‚Äù, were rejected without receiving any feedback or comments. The developer expresses understanding that rejections happen but emphasizes the importance of constructive feedback. The lack of feedback is seen as disrespectful and lacking transparency, raising concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the application review process for all applicants.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"govscore-updates-hedgey-rpgf-re-grant-winnerhttpsgovoptimismiotgovscore-updates-hedgey-rpgf-re-grant-winner8038-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#govscore-updates-hedgey-rpgf-re-grant-winnerhttpsgovoptimismiotgovscore-updates-hedgey-rpgf-re-grant-winner8038-10\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/govscore-updates-hedgey-rpgf-re-grant-winner/8038\">GovScore Updates (Hedgey RPGF Re-Grant Winner)</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-04-27<br>\n<strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>GovScore, one of the winners of the Hedgey RPGF Grant program for projects focusing on Optimism, will provide bi-weekly updates for 3 months to showcase their progress to the Optimism community.

This verification process can help with protecting the ecosystems treasury assets by checking that the funding is being used as intended.</p>\n<p>Contribution efforts could be grouped together by using a milestone approach or by using time intervals such as monthly. Alternatively contribution efforts could also be recorded by each individual in monthly time intervals.</p>\n<p>After looking at the problems and opportunities for making group based contribution logs as well as individual contribution logs, we identified that individual contribution logs were the most promising approach worth considering. As well as verifying contribution efforts the individual contribution log approach also had a number of other use cases that could be highly valuable for contributors and Web3 ecosystems.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Advantages of individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved contribution verification</strong> - It is more difficult to hide poor contribution performance if efforts are recorded individually and at the end of every month. Individual contribution logs make it easier to verify which contributors have been making sufficient contribution efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved decision making</strong> - If contribution logs are recorded monthly and are focused on individuals contribution efforts the measurability of these logs can be much higher than the group based approaches. This makes it easier for voters to identify the best and worst performers and also can make it easier for them to compare contributors across the ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Retaining top performers</strong> - Some ideas and teams won‚Äôt produce the intended outcomes. Individual contribution logs can help with identifying the top performers in different teams that might have not generated much impact. Individual contribution logs could help with making it easier to for voters to see what actually happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher self awareness &amp; accountability</strong> - Contributors would be able to more easily review the contribution efforts of other people in the ecosystem and use that information to become more aware of how performant each contributor is. This information can help contributors with becoming more accountable for achieving a similar or higher level of performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowers individual contributors</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help to empower contributors by making it easier for them to demonstrate their competencies and performance. Their contribution logs can help them with building a reputation in the ecosystem and wider industry that can make it easier for them to receive future funding and fair compensation for their skill level.</li>\n<li><strong>Removed intermediaries</strong> - Individual contribution logs can help with reducing the influence of certain individuals and project owners from determining someone‚Äôs compensation in group based working environments. Contribution logs can help with making it easier for someone to demonstrate themselves what their value is within group working environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible information usage</strong> - More detail about the ideas that are being executed can be highlighted in someones contribution log. These logs could include which milestone would be relevant to the contribution efforts. This added context means that a collection of different peoples individual contribution logs could help with creating project based information such as the total contribution efforts towards an idea in the last month or the amount of contribution efforts that have been made towards a certain project milestone. More granularity and detail about each persons contributions efforts means that it can become easier to group and layer this information into different formats that could be more useful and insightful to the viewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for individual contribution logs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open source contribution data</strong> - The more that individual contribution logs are used over time the more valuable the information becomes. Monthly recordings of individual contribution efforts are much more measurable than the alternative approaches. Individual contribution logs can be used for making historical comparisons as the ecosystem evolves and grows over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Self sovereign identity adoption</strong> - Individual contribution logs can be tied to a persons identity. Contribution logs could be a powerful use case for increasing the adoption of self sovereign identity solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust based networks</strong> - Verifiable contribution data could be used to create some form of trust based network that people use to prove their competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they‚Äôve built and the common connections they share.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Read our full analysis, or watch our video summaries, that cover contribution verification and contribution logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/contributions/contribution-verification\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://disbursement.treasuries.co/approaches/contribution-verification-approaches\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution verification approaches</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Experimentation in Optimism</strong></p>\n<p>Individual contribution logs could be integrated into the existing grants process or be used by individuals in the ecosystem as an evidence based way to start building up their own reputation. Idea funding and contributor funding could both experiment with individual contribution logs.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Further investigation</strong></p>\n<p>These is an opportunity to create more tooling that could enable individual contributors to easily record and present their contribution efforts. Contribution logs could become increasingly useful and reliable for contributors to build their reputation in the ecosystem and for voters when making funding decisions.</p>\n<p>In the comings months the Web3 Association is going to look at what tooling already exists that could be used and then explore what new tools could be created to make it easier to record and present contribution efforts. We‚Äôre especially interested in improving the exposure and presentation of code contributions, this is an area of high relevance to our open source contributor proposal (docs. contributors .org/proposal/open-source-contributors) that has been recently shared.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Community discussion</strong></p>\n<p>Share any feedback and thoughts you have around the topic of contribution verification and the different approaches we‚Äôve explored in our analysis.

Inspired by a community member‚Äôs <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/seeking-mission-request-sponsorship/7130/22\">post</a>, we will test the below hypothesis, among others, during Retro Funding 4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A deliberative process can allow voters to come to consensus on a subject that would otherwise be difficult to come to consensus on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More specifically, we want to understand whether voter participation in a deliberative process increases agreement on a contested topic, and whether the resulting decision leads to broader satisfaction and clarity in the Retro Funding process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will run this initial experiment as a pilot that could later be scaled to a larger sample size, applied to other parts of the Optimism governance system, and/or expanded to include an in-person assembly, if the preliminary findings are promising.  Specifically, we think a deliberative process could be useful in the setting of collective definitions and/or shared values, preventing gridlock between Houses, coming to collective consensus on complex topics, and/or the future creation of critical governance documents, similar to the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Law%20of%20Chains.md\">Law of Chains.</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"what-are-deliberative-processes-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#what-are-deliberative-processes-2\"></a><strong>What are Deliberative Processes?</strong></h2>\n<p>In its modern meaning, deliberation refers to a collective decision making process which aims to reduce the impact of power structures in discussion. In practice, it generally involves a set of three principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Informed, structured, and facilitated discussion of pros and cons about a topic.</li>\n<li>A process that progresses from individual opinions towards collective judgement.</li>\n<li>A recruitment of a representative group to have the discussion. This is mostly achieved through ‚Äúsortition‚Äù (random selection of participants).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Deliberative democracy has roots all the way back to Aristotle but deliberative processes have been flourishing over the past 20 years in local and global discussions (see <a href=\"https://participedia.net/\">here</a> for many use cases). This method is currently utilized by the likes of the European Commission (to shape the directive on Food Waste, or the strategy on Virtual Worlds: <a href=\"https://citizens.ec.europa.eu/european-citizens-panels_en\" class=\"inline-onebox\">European Citizens‚Äô Panels - European Commission</a>), national governments (more than 20+ such discussions have been held on Climate policy), or local governments (1000+ participatory budgeting discussions allowing citizens to allocate public funds to projects from the community).</p>\n<p>Tech platforms such as <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/leading-the-way-in-governance-innovation-with-community-forums-on-ai/\">Meta</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai-grant-program-update\">OpenAI</a> have explored deliberative processes among their users to discuss topics related to governing AI. In web3, Cosmos has <a href=\"https://forum.cosmos.network/t/discussion-onboarding-managing-offboarding-the-aez-a-set-of-draft-propositions/12054\">experimented</a> with deliberative processes to determine the process and principles for adding or removing chains to the Atom Economic Zone (AEZ).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"what-are-deliberative-processes-useful-for-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#what-are-deliberative-processes-useful-for-3\"></a>What are Deliberative Processes Useful For?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More Informed Decision-Making</strong>: A deliberative process can aid a diverse group of voters with different perspectives and expertise in navigating complex topics without relying on popular opinions, resorting to groupthink, being pressured into conformity, or being driven towards partisanship.</li>\n<li><strong>Greater Chance for Social Cohesion:</strong> Deliberative processes can incorporate varied viewpoints in the process of coming to a shared consensus and promote greater social cohesion between people from different backgrounds. We‚Äôve seen the opposite play out when the community has attempted to come to consensus in the absence of a structured deliberative process.</li>\n<li><strong>Credibly Neutral Consensus:</strong> Structured deliberation gives participants an equal opportunity to discuss and debate the merits and drawbacks of multiple options among a representative sample rather than letting the loudest voices prevail in an unstructured social media debate. This process, facilitated by an expert external third party, can also reduce the influence of special interests (and the Foundation) in the formation of policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy-In:</strong> Deliberative processes can increase the legitimacy of decision making via participation in the policymaking process. Voters may be more likely to commit to and/or abide by policies that have been proposed and agreed-upon amongst themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"retro-funding-4-deliberation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#retro-funding-4-deliberation-4\"></a>Retro Funding 4 Deliberation</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>A subset of 50 Round 4 voters will be randomly selected to participate in the deliberative experiment. Randomly sampling individuals to make governance decisions (also called sortition) is common practice in deliberative democracy as higher quality discussion can be had with a smaller, but still representative, sample of the population. We will also experiment with sortition in Round 6.</li>\n<li>This subset of voters will deliberate on a topic of relevance to Retro Funding Round 4, facilitated by a team specialized in designing and running such processes (from <a href=\"https://missionspubliques.org/?lang=en\">Missions Publiques</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rndao.io/\">RnDAO</a>). This subset will be provided with balanced information on the topic to be debated in advance of the deliberations. Participants will work in a combination of plenary and subgroup settings across 2 sessions:\n<ol>\n<li>Thursday, May 30 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern // 9:30-11:00 Pacific)</li>\n<li>Thursday, June 6 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern // 9:30-11:00 Pacific)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Between the two sessions, the community will be able to comment on the draft output of the deliberation. Also, the plenary moments of the sessions will be opened to the full set of voters in Round 4. This allows for the broader community to better understand and trust the decision-making process.

Early rounds are experimenting towards a future where Retro Funding is mature enough to support the development and maintenance of the Superchain and the entire Collective. This is the fork of capitalism Optimists are building towards: a world where public goods like open source software can thrive, where positive-sum behavior is incentivized, and where impact = profit.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Retro Funding is not yet consistent enough to provide the certainty or predictability teams often need to commit themselves full time to helping build Optimism. As a bootstrapping tactic in these early rounds of iteration, the Optimism Foundation is experimenting with ‚Äú<strong>backstop grants</strong>.‚Äù A backstop grant is a way to give teams the confidence to devote full-time energy to the Collective while still orienting them towards Retro Funding as their long-term source of support. This helps the Foundation reduce its reliance on grants from the Partner Fund and via RFPs, and transition more teams to participating in Retro Funding over time.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"how-it-works-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-it-works-1\"></a><strong>How it works</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In instances in which the Foundation would otherwise make a standard Partner Fund grant, a backstop grant can be made for a certain token amount over a specified time period and specified scope of work. The grant reflects a minimum value of the scoped work, and is subject to completion-based milestones.</li>\n<li>The grantee will be encouraged to participate in any Retro Funding rounds that match the scope of their contribution.</li>\n<li>If the grantee receives less OP from Retro Funding than the value specified in their backstop grant, the grantee will receive additional tokens from the Optimism Foundation to cover the difference.</li>\n<li>If the grantee receives more OP from Retro Funding than specified in their backstop grant, the grantee will not receive any additional tokens from the Optimism Foundation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For example</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Backstop grant for 10,000 OP over 12 months. Project receives 8,000 OP in Retro Funding; they would then receive 2,000 OP from the Foundation for their backstop grant.</li>\n<li>Backstop grant for 10,000 OP over 12 months. Project receives 4,000 OP in Retro Funding; they would then receive 6,000 OP from the Foundation for their backstop grant.</li>\n<li>Backstop grant for 10,000 OP over 12 months. Project receives 12,000 OP in Retro Funding; they would then receive 0 OP from the Foundation for their backstop grant.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"selection-criteria-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#selection-criteria-2\"></a>Selection &amp; Criteria</h2>\n<p>The list of teams who have received a backstop grant to date (as of 14 April 2024) includes Agora and Open Source Observer. We will keep this post updated as other backstop grants are made.</p>\n<p>Backstop grants may be made in similar circumstances to those in which a standard Partner Fund grant would be made. To better align incentives, they are more likely to be utilized for teams of builders that are dedicating all or a majority of their bandwidth to the Optimism Collective, and are working on critical infrastructure ‚Äì including the OP Stack, retro funding tooling, or chain infra provisioning. The size of each grant is estimated to approximate the impact provided to the Collective.</p>\n<p>These grants are designed to lower the risk of a team committing substantial bandwidth to the Collective, while also preserving the importance of Retro Funding and public accountability for impact.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"backstop-grants-retro-funding-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#backstop-grants-retro-funding-3\"></a><strong>Backstop Grants &amp; Retro Funding</strong></h2>\n<p>In past Retro Funding rounds, the project signup experience has asked for information about past or existing grants and funding sources. We expect voters in Retro Funding to make their assessment of a project‚Äôs impact <strong>without</strong> considering the existence of a backstop grant. Therefore, the exact amounts of each backstop grant are not disclosed, allowing badge holders to impartially assess a project‚Äôs impact.</p>\n<p>As we evolve Retro Funding into the primary source of impact support across the Collective, we want core teams to orient towards Retro Funding as much as possible. The backstop grant serves as just one type de-risk mechanism for projects that spend a majority of their team‚Äôs bandwidth on Optimism. This is a temporary bootstrapping experiment as Optimism continues to work towards reliable, regular Retro Funding rounds that can support ongoing core development across the Collective. In addition, Retro Funding may also benefit from additional mechanisms developed by the community to experiment towards the same goal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"success-criteria-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#success-criteria-4\"></a>Success Criteria</h2>\n<p>This program is an experiment in creating alignment and increasing product velocity across the Collective. This program will be considered a success if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More teams are willing to make a full time commitment to building Optimism.</li>\n<li>Teams with backstop grants receive Retro Funding equal to or greater than the size of their backstop grant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thanks to Matt Stephenson and LauNaMu for feedback on earlier drafts of this post, as part of the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863\">Collective Feedback Commission</a></em></p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-backstop-grants/8031\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-backstop-grants/8031","pubDate":"Fri, 26 Apr 2024 21:06:00 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8031"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-backstop-grants/8031.rss","#text":"Introducing Backstop Grants"},"filter":false},{"title":"Grants Council - Cycle 22 Preliminary Review Roundup","dc:creator":"Gonna.eth","category":"Grants","description":"<p>The Cycle 22 Preliminary Review has concluded.</p>\n<p>We received a total of 234 applications during this round.

Collected artifacts are not only relevant to Retro round 4, but will be essential to inform future rounds such as Retro Funding 7: Dev Tooling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Github Repo verification: Ownership over a Github repo is verified by asking the user to add a JSON file with a unique identifier to their repo. This verification method has been established by <a href=\"http://drips.network\">Drips.network</a> and we‚Äôre excited to build on this standard.</li>\n<li>Contract verification: Ownership over a contract, or set of contracts, is verified by asking the user to provide a message which has been signed by the deployer address of the contract(s). We‚Äôre building an additional solution for contract verification in collaboration with Opensource Observer, as some projects might have lost access to their deployer address</li>\n<li>NPM packages: A project can provide a reference to one or multiple NPM packages</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"sign-in-with-farcaster-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#sign-in-with-farcaster-4\"></a>Sign in with Farcaster</h2>\n<p>The first thing applicants will notice when using the new Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) sign up flow is that they are asked to sign in with Farcaster instead of connecting a wallet. We‚Äôre making this change for a few reasons.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"learnings-from-previous-retro-funding-applications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#learnings-from-previous-retro-funding-applications-5\"></a>Learnings from previous Retro Funding applications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Account recovery: In past rounds, we noticed that applicants submitted their application with an Ethereum address and later wanted to change the address with which to manage the application. Without a separate user account identifier it is impossible to swap out the Ethereum address associated with an applicant. Additionally, the Foundation does not want to manually manage account recovery, because this would effectively give it centralized control over user accounts.</li>\n<li>Persistent identity: We want individuals to be able to build a persistent identity within the Optimism Collective, as part of Retro Funding and beyond. For example, we want attestations like ‚Äúthis person was on a team that was granted Retro Funding Round 3‚Äù to persist to an individual even if they want to rotate their keys or have lost access to their Ethereum account (see above). Project identities are distinct from individual identities and will be covered below.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"why-farcaster-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#why-farcaster-6\"></a>Why Farcaster?</h3>\n<p>The Optimism Collective could solve the above two problems by creating unique account identifiers and enabling Retro Funding applicants to create an Optimism account that is recoverable and persists even with key rotation. However, the Farcaster protocol already supports this functionality, and as an Optimism-native project, it has gained adoption from a large number of Optimism builders. We‚Äôre excited to build on shared standards and open source protocols rather than duplicating functionality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Existing identity: Retro Funding applicants that already have a Farcaster account will be able to get started in a couple of clicks instead of having to rebuild their profile (avatar, name, bio, social links). The account <a href=\"https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/guides/writing/verify-address\">verifications functionality</a> of the Farcaster protocol enables users to import important elements of their identity (NFTs, ENS) from their other Etherum accounts, and can also be used to import attestations if and when relevant. For example, the voting badge lives in Citizens‚Äô Ethereum accounts, and can be connected to a Farcaster profile via the verifications feature in the Warpcast app. New attestations issued as part of Retro Funding signup will refer to individuals‚Äô <a href=\"https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/contracts/reference/id-registry\">Farcaster ids</a> as part of the attestation schema, rather than utilizing the ‚Äòrecipient‚Äô field, which will remain null.</li>\n<li>Integrated social graph: In the past Retro Funding round, more than 50% of initial applications were spam and had to be manually reviewed by Citizens ahead of voting. As a programme that will be the continued target of Sybil attacks and spam, Retro Funding can benefit from plugging into the Farcaster social graph. There are several teams already working on Sybil-detection within the Farcaster network - these efforts can be leveraged for future Retro Funding application experiences.</li>\n<li>What if I don‚Äôt have a Farcaster account?: To keep scope minimal for this first build, applicants will have to go to Farcaster to create an account before they can create a project and apply for Retro Funding 4. In the future, we hope to enable applicants to connect an Ethereum account in the sign-up process and we‚Äôll <a href=\"https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts\">register a new Farcaster id</a> to the Ethereum account so users don‚Äôt have to leave the app.</li>\n<li>Establishing Identity: We strongly encourage everyone to consider the benefits of maintaining a single identity for activities across the superchain. In the future, attestations and other reputational signals may be used to flag potential Sybils, identify possible citizens, and select candidates for bounties among others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"creating-projects-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#creating-projects-7\"></a>Creating Projects</h2>\n<p>The second thing applicants will notice in the Retro Funding 4 application flow is that they will be asked to create a project before submitting an application. This minor change requires an update in the mental model. Projects ‚â† applications. A project is run by an individual or multiple individuals and is something that creates impact within the Optimism Collective.</p>\n<p>A project can be as small as a hackathon project or as big as an app built by a large organization. The important thing is that projects are things that have quantifiable impact on Optimism and are assessed during Retro Funding rounds for impact within specific time periods defined in the round. Applications, on the other hand, are a submission of a project for funding in a specific round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"learnings-from-previous-retro-funding-applications-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#learnings-from-previous-retro-funding-applications-8\"></a>Learnings from previous Retro Funding applications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Project identity: Previously, projects did not build a persistent identity across Optimism touch points such as Token House grant applications and Retro Funding, or even between Retro Funding rounds. The same project would have to re-enter the same basic information when submitting the Retro Funding application for each round. In past rounds, attestations that were really about projects were made about the individual Ethereum accounts that submitted the application, rather than about the project itself. This made it really difficult to track the development of projects over time and the people contributing to them. Similar to how we want to enable individuals to develop a persistent identity within Optimism, we also want projects to have a persistent identity. Instead of entering the same data over again for every Retro Funding round, projects will be evergreen and continue to persist between and across rounds. This also enables projects to build up a reputation by consistently creating impact and receiving funding, and for individuals to build up their own reputation by being part of the team of a successful project.</li>\n<li>Changes to the project‚Äôs team: In past Retro Funding rounds, there were several cases where an individual team member submitted an application for Retro Funding and then left the team before voting was completed and could no longer manage the application. By separating the applicant from the project, we make it possible for projects to be run by multiple people, and for those people to change over time. Each project will have one or more contributors, whose roles can change over time as people join and leave the project. The initial release will include a simple off-chain mapping of team members to projects, with the goal of moving this on-chain in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes are being released as part of Round 4 with the expectation that they will form the foundation of the identity layer of the stack that will grow and evolve over time. However, everything we build is iterative so it is possible that changes will be rolled-back or adapted based on learnings with each subsequent iteration.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"other-improvements-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#other-improvements-9\"></a>Other improvements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Funding &amp; Grant information: based on feedback in Retro round 3, the application process collects relevant information on different funding &amp; grants a project has received, including VC funding.</li>\n<li>Email changes &amp; project admin: In Retro Funding 3, we have found that many projects needed to change their email address after applying, or lost access to the address which they used to apply. In case a user loses access to their address they can leverage Farcaster‚Äôs account recovery feature. A user is always able to update their email address within their profile. Please note: The Optimism Foundation will not be able to recover profiles for which access to the relevant Farcaster account has been fully lost. The designs of the sign-up process aim to communicate this very clearly</li>\n<li>Shortened Application window: The application window has been shortened to 14 days from 31 days in Retro Funding 3, see<a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988\"> here</a> for more details.</li>\n<li>Stronger Eligibility Criteria: Stronger eligibility criteria have been defined based on feedback from Retro Funding 3, see<a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988\"> here</a> for more details.</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013","pubDate":"Wed, 24 Apr 2024 12:47:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8013"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013.rss","#text":"Retro Funding 4: Application process"},"filter":false},{"title":"Retro Funding: Application Review Process","dc:creator":"system","category":"üî¥ Retro Funding","description":"<p><em>Special thanks to Sov from Gitcoin and DisruptionJoe from Plurality Labs for review &amp; input and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/joanbp\">@joanbp</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/griff\">@Griff</a> for feedback as part of the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863\">Feedback Commission</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This post outlines a framework for the application review process of future Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) rounds and its application to Retro Funding 4. The application review process is applied to decide which applicants are eligible to participate in retro rounds and is used to enforce application rules and eligibility criteria.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"learnings-from-retro-funding-3-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#learnings-from-retro-funding-3-1\"></a><strong>Learnings from Retro Funding 3</strong></h3>\n<p>You can find an overview of the Retro Funding 3 application review process <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-application-review-process/6916\">here</a> and its learnings <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA\">here</a>. Below you find a summary of the main learnings from the application review process in Retro Funding 3:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The optimistic approach (e.g. a project first needs to be reported) lead to an increase in operational effort. Due to:<br>\na. There being no incentive for community members to review all applications and report malicious ones<br>\nb. There being no effective way of tracking which applications have already been reviewed or reported</li>\n<li>Reviewers sometimes applied criteria outside of application rules (e.g. subjective judgements on who should participate) or applied rules inconsistently across cases.</li>\n<li>A large amount of obvious spam submissions required review by multiple humans</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"application-review-process-framework-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#application-review-process-framework-2\"></a><strong>Application Review process framework</strong></h2>\n<p>Based on learnings from past Retro rounds you can find our goals for iterating on the application review process below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Minimize human review</strong>: We received tons of obvious spam in Retro Funding 3, which all needed to be reviewed by at least 5 humans. In this iteration, we aim to rely more on automated filtering of low quality submissions‚Ä¶</li>\n<li><strong>Minimize duplicate work:</strong> In Retro Funding 3, each application was reviewed by multiple volunteers who could report the application for rule violations. This uncoordinated approach lead to duplicate work. We aim to minimize duplicate work by relying on clear roles and responsibilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Maximize consistency of rule enforcement</strong>: In Retro Funding 3, rules were subjectively applied by randomly selected badgeholders, which lead to a difference in rule application across cases. We aim to provide more consistency in how rules are applied.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"proposed-process-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#proposed-process-overview-3\"></a>Proposed Process overview</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Retro Funding eligibility criteria and application rules are established</strong><br>\n1.1 <strong>Eligibility criteria</strong>: For each Retro Funding round, there are pre-defined eligibility criteria. This sets expectations to builders and minimizes the amount of non-qualifying applications. Ideally, eligibility criteria are enforced in the sign up process.<br>\n1.2 <strong>Application rules</strong>: For each Retro Funding round, there is a set of application rules (ideally standardised across rounds), which applications must adhere to. Violating these rules will result in exclusion from the Retro Funding round.</li>\n<li><strong>Application submission:</strong> Retro Funding applicants submit their applications by a certain deadline. After this deadline, applications are final and can no longer be edited.</li>\n<li><strong>Application review Phase 1:</strong> Applications are excluded via automated filtering and badgeholder review<br>\n3.1. <strong>Automated filtering:</strong> To reduce manual human review of applications, automation must be used to identify submissions which violate application rules or eligibility criteria. Identified applications might be automatically excluded, or flagged to badgeholders for review.<br>\n3.2 <strong>Badgeholder review:</strong> a set of badgeholders review applications for eligibility criteria and application rule violations.</li>\n<li><strong>Appeals</strong>: All applications which are excluded in review phase 1 get the chance to hand in an appeal. An appeal can refute the reasons for excluding the application, while application content can not be edited/changed.</li>\n<li><strong>Application review phase 2 (appeal review):</strong> Appeals are reviewed by a number of badgeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Application approval/rejection attestation</strong>: Following application review, attestations which indicate approval or rejection are issued for each Retro Funding application.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that application content is final following the application deadline. Allowing for edits following the deadline within the application review process could lead to a significant increase in operational effort and complexity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"badgeholder-review-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#badgeholder-review-4\"></a>Badgeholder Review</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Badgeholders are asked to opt-in to participate in the application review process</li>\n<li>From the opt-in list, a number of badgeholders are randomly selected to participate, based on the expected number of applications to be reviewed</li>\n<li><strong>Application review Phase 1:</strong> All applications are reviewed by badgeholders to enforce eligibility criteria and application rules<br>\n3.1. <strong>Rule violations are flagged</strong>: Each badgeholder is presented with subset of applications and is tasked with reviewing them for meeting specific eligibility criteria and/or application rules. Each application is reviewed by at least two badgeholders.<br>\n3.2. <strong>Flagged rule violations are reviewed</strong>: If a badgeholder flags an application rule violation or failure to meet eligibility criteria, 4 other badgeholders will be asked to review the case and confirm. 3/5 badgeholders need to agree for an application to be excluded</li>\n<li><strong>Application Review Phase 2 (appeals)</strong><br>\n4.1. Each rejected application is notified of their opportunity to hand in an appeal<br>\n4.2. Each badgeholder is presented with a subset of the appeals cases and is tasked with reviewing each.<br>\n4.3.

This was the direct result of our ‚ÄúArts &amp; W3b‚Äù free workshop for artists‚Äô onboarding to the blockchain.

With some shyness, i can proudly say that sometimes we heard the words ‚ÄúThe Newtro model‚Äù, something that humbled but also excited us a lot.</p>\n<p>Talks of being able to talk with other more recent artists‚Äô Collectives to give a hand or advice,<br>\nor even share our knowledge with Mexican projects (!), ignited our flame and made us realize that soon, this is something we had to do. We take Culture and the promotion of arts and artists as serious as it is. And we are happy to share what we know. <strong>With the Artists Collectives, but also with whomever would find productive to hear us from the OP Collective.</strong></p>\n<p>But in order for this kind of projects (artists collectives trying to create onchain and offchain impact)<br>\nto thrive, as anyone else, we need financial support. We and our partners and sponsors know how hard we work, how much impact we conduct to the blockchain, off the chain, and how many artists lives we touch.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs why i wanted to raise a bit my voice, and hopefully bring to light some concerns that im sure<br>\nwe are not the only ones experiencing, since the changes made at the Builder‚Äôs category of RPGF4.<br>\nWe are more than willing to <strong>keep sharing abt our experience, its importance, and its needs</strong>.I must say that we are thankful for the ‚ÄúToken House Missions‚Äù but its hard to create something lasting, cohesive and truly impactful just by hosting events from time to time. Working for culture and art is an everyday job for us, which we as artists ourselves, do passionately and with the highest compromise.</p>\n<p>So once again, thanks for reading, thanks for all the work the OP Collective is doing at so many levels<br>\nand finally. <strong>We open this space to talk about how we can make a better job in culture and arts and the blockchain and the role of RPGF and OP</strong>. Hope we can read from you in order to improve things all around &lt;3</p>\n<p>If you want to reach Newtro, or know more about it, you can check our linktree:</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://linktr.ee/newtroarts\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/2/279eb9049c2df90165c120d4e2503d5a9da4971e.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"43E660\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/newtroarts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Linktree</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/3/3ef821952ab58df2c2665852bcfc956ffaadd2e5_2_500x500.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"583F0E\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://linktr.ee/newtroarts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Newtro Arts | Twitter, Instagram | Linktree</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Linktree.

In DAO governance‚Äôs reality though, only a handful of primitives achieved significant adoption. 1token1vote links voting power directly to the number of tokens held. Vote delegation allows token holders to assign their voting rights to another party, enabling concentrated decision-making power based on trust.</p>\n<p>There is a third class of voting mechanisms to complement these concepts: make a voter‚Äôs track record count in DAO decisions, and use proofs of expertise and achievements as a signal to define voting weight and decision-making power. In this experiment, TE Academy explores the potential of Reputation-based Weighted Voting in an educational project. Students will have the chance to go over the entire token engineering process and work on a case study with a real voting outcome - deciding on the winner of the first TE Academy fellowship with a $10K prize for the fellowship winner.</p>\n<p>Over the past 3 years, TE Academy has established a system of NFT proofs to track individual community members‚Äô achievements and the development of the sector overall. We‚Äôve issued more than 1000 NFTs to students who‚Äôve passed knowledge requirements and to researchers with significant contributions to the token engineering discipline. In our experiment, any community member will be eligible to vote - however, holding Token Engineering NFTs will increase a voter‚Äôs weight in this decision. No popularity contest!</p>\n<p>We‚Äôll account for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>passed exams in the TE Fundamentals course (more than <a href=\"https://tokenengineering.net/explore/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">4000 students enrolled</a>)</li>\n<li>sharing knowledge as a speaker at TE Academy events (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TE-Academy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">more than 120</a> over the last 3 years)</li>\n<li>contributions to our shared body of knowledge in the form of online learning materials (first <a href=\"https://tokenengineering.net/explore/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bachelor-level course in token engineering</a>)</li>\n<li>supporting students as study group host (in one of 45 study groups)</li>\n<li>and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Reputation-based Weighted Voting can be applied to any DAO decision-making cases where expertise is required to make good decisions. In RWV systems, voters are encouraged to sharpen their profile and become highly sought-after experts in their domain of decisions (e.g. Retro-Public Goods Funding, Risk Management). For a DAO‚Äôs collective, it‚Äôs an opportunity to establish incentives for decision-makers and grant voting power to those who were actively involved in good decisions.<br>\nCombined with 1token1vote and vote delegation, it‚Äôs a new building block to make decisions transparent, and robust against collusion, bribery, and economic attacks.</p>\n<p>We offer this program as part of our public goods education, enabled by Optimism RetroPGF! <strong>The results of this experiment, as well as the voting algorithm and a simulation engine, will be available open-source.</strong></p>\n<p>Learn more about our program in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gQKKt755n6Y?si=XsTY2Iw_CaK2j4yU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this presentation at the Optimism Demo Day</a>!</p>\n<p>Today, more than 4000 students are enrolled in TE Academy‚Äôs studying programs, and research initiatives.

By setting stronger eligibility criteria in Retro Funding 4, the Foundation aims to provide clarity to builders and reduce the amount of human review required for spam and low-quality application. In addition, qualifying criteria reduce the number of applicants who have not generated sufficient impact to receive rewards (such as the below requirement of a minimum number of unique address interactions). The below eligibility criteria aim to strike a balance between broad inclusivity and sufficient requirements to allow for an operationally viable Retro Funding round.</p>\n<p><strong>Builders are eligible who have</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deployed their onchain contracts on one or multiple of the following OP chains: OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Frax and Metal, and meet the following criteria:\n<ul>\n<li>Onchain contracts have interactions from 420 unique addresses during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contracts had their first transaction before April 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contract had more than 10 days of activity during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Verified their onchain contracts in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Made their contract code available in a public Github repo, for which ownership has been verified in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Confirmed that they will comply with Optimism Foundation KYC requirements and are not residing in a sanctioned country</li>\n<li>Submitted a Retro Funding application before June 6th, 2024 and comply with application rules</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"round-sizing-10m-op-to-reward-onchain-builders-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#round-sizing-10m-op-to-reward-onchain-builders-5\"></a>Round Sizing: 10m OP to reward Onchain Builders</h2>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 will allocated 10m OP to reward the impact of Onchain Builders. The OP token allocation for Retro Funding 4 should reflect the impact generated by onchain builders, as well as set a strong incentive for the continuous generation of demand for Optimism blockspace.<br>\nBelow you find some considerations which informed the Foundation‚Äôs round sizing decision:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Underallocation to Onchain Builders in Retro Funding 3:</strong> Previously, Retro Funding 3 allocated a total of <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">1.5M out of 30M OP</a> to the top 20% of applicants who generated network usage. There has been <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">strong feedback from badgeholders and community</a> members that this allocation was too low and should be increased in future rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Growth in developer activity since last round:</strong> The Collective is focused on growing the number of active onchain developers. Developer activity, across the Superchain, <a href=\"https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-chains-revenue-generating-deployer-addresses\">has seen a large increase over the past six months</a>. Thus, Retro Funding rewards to these types of contributions should increase to reflect this increase in impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Collective sustainability:</strong> In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders have <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">raised concerns around Retro Funding sustainability</a>. Retro Funding currently relies on the Retroactive Public Goods Funding token allocation of 850M OP for rewards. <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY\">In the future</a>, Retro Funding will rely on surplus protocol revenue as the source of rewards. Currently, <a href=\"https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-collective-contribution\">Total Collective Contributions</a> (of surplus protocol revenue) fall short of what is needed to sustain Retroactive Public Goods Funding. Additionally, in Retro Funding 3, badgeholders raised points <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">around the relationship of rewards to the sequencer revenue</a>, to ensure rewards don‚Äôt exceed the sequencer revenue itself. By allocating a significant amount of OP to rewarding onchain builders, the Citizens‚Äô House is incentivizing developer growth and increased network activity.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"future-round-sizing-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#future-round-sizing-6\"></a>Future round sizing</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 &amp; 5, and will proposes round sizes for Retro Funding 6 &amp; 7, to be ratified by the Citizens‚Äô House. In the future, this process will gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons. Round sizing decisions are currently informed by the amount of impact observed within the Collective, considerations for incentivising contributors to take action, and sustainability of Retro Funding rewards. In the future, these decisions should be made based on a framework which takes a number of established measurements and criteria into. We invite Data NERDs to explore measurements and criteria which will inform governance participants to make informed budgeting decisions in the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"voting-design-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#voting-design-7\"></a>Voting design</h2>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 experiments with <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861\">Metrics-based Evaluation</a>, with the hypothesis that by leveraging quantitive metrics, citizens are able to more accurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more accurate judgements of the impact delivered by individual contributors.<br>\nIn stark contrast to other Retro Funding experiments, badgeholders will not vote on individual projects but will rather vote via selecting and weighting a number of metrics which measure different types of impact. You can find out more about prototypes and explorations that informed this design <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimentation-impact-metric-based-voting/7727\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact metrics</strong><br>\nAll Citizens will be asked to vote in Retro Funding 4 and will be invited to actively shape and input on the design of impact metrics via discussions on the forum as well as a workshop.

Selecting the right ecosystem projects to fund, which tokens to list in a lending market, and the outcome of a protocol fee switch are valuable propositions that affect all community stakeholders. Once the combined value at stake reaches a critical mass, the founding team is unable to make decisions by themselves without running the risk of centralization. As a result, many aspects of the decentralized protocol model make governance unavoidable.</p>\n<p>But token voting as a mechanism for decentralized governance has introduced its own <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">set of problems</a>. An inherent conflict of interest arises when voting power is disproportionately concentrated among a small group of wealthy token holders. As an example, venture funds or whales involved in external projects might be incentivized to pursue agendas that benefit their broader portfolio at the expense of the protocol‚Äôs long-term success. In addition, the over-reliance on token voting not only entrenches the power of a wealthy few but also undermines the collective action taken by smaller stakeholders. Smaller delegates within the Optimism ecosystem often <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2830772/4724839/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">refrain from voting</a> due to their individual decisions ‚Äúnot mattering much‚Äù. The situation creates a paradox where the promise of decentralization leads to a quasi-centralization of power and an absence of true preferences.</p>\n<p>Doxamarket aims to address these gaps by offering a novel approach to incentivize voter participation and mitigate the inefficiencies associated with governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"information-markets-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#information-markets-2\"></a>Information Markets</h2>\n<p>Onchain information markets have gained immense popularity recently with the rise of <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Polymarket</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1775542217307791366\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">liquidity-backed Kalshi</a>. Their success confirms the financial value that assigning probabilities to future outcomes and sub outcomes can generate. Most importantly, we believe information markets carry an <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/04/01/dc.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">element of chaos</a> that could be directly applied to form consensus in decentralized governance. The crypto space will always prefer chaotic and decisive action over stasis debates between two protocol researchers. Integrating information markets into the onchain decision-making process introduces a novel way to financially incentivize token-voting, increase voter participation, and force true preferences from broader ecosystem participants.</p>\n<p>For the implementation of this idea, Doxamarket (formerly BetCaster) has <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-4085199193924518\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">received a grant of 50,000 OP</a> from Optimism‚Äôs Mission Request Round 1.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"didomi-as-doxamarkets-first-experiment-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#didomi-as-doxamarkets-first-experiment-3\"></a>Didomi as Doxamarket‚Äôs First Experiment</h2>\n<p>As the first experimental information market on Doxa, Didomi will grant users the ability to speculate $DEGEN on the winners of Optimism‚Äôs <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/proposals\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mission Request Round 2</a>. <strong>Didomi will open today as a multi-option contract market within Farcaster frames and will close on April 24th 7pm UTC.</strong> The market close is scheduled one day before the OP grant council releases final scores.
