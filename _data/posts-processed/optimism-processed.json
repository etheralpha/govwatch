The target assets include real-world assets (RWAs), yield-bearing DeFi tokens that are simple in structure, and staked ETH.</p>\n<p>This mission is specifically designed to incentivize the importation of $70,000,000 of yield-bearing assets to Optimism. Assets that are bridged into Optimism and then subsequently deposited into DeFi protocols will target a 5% annualized reward incentive (in OP) on top of whatever native yield is produced by the DeFi protocol and underlying asset. This program is intended to only cover assets that are permissionless in their transfers between addresses.</p>\n<p>Requirements to be whitelisted should be minimal, and whitelisting is mainly to avoid subsidizing scams and to assist in tracking assets.</p>\n<p>Users may not earn rewards simultaneously through this Mission and <a href=\"https://bytemasons.notion.site/SuperFest-Brief-197db2e173794491be0d6f1c4afbcc8e\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Superfest</a>, which is funded through the Foundation. If an eligible asset is bridged to Optimism and then deposited into an eligible DeFi protocol, this Mission cannot provide that user with rewards until the Foundation-funded incentives are depleted or ended.

Random sampling does not guarantee that a particular sample is a perfect representation of the population, but rather allows for valid conclusions to be drawn about the entire population based on the sample. Another way of saying this is that the random sample approximates the full population. This is due to the equal probability of selection.</p>\n<p>This method is widely used in a variety of disciplines when little is known about the entire population and/or extracting information from the entire population would be costly or infeasible. This is a powerful tool when considering the expansion of Citizenship and the increase in the number of rounds per year.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Does random sampling presuppose Citizens are interchangable? - <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393/6\">joanbp</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It doesn‚Äôt! In fact, it makes no assumptions about Citizens at all, which is why one of the major advantages of random sampling is the reduction of bias that can occur via subsets selected in any other way. Opt-in methods are particularly susceptible to various biases and can create opportunities for capture by a small, active, and likely unrepresentative subset. Random sampling <strong>only</strong> assumes that each participant had an equal probability of selection.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"why-use-random-sampling-now-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#why-use-random-sampling-now-3\"></a>Why use random sampling now?</h3>\n<p>Some of the most common <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA\">feedback</a> in Round 3 was the need to more effectively scale the Retro Funding process (it was too time consuming for badgeholders!) and to provide more predictability for builders. There are a variety of measures we are introducing to address this feedback, including more frequent and narrowly scoped rounds. When scaling to four rounds per year (a 4x increase), we felt it was important to keep the expectation on badgeholder time relatively fixed (or even to reduce it.) Allowing badgeholders to opt-in to rounds limits the number of voices that are heard and may skew or bias the results towards a small subset of Citizens that are able to dedicate the most time. Full participation in all rounds, on the other hand, demands too much time and effort of the whole group. By requiring full badgeholder participation in two rounds and splitting participation between the other two rounds using random sampling, we believe we can achieve this goal. Throughout Season 6, we plan to experiment with random sampling as an alternate or additional method to reduce the workload required of any one badgeholder. More on why we believe this is a worthwhile experiment below.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"why-random-sampling-specifically-in-the-citizens-house-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#why-random-sampling-specifically-in-the-citizens-house-4\"></a>Why random sampling, specifically in the Citizens‚Äô House?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Should only the most highly engaged Citizens be selected to participate? - <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-announcing-guest-voter-participation/8393/4\">gonna</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Token House scales via political representation, which while increasing participation and (potentially) context, also concentrates power. Delegation increases participation but concentrates power among large delegates.  In this context, elected Councils, which delegate decision making power over specific decisions to a one member/one vote Council, can actually <em>reduce</em> <em>the concentration of power in the Token House</em>. A weakness of this model, which we will have to actively combat, is that it‚Äôs easy for the ~50 most highly engaged delegates to become responsible for making most decisions.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the Citizens‚Äô House operates via a one Citizen, one vote model which distributes power <strong>evenly</strong> among the Citizenry, appearing much closer to a democracy. Elections, delegation, and/or other <strong>political scaling methods</strong> will concentrate power in the Citizens‚Äô House. The downsides of these approaches in traditional democracies are thoroughly outlined in <a href=\"https://politicalscience.yale.edu/publications/open-democracy-reinventing-popular-rule-twenty-first-century\">Open Democracy</a>. One of <a href=\"https://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/h-l-ne-landemore\">H√©l√®ne Landemore‚Äôs</a> main hypotheses is that random sampling (sortition) can be used to avoid these downsides without a meaningful impact on collective outputs (paraphrased.)</p>\n<p>Reducing the concentration of power is one of the main <a href=\"https://community.optimism.io/docs/citizen-house/\">goals</a> of the Citizens‚Äô House and random sampling is a well tested method that could allow the Citizens‚Äô House to avoid a common failure mode of other governance systems: capture by a small subset or minority interest. Accordingly, we believe it is worth experimenting with random sampling to enable the Citizens‚Äô House to scale <strong>by using statistical, rather than political, methods.</strong> With power evenly distributed among Citizens, the Citizens‚Äô House may serve as a more effective check on the Token House.</p>\n<p>In short, the intention is not that sampling be representative of a smaller subset of a certain type of Citizens, but rather to approximate a response from the entire Citizenry. High context, highly engaged Citizens should absolutely be recognized, rewarded, and respected within the Collective. Random sampling is not at odds with any of those objectives though!</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439","pubDate":"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 10:44:32 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8439"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-random-sampling-in-the-citizens-house/8439.rss","#text":"Experimenting with Random Sampling in the Citizens' House"},"filter":false},{"title":"Optimism Forum Weekly Recap - daospace: 06/24 - 06/30","dc:creator":"daospace","category":"Updates  and Announcements üì¢","description":"<p>gm Optimism Collective <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":red_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":red_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12\" title=\":sparkles:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":sparkles:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>This week saw a surge in forum activity with 22 new topics covering a wide range of discussions and initiatives‚Ä¶ Key highlights include discussions on evaluating airdrop effectiveness with metrics like user acquisition and economic impact, the introduction of the Bleu Assistant AI for providing information about the Optimism Collective, and inquiries about achieving unified liquidity in the OP Stack Superchain.

The target assets include real-world assets (RWAs), yield-bearing DeFi tokens that are simple in structure, and staked ETH.</p>\n<p>This mission is specifically designed to attract high-quality RWAs and structured DeFi products by lowering the cost of acquiring a credit rating for promising projects determined by the Grants Council Audit Committee.</p>\n<p>Recently, ratings agencies have been willing to engage with crypto projects to provide ratings. These ratings help investors in those projects review the quality of the offering, and increase confidence because structured finance professionals have done diligence on the fund. While not a promise of good returns, it helps traders and investors quickly ascertain that a project is not a scam or clearly untenable asset structure.</p>\n<p>Ratings, however, are not cheap, and many new projects are not able to easily afford a full rating. This mission is structured to be similar to the current smart contract auditing subsidies administered by the Grants Council. Projects are expected to share in the costs of their rating, but subsidies will be made available for whitelisted providers.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"s6-intent-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#s6-intent-3\"></a>S6 Intent</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-intents-ratification/8104\">Intent 3: Grow application devs on the Superchain</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposing-delegate-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#proposing-delegate-4\"></a>Proposing Delegate</h2>\n<p>GFX Labs</p>\n<h2><a name=\"proposal-tier-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#proposal-tier-5\"></a>Proposal Tier</h2>\n<p>Scales up to tier of proposer</p>\n<h2><a name=\"baseline-grant-amount-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#baseline-grant-amount-6\"></a>Baseline Grant Amount</h2>\n<p>200k OP total is requested for this program.

He committed to designing the S6 internal operating procedures, and completed this task flawlessly. Thank you, Dane, for your dedication and exceptional work. Your efforts have set a high standard for our council, and we are immensely grateful for your contributions.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"grants-council-internal-operating-procedure-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#grants-council-internal-operating-procedure-1\"></a>Grants Council Internal Operating Procedure</h2>\n<p>The internal procedures in this document govern the activities of the Season 6 Grants Council. The document sets forth the processes the Review Teams will follow in order to screen applications and conduct a formal review of proposals submitted for grants.</p>\n<p><strong>Review Teams</strong></p>\n<p>In the rules below, the Review Teams shall be the Superchain Review Team, the Optimism Mission Review Team, and the Audit and Special Mission Review Team.</p>\n<p>The Milestones and Metrics Team will be a standards team and will not provide a graded review of proposals, other than as specified below or in the charter, in the regular course.</p>\n<p><strong>Cycle Review Procedure</strong></p>\n<p>Each Cycle will have two periods, a Submission Period and a Decision Period.</p>\n<p>The Submission Period is designed to accommodate the submission and fair review of applications. This period is designed to enable an initial review of submissions in advance of the Decision Period.</p>\n<p>The Decision Period is designed to facilitate efficient, sound and diligent grants decisions.</p>\n<p>The Cycle Procedure is set forth in detail in the sections that follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard and Procedures for Review Teams</strong></p>\n<p>Each of the three Review Teams will conduct three stages of review within each cycle: an Intake Review; a Preliminary Review; and a Final Review.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Intake Review Standards and Procedures</strong></em></p>\n<p>The first form of review for a given proposal will be an Intake Review. The Intake Review will be a sufficiency review, conducted to eliminate proposals that do not adhere to minimum assessment standards from the later review stages of a given cycle.</p>\n<p>The first reviewer assigned to a proposal shall take one of two actions after an initial review of the proposal, either confirm that the proposal meets the minimum standards for review or reject the proposal for substantive review. A reviewer may reject a proposal for substantive review on one of the following grounds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The proposal has been marked ready for submission but has not been completed;</li>\n<li>The proposal lacks sufficient detail for the reviewer to address each item set forth on the relevant review rubric;</li>\n<li>The proposal breaches the Grant Policies or Rules of Engagement for the Optimism Collective;</li>\n<li>The proposal has a clear lack of clarity or effort that it would be premature to review for substance;</li>\n<li>The proposal is not aligned with the mission request objective;</li>\n<li>The proposal request is above the author‚Äôs tier;</li>\n<li>The author does not answer questions within 48 hours of intake;</li>\n<li>The OP distribution is not clear or developed;</li>\n<li>The project is not deployed and deployment is a critical feature of assessing the merit of the project; or,</li>\n<li>The application is trying to circumvent grant restrictions set forth by the Optimism Collective</li>\n<li>The application is not for OP Mainnet (Except Intent 3B applications)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reviewers shall have the discretion to select any of the above criteria as grounds for rejection.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Preliminary Review Standards and Procedures</strong></em></p>\n<p>If a reviewer determines that a proposal passes the Intake Review, a Preliminary Review will follow. The same reviewer will review the proposal and assign a score based on the relevant Review Rubric for the line of review.</p>\n<p>A reviewer may revisit a proposal that has been updated during the Submission Period to update the score based on any new edits. It is the responsibility of the proposer to notify the relevant Review Team that an edit has been made, and edits may only be considered if time permits during the cycle.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Final Review Standards and Procedures</strong></em></p>\n<p>During the Final Review, the Milestone and Metrics and / or Lead will provide a list of proposals that exceeded the cutoff score specified in the Review Rubric for each line of review. The proposals will then be assigned to two other reviewers on the relevant Review Team to be reviewed in order of Preliminary Review score (highest to lowest). Each reviewer will review the proposal and provide questions or feedback to the proposer. Based on the volume of applications, the Lead will set a date at which proposals will be considered final and no further changes will be considered. At this point, each reviewer will finalize scores.</p>\n<p>Each Review Team will review the list of proposals ordered by an average of the two highest scores received (between the one Preliminary Review and two Final Reviews). Each reviewer will then have the opportunity to agree with the final ranked list or object to specific rankings. If there is an objection to the specific ranking, the relevant proposal will be reviewed by each reviewer on the Review Team and the proposal will receive the average of score of all of the reviewers (including any updated score from the preliminary reviewer).</p>\n<p>Once the Review Team agrees to the ranked list of final scores, the team shall vote on the number of proposals (n) to be named finalists. The number shall be confirmed by a simiple majority of the Review Team. Proposals ranked 1-n shall be named finalists for the cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Review Procedures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Intake Review</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Milestone and Metrics Team and / or Lead shall endeavor to assign proposals for Intake Review chronologically, with the earlier submitted proposals being reviewed first.</p>\n<p>If a proposer challenges the reviewer‚Äôs Intake Review determination, the determination will stand for the relevant cycle; however, the Milestone and Metrics Team will consider the objection and review whether the proposer gave due consideration and a reasonable ground for rejection and document the result. The Milestone and Metrics Team may choose to make the results of the objections and determinations available to the community in advance of any future elections.</p>\n<p>If a proposer does not pass Intake Review, no substantive review will follow in a given cycle unless the proposer affirmatively reapplies in a subsequent cycle. The Milestones and Metrics Team or Lead will notify proposers that their proposals did not pass the Intake Review by the end of the Decision Period.</p>\n<p>The Milestone and Metrics Team and / or Lead shall track which reviewer manages the Intake Review in a given cycle and endeavor to assign a different reviewer for Intake Review in a subsequent cycle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Preliminary Review</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reviewers are encouraged to provide feedback to projects; however, priority should be given to projects that [are within 2 points of passing to the Final Review]. Reviewers are not required to provide feedback during the Preliminary Review, but the Milestone and Metrics Team should endeavor to assess how frequently reviewers provide comments during this period.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Final Review</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Proposals that proceed to the Final Review in one cycle will be considered in the Final Review of each subsequent cycle <em>unless</em> the relevant Review Team votes to require the proposer to reapply for further consideration. Requiring reapplication should be reserved for circumstances in which some core aspect of the application would need to change for the Review Team to view the proposal as being competitive.</p>\n<p>Feedback should be provided to each proposal that reaches the Final Review. If a proposal reaches the Final Review in a given cycle by default, feedback may be reiterated or updated based on the degree to which the proposal is updated or remains the same as it had in the prior cycle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Timing</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, for each cycle, the Submission Period will last one week and the Decision Period will last two weeks. The Council may amend the duration of each period by a simple majority vote.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Review Rubrics</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the beginning of each cycle (not later than the end of the cycle‚Äôs Submission Period), each Review Team will publish a rubric for the relevant lines of review that apply for the cycle. Generally, a line of review refers to a mission or other request for grant proposal that applies to the Review Team.</p>\n<p>Rubrics should articulate the categories of review for a line of review, the number of points a category may receive, and the factors that differentiate scores within each category. Each rubric should specify a cutoff score for a project to reach the Final Review.</p>\n<p>The Lead may designate reviewers to manage the drafting and proposed revisions to a given rubric. Rubrics and amendments shall be approved by a simple majority vote of the relevant Review Team.</p>\n<p><strong>Team Procedures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Superchain Team</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Superchain Team will consist of the three reviewers with the highest vote count in the reviewer election. A reviewer may elect to step down from the Superchain Team at the beginning of the Season. If a reviewer steps down, the reviewer with the next highest vote count will automatically become a member of the Superchain Team and the departing reviewer will become a member of the Optimism Mission Team. The Lead will confirm any changes on the governance forum for the Optimism Collective promptly.</p>\n<p>The Superchain Team may adopt Review Rubrics or amend its own procedures (to the extent that they do not conflict with the Grants Council Season 6 Charter or these Internal Operating Procedures) by a 2/3 vote.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Audit and Special Mission Review Team</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the beginning of each Cycle, the Lead shall coordinate with the Lead of the Developer Advisory Board to designate a reviewer from the Developer Advisory Board.</p>\n<p>Any Special Mission shall be designated a Special Mission at the beginning of a cycle by the Lead, provided a simple majority vote of the Optimism Mission Review Team votes in favor of the designation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone and Metrics Team</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Milestones and Metrics Team will be responsible for assessing and tracking milestones for grants that have reached the Final Review as well as finalists from prior seasons. The Milestone and Metrics team will designate a visible space for the community to view its determination on milestones.</p>\n<p><em>Prospective Proposals</em></p>\n<p>In order to be considered as a finalist, a proposal must include critical milestones. Critical milestones are intended to show good faith effort and a baseline of success toward the goals articulated in the grant proposal.</p>\n<p>The Milestone and Metrics Team will confirm Milestone Guidelines for assessing milestone sufficiency at the beginning of the Season by majority vote of the Team. The Milestone Guidelines will be aimed at creating discrete, trackable milestones for each successful proposal.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of each Final Review for each cycle, the Milestones and Metrics Team will review each proposal selected by each Review Team for Final Review to determine whether the proposal‚Äôs milestones meet the standard of sufficiency set forth in the Milestones Guidelines.</p>\n<p>In order to be eligible to become a finalist, a proposal must receive a favorable vote of a majority of the Milestones and Metrics Team members verifying that the proposal‚Äôs milestones meet the standards of sufficiency.</p>\n<p><em>Past Proposals</em></p>\n<p>The Milestones and Metrics Team shall make recommendations to the Foundation or Optimism Collective as to whether or not to proceed with the remainder of a grant from a prior Season. In general, the Milestones and Metrics Team shall not recommend proceeding with a project unless all critical milestones have been achieved (per the vote of the Team).</p>\n<p>The Milestone and Metrics Team is generally responsible for voting on whether or not milestones have been achieved. In circumstances where the Team determines that it would require expertise beyond the capacity of the Team, the Milestone and Metrics Team Lead may submit a milestone for consideration of the Team that originally voted to designate the proposal as a prior finalist. In such cases, the majority vote of the relevant team shall be considered determinative.</p>\n<p><em>Standard procedure</em></p>\n<p>Proposals for the continuation of a grant should be submitted to the Milestones Hub.</p>\n<p>In general, proposals will be reviewed only after a project confirms that all relevant critical milestones have been completed. However, the Milestone and Metrics Team may consider requests to review individual milestones in the case that a project requires feedback on a milestone to continue.</p>\n<p>Absent an approval for a greater amount of time, critical milestones will be considered past due after six months from the delivery of the grant for Experiments proposals and twelve months from the locking of the grant for Builders proposals.</p>\n<p>Milestones and Metrics votes shall be recorded.</p>\n<p><em>Other procedures</em></p>\n<p>In cases where a project has failed to complete its critical milestones in the allotted time (either the six or twelve month defaults for legacy Experiments and Builders or the time allotted on the specific proposal, whichever is greater), the Team will default to recommending against proceeding with any further steps of the grant.</p>\n<p>In the case where a proposer makes a proposal to change the substance (or extend the time) of a critical milestone, the Team may consider the change only if (a) the Team determines that there is substantial good reason to support the request and (b) at least 66% of all of the Council reviewers vote in favor of the proposal.</p>\n<p>For milestones pertinent to the Audit and Special Missions Team, the Team shall wait for the Developer Advisory Board to confirm the completion of the critical milestones prior to confirming completion to the Foundation.</p>\n<p>At any point, if the Council becomes aware of a matter that should be recommended for a code of conduct violation, the Council may revoke its recommendation to move forward with a grant.</p>\n<p>The guidance in this section yields to any contrary rule, guidance, or vote from Token House or the Foundation.</p>\n<p><em>Reviewer Metrics Accountability</em></p>\n<p>The Milestone and Metrics team will adopt any specific metrics and processes as mandated by the charter.</p>\n<p><strong>Official Record and Rule Changes</strong></p>\n<p>The Council will maintain a tracker of proposals considered, finalists named, milestones for finalists, and the progress / completion of milestones.</p>\n<p>On a bi-weekly basis, the Council may review the effectiveness of its internal procedures and make proposals for improvement. The Council can amend the internal procedures by a simple majority vote of the members of the Council; and, each Team may amend the internal procedures that pertain to the specific Team (insofar as the amendment does not conflict with the Season 6 Charter or these Internal Operating Procedures) by a simple majority vote of the Team. Any amendment to these Internal Operating Procedures must be recorded as a comment to this post and reflected on the Landing Page. It is recommended that the Team defer the effectiveness of an amendment until the next review cycle, unless the amendment creates a critical improvement to the review process.</p>\n<p><strong>Rules of Decision</strong></p>\n<p>If one or more Team members abstains from a vote, a vote will pass by the simple majority vote of the remaining members, provided there are more than one voting members remaining. If only one member of a Team votes, the result will be to take no action on the proposed matter. For instance, if the matter being voted on relates to whether or not to include an application in the final review, the result will be not to include the application in the final review.</p>\n<p>Any Council-wide votes must include members of each Team to achieve a quorum.</p>\n<p>The Lead may correct any clear errors in the Internal Procedures or resolve any conflicting provisions. For resolving conflicts, the Lead may submit a question about the best resolution to a vote of the Team members, the results of which may be recorded on the Landing Page.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedure-season-6/8424\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedure-season-6/8424","pubDate":"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 00:47:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8424"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedure-season-6/8424.rss","#text":"Grants Council Internal Operating Procedure - Season 6"},"filter":false},{"title":"Zenbit Logs - Builder Communication Thread","dc:creator":"Zenbit","category":"Updates  and Announcements üì¢","description":"<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6f4976d3e338c36b806ac96da111fb458841138b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fSuowdQM8LLJcIJJSWl48GD1Cwb.png?dl=1\" title=\"Zenbit\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6f4976d3e338c36b806ac96da111fb458841138b_2_690x230.png\" alt=\"Zenbit\" data-base62-sha1=\"fSuowdQM8LLJcIJJSWl48GD1Cwb\" width=\"690\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/6/6f4976d3e338c36b806ac96da111fb458841138b_2_690x230.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6f4976d3e338c36b806ac96da111fb458841138b.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/6/6f4976d3e338c36b806ac96da111fb458841138b.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"1A475D\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"tl-dr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#tl-dr-1\"></a>TL, DR</h2>\n<p>Zenbit is an R&amp;D laboratory building public goods for cities.

Ongoing OP projects:</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>OP city:</strong> A research and implementation of the OP stack to develop a rollup dedicated to cities. It integrates functionalities for Large Language Models (LLM) inferences in public data processing through <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17555\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimistic Machine Learning (opML)</a> and provides privacy tools via ZK and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15006\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimistic Privacy-Preserving AI (oppAI)</a>. We will research the compatibility of the OP stack‚Äôs Canon Fault Proof VM with the opML‚Äôs Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The goal is to implement a custom Fault Dispute Game that manages the challenges related to data availability states from the L2 rollup and the computation results from the Deep Neural Networks (DNN) of the multi-phase opML. This project was proposed in collaboration with Dr. Cathie for a <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-1306815702055122\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Builders Grant during Season 5</a> in Intent 1: Progress towards technical decentralization, which was <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-22-final-grants-roundup/8086\">granted during cycle 22</a>.
