Collected artifacts are not only relevant to Retro round 4, but will be essential to inform future rounds such as Retro Funding 7: Dev Tooling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Github Repo verification: Ownership over a Github repo is verified by asking the user to add a JSON file with a unique identifier to their repo. This verification method has been established by <a href=\"http://drips.network\">Drips.network</a> and we’re excited to build on this standard.</li>\n<li>Contract verification: Ownership over a contract, or set of contracts, is verified by asking the user to provide a message which has been signed by the deployer address of the contract(s). We’re building an additional solution for contract verification in collaboration with Opensource Observer, as some projects might have lost access to their deployer address</li>\n<li>NPM packages: A project can provide a reference to one or multiple NPM packages</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"sign-in-with-farcaster-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#sign-in-with-farcaster-4\"></a>Sign in with Farcaster</h2>\n<p>The first thing applicants will notice when using the new Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) sign up flow is that they are asked to sign in with Farcaster instead of connecting a wallet. We’re making this change for a few reasons.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"learnings-from-previous-retro-funding-applications-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#learnings-from-previous-retro-funding-applications-5\"></a>Learnings from previous Retro Funding applications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Account recovery: In past rounds, we noticed that applicants submitted their application with an Ethereum address and later wanted to change the address with which to manage the application. Without a separate user account identifier it is impossible to swap out the Ethereum address associated with an applicant. Additionally, the Foundation does not want to manually manage account recovery, because this would effectively give it centralized control over user accounts.</li>\n<li>Persistent identity: We want individuals to be able to build a persistent identity within the Optimism Collective, as part of Retro Funding and beyond. For example, we want attestations like “this person was on a team that was granted Retro Funding Round 3” to persist to an individual even if they want to rotate their keys or have lost access to their Ethereum account (see above). Project identities are distinct from individual identities and will be covered below.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"why-farcaster-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#why-farcaster-6\"></a>Why Farcaster?</h3>\n<p>The Optimism Collective could solve the above two problems by creating unique account identifiers and enabling Retro Funding applicants to create an Optimism account that is recoverable and persists even with key rotation. However, the Farcaster protocol already supports this functionality, and as an Optimism-native project, it has gained adoption from a large number of Optimism builders. We’re excited to build on shared standards and open source protocols rather than duplicating functionality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Existing identity: Retro Funding applicants that already have a Farcaster account will be able to get started in a couple of clicks instead of having to rebuild their profile (avatar, name, bio, social links). The account <a href=\"https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/guides/writing/verify-address\">verifications functionality</a> of the Farcaster protocol enables users to import important elements of their identity (NFTs, ENS) from their other Etherum accounts, and can also be used to import attestations if and when relevant. For example, the voting badge lives in Citizens’ Ethereum accounts, and can be connected to a Farcaster profile via the verifications feature in the Warpcast app. New attestations issued as part of Retro Funding signup will refer to individuals’ <a href=\"https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/contracts/reference/id-registry\">Farcaster ids</a> as part of the attestation schema, rather than utilizing the ‘recipient’ field, which will remain null.</li>\n<li>Integrated social graph: In the past Retro Funding round, more than 50% of initial applications were spam and had to be manually reviewed by Citizens ahead of voting. As a programme that will be the continued target of Sybil attacks and spam, Retro Funding can benefit from plugging into the Farcaster social graph. There are several teams already working on Sybil-detection within the Farcaster network - these efforts can be leveraged for future Retro Funding application experiences.</li>\n<li>What if I don’t have a Farcaster account?: To keep scope minimal for this first build, applicants will have to go to Farcaster to create an account before they can create a project and apply for Retro Funding 4. In the future, we hope to enable applicants to connect an Ethereum account in the sign-up process and we’ll <a href=\"https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts\">register a new Farcaster id</a> to the Ethereum account so users don’t have to leave the app.</li>\n<li>Establishing Identity: We strongly encourage everyone to consider the benefits of maintaining a single identity for activities across the superchain. In the future, attestations and other reputational signals may be used to flag potential Sybils, identify possible citizens, and select candidates for bounties among others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"creating-projects-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#creating-projects-7\"></a>Creating Projects</h2>\n<p>The second thing applicants will notice in the Retro Funding 4 application flow is that they will be asked to create a project before submitting an application. This minor change requires an update in the mental model. Projects ≠ applications. A project is run by an individual or multiple individuals and is something that creates impact within the Optimism Collective.</p>\n<p>A project can be as small as a hackathon project or as big as an app built by a large organization. The important thing is that projects are things that have quantifiable impact on Optimism and are assessed during Retro Funding rounds for impact within specific time periods defined in the round. Applications, on the other hand, are a submission of a project for funding in a specific round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"learnings-from-previous-retro-funding-applications-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#learnings-from-previous-retro-funding-applications-8\"></a>Learnings from previous Retro Funding applications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Project identity: Previously, projects did not build a persistent identity across Optimism touch points such as Token House grant applications and Retro Funding, or even between Retro Funding rounds. The same project would have to re-enter the same basic information when submitting the Retro Funding application for each round. In past rounds, attestations that were really about projects were made about the individual Ethereum accounts that submitted the application, rather than about the project itself. This made it really difficult to track the development of projects over time and the people contributing to them. Similar to how we want to enable individuals to develop a persistent identity within Optimism, we also want projects to have a persistent identity. Instead of entering the same data over again for every Retro Funding round, projects will be evergreen and continue to persist between and across rounds. This also enables projects to build up a reputation by consistently creating impact and receiving funding, and for individuals to build up their own reputation by being part of the team of a successful project.</li>\n<li>Changes to the project’s team: In past Retro Funding rounds, there were several cases where an individual team member submitted an application for Retro Funding and then left the team before voting was completed and could no longer manage the application. By separating the applicant from the project, we make it possible for projects to be run by multiple people, and for those people to change over time. Each project will have one or more contributors, whose roles can change over time as people join and leave the project. The initial release will include a simple off-chain mapping of team members to projects, with the goal of moving this on-chain in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes are being released as part of Round 4 with the expectation that they will form the foundation of the identity layer of the stack that will grow and evolve over time. However, everything we build is iterative so it is possible that changes will be rolled-back or adapted based on learnings with each subsequent iteration.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"other-improvements-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#other-improvements-9\"></a>Other improvements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Funding &amp; Grant information: based on feedback in Retro round 3, the application process collects relevant information on different funding &amp; grants a project has received, including VC funding.</li>\n<li>Email changes &amp; project admin: In Retro Funding 3, we have found that many projects needed to change their email address after applying, or lost access to the address which they used to apply. In case a user loses access to their address they can leverage Farcaster’s account recovery feature. A user is always able to update their email address within their profile. Please note: The Optimism Foundation will not be able to recover profiles for which access to the relevant Farcaster account has been fully lost. The designs of the sign-up process aim to communicate this very clearly</li>\n<li>Shortened Application window: The application window has been shortened to 14 days from 31 days in Retro Funding 3, see<a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988\"> here</a> for more details.</li>\n<li>Stronger Eligibility Criteria: Stronger eligibility criteria have been defined based on feedback from Retro Funding 3, see<a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988\"> here</a> for more details.</li>\n</ol>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013","pubDate":"Wed, 24 Apr 2024 12:47:05 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8013"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013.rss","#text":"Retro Funding 4: Application process"},"filter":false},{"title":"Retro Funding: Application Review Process","dc:creator":"system","category":"🔴 Retro Funding","description":"<p><em>Special thanks to Sov from Gitcoin and DisruptionJoe from Plurality Labs for review &amp; input and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/joanbp\">@joanbp</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/griff\">@Griff</a> for feedback as part of the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863\">Feedback Commission</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This post outlines a framework for the application review process of future Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) rounds and its application to Retro Funding 4. The application review process is applied to decide which applicants are eligible to participate in retro rounds and is used to enforce application rules and eligibility criteria.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"learnings-from-retro-funding-3-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#learnings-from-retro-funding-3-1\"></a><strong>Learnings from Retro Funding 3</strong></h3>\n<p>You can find an overview of the Retro Funding 3 application review process <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-application-review-process/6916\">here</a> and its learnings <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA\">here</a>. Below you find a summary of the main learnings from the application review process in Retro Funding 3:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The optimistic approach (e.g. a project first needs to be reported) lead to an increase in operational effort. Due to:<br>\na. There being no incentive for community members to review all applications and report malicious ones<br>\nb. There being no effective way of tracking which applications have already been reviewed or reported</li>\n<li>Reviewers sometimes applied criteria outside of application rules (e.g. subjective judgements on who should participate) or applied rules inconsistently across cases.</li>\n<li>A large amount of obvious spam submissions required review by multiple humans</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"application-review-process-framework-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#application-review-process-framework-2\"></a><strong>Application Review process framework</strong></h2>\n<p>Based on learnings from past Retro rounds you can find our goals for iterating on the application review process below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Minimize human review</strong>: We received tons of obvious spam in Retro Funding 3, which all needed to be reviewed by at least 5 humans. In this iteration, we aim to rely more on automated filtering of low quality submissions…</li>\n<li><strong>Minimize duplicate work:</strong> In Retro Funding 3, each application was reviewed by multiple volunteers who could report the application for rule violations. This uncoordinated approach lead to duplicate work. We aim to minimize duplicate work by relying on clear roles and responsibilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Maximize consistency of rule enforcement</strong>: In Retro Funding 3, rules were subjectively applied by randomly selected badgeholders, which lead to a difference in rule application across cases. We aim to provide more consistency in how rules are applied.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"proposed-process-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#proposed-process-overview-3\"></a>Proposed Process overview</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Retro Funding eligibility criteria and application rules are established</strong><br>\n1.1 <strong>Eligibility criteria</strong>: For each Retro Funding round, there are pre-defined eligibility criteria. This sets expectations to builders and minimizes the amount of non-qualifying applications. Ideally, eligibility criteria are enforced in the sign up process.<br>\n1.2 <strong>Application rules</strong>: For each Retro Funding round, there is a set of application rules (ideally standardised across rounds), which applications must adhere to. Violating these rules will result in exclusion from the Retro Funding round.</li>\n<li><strong>Application submission:</strong> Retro Funding applicants submit their applications by a certain deadline. After this deadline, applications are final and can no longer be edited.</li>\n<li><strong>Application review Phase 1:</strong> Applications are excluded via automated filtering and badgeholder review<br>\n3.1. <strong>Automated filtering:</strong> To reduce manual human review of applications, automation must be used to identify submissions which violate application rules or eligibility criteria. Identified applications might be automatically excluded, or flagged to badgeholders for review.<br>\n3.2 <strong>Badgeholder review:</strong> a set of badgeholders review applications for eligibility criteria and application rule violations.</li>\n<li><strong>Appeals</strong>: All applications which are excluded in review phase 1 get the chance to hand in an appeal. An appeal can refute the reasons for excluding the application, while application content can not be edited/changed.</li>\n<li><strong>Application review phase 2 (appeal review):</strong> Appeals are reviewed by a number of badgeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Application approval/rejection attestation</strong>: Following application review, attestations which indicate approval or rejection are issued for each Retro Funding application.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that application content is final following the application deadline. Allowing for edits following the deadline within the application review process could lead to a significant increase in operational effort and complexity.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"badgeholder-review-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#badgeholder-review-4\"></a>Badgeholder Review</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Badgeholders are asked to opt-in to participate in the application review process</li>\n<li>From the opt-in list, a number of badgeholders are randomly selected to participate, based on the expected number of applications to be reviewed</li>\n<li><strong>Application review Phase 1:</strong> All applications are reviewed by badgeholders to enforce eligibility criteria and application rules<br>\n3.1. <strong>Rule violations are flagged</strong>: Each badgeholder is presented with subset of applications and is tasked with reviewing them for meeting specific eligibility criteria and/or application rules. Each application is reviewed by at least two badgeholders.<br>\n3.2. <strong>Flagged rule violations are reviewed</strong>: If a badgeholder flags an application rule violation or failure to meet eligibility criteria, 4 other badgeholders will be asked to review the case and confirm. 3/5 badgeholders need to agree for an application to be excluded</li>\n<li><strong>Application Review Phase 2 (appeals)</strong><br>\n4.1. Each rejected application is notified of their opportunity to hand in an appeal<br>\n4.2. Each badgeholder is presented with a subset of the appeals cases and is tasked with reviewing each.<br>\n4.3. Each appeal is reviewed by 5 badgeholders, with 3/5 badgeholders needing to signal approval of the appeal to pass. The reviewing badgeholders should be different to the reviewing badgeholders in phase 1.<br>\n4.4 Appeals can only dispute reasons for exclusion, application content can not be changed. (e.g. “Oh sorry I was meant to report my grant but forgot to do so” is an invalid appeal).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"retro-funding-4-application-review-process-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#retro-funding-4-application-review-process-5\"></a>Retro Funding 4: Application review process</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Eligibility criteria and application rules are established</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Retro Funding application submissions</strong>: the sign up flow is enforcing some of the eligibility criteria (e.g. applicant needs to provide Github, onchain contracts etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Application review Phase 1</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Automated filtering:</strong> A number of applications should automatically be flagged and excluded, including:\n<ol>\n<li>Applications not meeting eligibility criteria</li>\n<li>Applications containing obv spam: In Retro Funding 4 this concerns project profile metadata (e.g. project name, picture, etc), project github repos (e.g. repo is empty, has been created shortly before applying, etc), project onchain contracts (contract have been newly deployed, contracts only have interactions from low reputation addresses, etc)</li>\n<li>Duplicate Applications, which include the same Github Repo or onchain contracts</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Human review:</strong> In Retro Funding 4, all applications (which haven’t been automatically excluded) need to be checked for correct reporting of grants and funding</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Appeals:</strong> All applicants excluded in review phase 1 can hand in an appeal</li>\n<li><strong>Application review phase 2 (appeals review):</strong> Appeals are reviewed by a number of badgeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Application approval/rejection attestation</strong>: Following application review, attestations which indicate approval or rejection are issued for each Retro Funding application.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"eligibility-criteria-retro-funding-4-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#eligibility-criteria-retro-funding-4-6\"></a><strong>Eligibility Criteria (Retro Funding 4)</strong></h3>\n<p>(See <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builders - round details</a>)<br>\nIn Retro Funding 3, the Retro Funding sign up process saw a large influx of spam and low-quality applications. By setting stronger eligibility criteria in Retro Funding 4, the Foundation aims to provide clarity to builders and reduce the amount of human review required for spam and low-quality application. In addition, qualifying criteria reduce the number of applicants who have not generated sufficient impact to receive rewards (such as the below requirement of a minimum number of unique address interactions). The below eligibility criteria aim to strike a balance between broad inclusivity and sufficient requirements to allow for an operationally viable Retro Funding round.</p>\n<p><strong>Builders are eligible who have</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deployed their onchain contracts on one or multiple of the following OP chains: OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Frax and Metal, and meet the following criteria:\n<ul>\n<li>Onchain contracts have interactions from 420 unique addresses during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contracts had their first transaction before April 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contract had more than 10 days of activity during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Verified their onchain contracts in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Made their contract code available in a public Github repo, for which ownership has been verified in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Confirmed that they will comply with Optimism Foundation KYC requirements and are not residing in a sanctioned country</li>\n<li>Submitted a Retro Funding application before June 6th, 2024 and comply with application rules</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"application-rules-retro-funding-4-draft-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#application-rules-retro-funding-4-draft-7\"></a>Application Rules (Retro Funding 4) DRAFT</h3>\n<p>Please note that the Application Rules are not final and might change.

An impactful event for our project, that changed it all! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>\n<p>Trying to be short and not steal a lot of everyone’s time, what brought me here is reading<br>\nthis topic : <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861/5\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Upcoming Retro rounds and their design - #5 by joanbp</a></p>\n<p>Having experienced RPGF3 as a participant project, i find a lot of smart decitions and improvements &lt;3. For instance making narrower rounds, or the experiments on new ways of measuring true impact.</p>\n<p>Having said that, and this is the other reason that brings me here, i must say I’m a bit sad<br>\nfor the fact that with the recent changes at the “Builder’s round” , (where education and onboarding is now a bit left aside, and redirected to the Token House Mission) now our project, Newtro, can’t apply to RPGF.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact we truly understand that sometimes measuring this kind of projects can be tricky<br>\n(there are a lot of fakes, and scams and whatnot) at the same time, there are good number of<br>\nimportant projects, legit and deeply recognized by the users who are impacted by them.<br>\nI think Newtro is one of them (but don’t worry, this is not us claiming to be included in the round, we just want to raise the alarm on some topics for future improvement!)</p>\n<p>Our work at educating, onboarding, and producing alongside artists with whom we can create<br>\ntrue palpable local impact, has been lovingly recognized at RPGF3 (with a big margin in the votes,<br>\nand 20k OP as a grant); highlighting our impact at the Zora blockchain, where we drove a significant<br>\nnumber of artists (more than a 100 since mid 2023, and growing each trimester), generating a lot of true and organic activity at the chain. This was the direct result of our “Arts &amp; W3b” free workshop for artists’ onboarding to the blockchain. We can say the same for the Farcaster ecosystem, and Base in a tangent way.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks to RPGF3, some of the things we could make were:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A trip with 15 artists to La Pampa (Argentina) to the VuelaPelucas3000 festival<br>\nhosted by Pamilo Ceirone (Argentinian artist who tokenizes his work) in December 2023, in order to participate at the event with projections, vjing and djing. It was a 3 day deeply moving days full of art and community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can check our summary of 2023 and this experience in this video at Zora:</p><aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xd109c101a5de94498440c863ff71747f8f97af02/7\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/41bfed5e2cb81b10b3c5d59bb791a476a16a3e1b_2_661x500.jpeg\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"8A7C71\" width=\"661\" height=\"500\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xd109c101a5de94498440c863ff71747f8f97af02/7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">zora.co</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:661/500;\"><img src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/optimized/2X/4/41bfed5e2cb81b10b3c5d59bb791a476a16a3e1b_2_661x500.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"8A7C71\" width=\"661\" height=\"500\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xd109c101a5de94498440c863ff71747f8f97af02/7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Newtro's 2023 Balance + Vuelapelucas mini doc</a></h3>\n\n  <p>2023 was a year full of experiences, friendship, excitement, culture and art for the Collective.\n\nCome share with us a little taste of the love that has been experienced, and, hopefully, get inspired with the collective spirit 💛</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An art residency at Epuyen (Chubut) in the Patagonian region of Argentina, in<br>\ncoproduction with the artists family of Bosquegracias.

Its also our intention to<br>\nstart to spread the word about what’s going on in our tokenized art niche, so thanks again for reading!</p>\n<p>We can say we are a testament of how to build a true, impactful cultural Arts &amp; Web3 project in the blockchain, full of art, knowledge exchange, local impact and organic growth, producing true measurable impact not only for our project, but also artists and blockchains, in a thriving territory as Latin America is in the web3 world. With some shyness, i can proudly say that sometimes we heard the words “The Newtro model”, something that humbled but also excited us a lot.</p>\n<p>Talks of being able to talk with other more recent artists’ Collectives to give a hand or advice,<br>\nor even share our knowledge with Mexican projects (!), ignited our flame and made us realize that soon, this is something we had to do. We take Culture and the promotion of arts and artists as serious as it is. And we are happy to share what we know. <strong>With the Artists Collectives, but also with whomever would find productive to hear us from the OP Collective.</strong></p>\n<p>But in order for this kind of projects (artists collectives trying to create onchain and offchain impact)<br>\nto thrive, as anyone else, we need financial support. We and our partners and sponsors know how hard we work, how much impact we conduct to the blockchain, off the chain, and how many artists lives we touch.</p>\n<p>That’s why i wanted to raise a bit my voice, and hopefully bring to light some concerns that im sure<br>\nwe are not the only ones experiencing, since the changes made at the Builder’s category of RPGF4.<br>\nWe are more than willing to <strong>keep sharing abt our experience, its importance, and its needs</strong>.I must say that we are thankful for the “Token House Missions” but its hard to create something lasting, cohesive and truly impactful just by hosting events from time to time.

In DAO governance’s reality though, only a handful of primitives achieved significant adoption. 1token1vote links voting power directly to the number of tokens held. Vote delegation allows token holders to assign their voting rights to another party, enabling concentrated decision-making power based on trust.</p>\n<p>There is a third class of voting mechanisms to complement these concepts: make a voter’s track record count in DAO decisions, and use proofs of expertise and achievements as a signal to define voting weight and decision-making power. In this experiment, TE Academy explores the potential of Reputation-based Weighted Voting in an educational project. Students will have the chance to go over the entire token engineering process and work on a case study with a real voting outcome - deciding on the winner of the first TE Academy fellowship with a $10K prize for the fellowship winner.</p>\n<p>Over the past 3 years, TE Academy has established a system of NFT proofs to track individual community members’ achievements and the development of the sector overall. We’ve issued more than 1000 NFTs to students who’ve passed knowledge requirements and to researchers with significant contributions to the token engineering discipline. In our experiment, any community member will be eligible to vote - however, holding Token Engineering NFTs will increase a voter’s weight in this decision. No popularity contest!</p>\n<p>We’ll account for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>passed exams in the TE Fundamentals course (more than <a href=\"https://tokenengineering.net/explore/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">4000 students enrolled</a>)</li>\n<li>sharing knowledge as a speaker at TE Academy events (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TE-Academy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">more than 120</a> over the last 3 years)</li>\n<li>contributions to our shared body of knowledge in the form of online learning materials (first <a href=\"https://tokenengineering.net/explore/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">bachelor-level course in token engineering</a>)</li>\n<li>supporting students as study group host (in one of 45 study groups)</li>\n<li>and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Reputation-based Weighted Voting can be applied to any DAO decision-making cases where expertise is required to make good decisions. In RWV systems, voters are encouraged to sharpen their profile and become highly sought-after experts in their domain of decisions (e.g. Retro-Public Goods Funding, Risk Management). For a DAO’s collective, it’s an opportunity to establish incentives for decision-makers and grant voting power to those who were actively involved in good decisions.<br>\nCombined with 1token1vote and vote delegation, it’s a new building block to make decisions transparent, and robust against collusion, bribery, and economic attacks.</p>\n<p>We offer this program as part of our public goods education, enabled by Optimism RetroPGF! <strong>The results of this experiment, as well as the voting algorithm and a simulation engine, will be available open-source.</strong></p>\n<p>Learn more about our program in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gQKKt755n6Y?si=XsTY2Iw_CaK2j4yU\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this presentation at the Optimism Demo Day</a>!</p>\n<p>Today, more than 4000 students are enrolled in TE Academy’s studying programs, and research initiatives.

By setting stronger eligibility criteria in Retro Funding 4, the Foundation aims to provide clarity to builders and reduce the amount of human review required for spam and low-quality application. In addition, qualifying criteria reduce the number of applicants who have not generated sufficient impact to receive rewards (such as the below requirement of a minimum number of unique address interactions). The below eligibility criteria aim to strike a balance between broad inclusivity and sufficient requirements to allow for an operationally viable Retro Funding round.</p>\n<p><strong>Builders are eligible who have</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deployed their onchain contracts on one or multiple of the following OP chains: OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, Mode, Frax and Metal, and meet the following criteria:\n<ul>\n<li>Onchain contracts have interactions from 420 unique addresses during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contracts had their first transaction before April 1st 2024</li>\n<li>Onchain contract had more than 10 days of activity during Jan 1st - May 1st 2024</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Verified their onchain contracts in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Made their contract code available in a public Github repo, for which ownership has been verified in the Retro Funding sign up process</li>\n<li>Confirmed that they will comply with Optimism Foundation KYC requirements and are not residing in a sanctioned country</li>\n<li>Submitted a Retro Funding application before June 6th, 2024 and comply with application rules</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"round-sizing-10m-op-to-reward-onchain-builders-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#round-sizing-10m-op-to-reward-onchain-builders-5\"></a>Round Sizing: 10m OP to reward Onchain Builders</h2>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 will allocated 10m OP to reward the impact of Onchain Builders. The OP token allocation for Retro Funding 4 should reflect the impact generated by onchain builders, as well as set a strong incentive for the continuous generation of demand for Optimism blockspace.<br>\nBelow you find some considerations which informed the Foundation’s round sizing decision:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Underallocation to Onchain Builders in Retro Funding 3:</strong> Previously, Retro Funding 3 allocated a total of <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">1.5M out of 30M OP</a> to the top 20% of applicants who generated network usage. There has been <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">strong feedback from badgeholders and community</a> members that this allocation was too low and should be increased in future rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Growth in developer activity since last round:</strong> The Collective is focused on growing the number of active onchain developers. Developer activity, across the Superchain, <a href=\"https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-chains-revenue-generating-deployer-addresses\">has seen a large increase over the past six months</a>. Thus, Retro Funding rewards to these types of contributions should increase to reflect this increase in impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Collective sustainability:</strong> In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders have <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">raised concerns around Retro Funding sustainability</a>. Retro Funding currently relies on the Retroactive Public Goods Funding token allocation of 850M OP for rewards. <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/PLrAQgE1EGRo7GRrFoztplFChnUZda4DFGW3dkQayxY\">In the future</a>, Retro Funding will rely on surplus protocol revenue as the source of rewards. Currently, <a href=\"https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity#op-collective-contribution\">Total Collective Contributions</a> (of surplus protocol revenue) fall short of what is needed to sustain Retroactive Public Goods Funding. Additionally, in Retro Funding 3, badgeholders raised points <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/new-rpgf3-distribution-disparity-data/7521\">around the relationship of rewards to the sequencer revenue</a>, to ensure rewards don’t exceed the sequencer revenue itself. By allocating a significant amount of OP to rewarding onchain builders, the Citizens’ House is incentivizing developer growth and increased network activity.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"future-round-sizing-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#future-round-sizing-6\"></a>Future round sizing</h3>\n<p>The Foundation will size Retro Funding 4 &amp; 5, and will proposes round sizes for Retro Funding 6 &amp; 7, to be ratified by the Citizens’ House. In the future, this process will gradually transition to be more community-led, which may involve the creation of a Budget Board, or similar, in future Seasons. Round sizing decisions are currently informed by the amount of impact observed within the Collective, considerations for incentivising contributors to take action, and sustainability of Retro Funding rewards. In the future, these decisions should be made based on a framework which takes a number of established measurements and criteria into. We invite Data NERDs to explore measurements and criteria which will inform governance participants to make informed budgeting decisions in the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"voting-design-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#voting-design-7\"></a>Voting design</h2>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 experiments with <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upcoming-retro-rounds-and-their-design/7861\">Metrics-based Evaluation</a>, with the hypothesis that by leveraging quantitive metrics, citizens are able to more accurately express their preferences for the types of impact they want to reward, as well as make more accurate judgements of the impact delivered by individual contributors.<br>\nIn stark contrast to other Retro Funding experiments, badgeholders will not vote on individual projects but will rather vote via selecting and weighting a number of metrics which measure different types of impact. You can find out more about prototypes and explorations that informed this design <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimentation-impact-metric-based-voting/7727\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact metrics</strong><br>\nAll Citizens will be asked to vote in Retro Funding 4 and will be invited to actively shape and input on the design of impact metrics via discussions on the forum as well as a workshop.

Selecting the right ecosystem projects to fund, which tokens to list in a lending market, and the outcome of a protocol fee switch are valuable propositions that affect all community stakeholders. Once the combined value at stake reaches a critical mass, the founding team is unable to make decisions by themselves without running the risk of centralization. As a result, many aspects of the decentralized protocol model make governance unavoidable.</p>\n<p>But token voting as a mechanism for decentralized governance has introduced its own <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">set of problems</a>. An inherent conflict of interest arises when voting power is disproportionately concentrated among a small group of wealthy token holders. As an example, venture funds or whales involved in external projects might be incentivized to pursue agendas that benefit their broader portfolio at the expense of the protocol’s long-term success. In addition, the over-reliance on token voting not only entrenches the power of a wealthy few but also undermines the collective action taken by smaller stakeholders. Smaller delegates within the Optimism ecosystem often <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2830772/4724839/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">refrain from voting</a> due to their individual decisions “not mattering much”. The situation creates a paradox where the promise of decentralization leads to a quasi-centralization of power and an absence of true preferences.</p>\n<p>Doxamarket aims to address these gaps by offering a novel approach to incentivize voter participation and mitigate the inefficiencies associated with governance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"information-markets-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#information-markets-2\"></a>Information Markets</h2>\n<p>Onchain information markets have gained immense popularity recently with the rise of <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Polymarket</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1775542217307791366\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">liquidity-backed Kalshi</a>. Their success confirms the financial value that assigning probabilities to future outcomes and sub outcomes can generate. Most importantly, we believe information markets carry an <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/04/01/dc.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">element of chaos</a> that could be directly applied to form consensus in decentralized governance. The crypto space will always prefer chaotic and decisive action over stasis debates between two protocol researchers. Integrating information markets into the onchain decision-making process introduces a novel way to financially incentivize token-voting, increase voter participation, and force true preferences from broader ecosystem participants.</p>\n<p>For the implementation of this idea, Doxamarket (formerly BetCaster) has <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-4085199193924518\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">received a grant of 50,000 OP</a> from Optimism’s Mission Request Round 1.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"didomi-as-doxamarkets-first-experiment-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#didomi-as-doxamarkets-first-experiment-3\"></a>Didomi as Doxamarket’s First Experiment</h2>\n<p>As the first experimental information market on Doxa, Didomi will grant users the ability to speculate $DEGEN on the winners of Optimism’s <a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/proposals\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mission Request Round 2</a>. <strong>Didomi will open today as a multi-option contract market within Farcaster frames and will close on April 24th 7pm UTC.</strong> The market close is scheduled one day before the OP grant council releases final scores.

CB is up for a grant with a <a href=\"https://www.jokerace.io/contest/optimism/0x8ad4e45082f269deb9187a7d8262d448a055c9f9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vote on Jokerace open to OP badgeholders</a> until April 10. Each badgeholder gets four votes. That’s a lot of dopamine.</p>\n<p>If you want another hit of the good stuff, you could provide feedback/criticism on the title of this post (I’m working on my “one line” pitch) or any of the larger picture laid out below. For either case I’m particularly interested in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you understand what the project is?</li>\n<li>Does it make sense as to why it’s worth building (or at least why I think it’s worth building)?</li>\n<li>What would you add?</li>\n<li>What would you remove?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Now then…</strong></p>\n<p>A meme was originally defined as the cultural equivalent of a gene - a unit of information within a social group that can replicate, evolve, and undergo natural selection. The theory gained some popularity in the 90’s but lost momentum due to the difficulty of agreeing on what actually constitutes a meme and how to measure cultural information.</p>\n<p>Internet memes define a structure and are easily tracked. <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/about\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Know Your Memes</a> has been doing so since 2008 in a format similar to wikipedia. Internet memes don’t represent complete cultures of course, but it’s a significant step for the theory.</p>\n<p>It seems like the next logical step in this progression is to create an app that allows memes to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be created, mutated, and replicated by groups</li>\n<li>Form links to incubate and grow into complex cultures</li>\n<li>Undergo selection processes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We could probably stop here and see some interesting results, but I think we can go a step further to clean the cultural slate and initiate a Cambrian Explosion of memetic activity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One human = one account at the gates to keep out bots and sybils</li>\n<li>Anonymizing users at the gates removes the influence of previous cultural links (friends, family, etc) on that user’s input. They still hold that cultural information in their minds, but the social pressure of identity and conformity is removed while in the app, so they are free to try on new hats and express themselves authentically.\n<ul>\n<li>As memes are co-created and cultures are formed, anonymous users can offer to share (or revoke) pieces of information with those they have interacted with, creating high value social data. Example: two parties offer to share info with a group they just made a dope meme with; the exchange is made and a new social connection is formed, anchored within a culture.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Memes can be minted to allow individuals to build their own cultural narratives. This creates another opportunity for social connections to happen. Example: when ten people mint the same meme give them an option to form a new culture as a group with that meme as a genesis block.</li>\n<li>Limiting how much time and data any individual can put into the system to about what the bottom 20% of active users would naturally contribute spreads the content more evenly, which means more diversely since every human has unique experiences and perspectives to throw in the blender.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If it works right, this could allow us to rapidly discover and develop new foundational layers of society that accurately represent the wants, needs, and desires of the population. And because everyone is working together to create these memes and cultures, they automatically start with a committed, decentralized, and aligned community.</p>\n<p>So, that’s the basic premise. <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/hedgey-rpgf-grants-final-project-updates/7841/6\">Here are some more details about what I’ve built the last month and plans for the future.</a> Considering the idea is all about co-creation and shared perspectives, I’ll stop here and curiously await some novel perspective from the OP cultural mind to move the narrative forward.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/culture-blocks-co-created-memes-that-can-be-linked-together-to-form-complex-cultures-and-social-graphs/7935\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/culture-blocks-co-created-memes-that-can-be-linked-together-to-form-complex-cultures-and-social-graphs/7935","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 16:37:17 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-7935"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/culture-blocks-co-created-memes-that-can-be-linked-together-to-form-complex-cultures-and-social-graphs/7935.rss","#text":"Culture Blocks - Co-created memes that can be linked together to form complex cultures and social graphs"},"filter":false},{"title":"Governor Update Proposal #1: Improve advanced delegation voting","dc:creator":"Agora","category":"Protocol Upgrade","description":"<h1><a name=\"executive-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#executive-summary-1\"></a>Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>Hi I’m Kent, CTO of Agora. Agora is the governance software company contributing to the Optimism token house governor and its frontend at <a href=\"http://vote.optimism.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vote.optimism.io</a>. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<p>This is a 1 line update to the governance smart contract of the token house that will allow the small subset of voters who have received their voting power from advanced delegation (a feature introduced in the last governor update) to vote by signing one transaction instead of two.</p>\n<p>If this vote passes, the Optimism foundation will upgrade governor contract to the new implementation Agora deployed shortly after the end of the veto period.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n<p>As part of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/64\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">the v2 upgrade of the token house</a> we shipped in December, we enabled a new feature called “advanced delegation”, which allows token holders to delegate their voting power to multiple delegates without splitting their balance. This facilitates governance participation for large funds, partners and the foundation, who have complex token storage requirements. One side effect of feature is that voters who received advanced delegation would need to sign two transactions to vote.</p>\n<p>When we shipped this feature, we thought having two transactions would be a good thing, to easily show users when they voted from each of their voting powers: standard delegation power and advanced delegation power.</p>\n<p>After getting feedback from a small group of ~50 voters who’ve received votes via this feature, it was clear that this was a bad idea. As a consequence, we have paused the further rollout of this feature and refactored the contract to allow for a vote with both standard and advanced delegation in one transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact to voters:</strong></p>\n<p>Delegates with advanced voting power will have a better user experience and will sign only 1 transaction.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"specifications-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#specifications-3\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<h2><a name=\"contract-changed-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#contract-changed-4\"></a>Contract Changed</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/voteagora/governor/pull/22/files\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism Governor</a> would be changed as part of this upgrade.

We’ve piloted the proof with Round 3. This post intends to explain the mechanics of the audit and also ask for feedback from the Optimism community.</p>\n<p><strong>The TLDR;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Retroactive Funding process and algorithm ideally improves with each round via governance feedback.</li>\n<li>We’ve essentially audited RetroPGF Round 3. We did so through a cryptographic proof, and anyone can verify it using this <a href=\"https://retrofunding.ezkl.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">webapp</a>.</li>\n<li>This paves the way for an end-to-end automated process with private voting, checks and balances on the allocation algorithm, and smart contract enabled allocation delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For stakeholders, this audit means many things:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For badgeholders, that your vote was fairly counted</li>\n<li>For recipients, that your allocation was fairly calculated</li>\n<li>For everyone else, the results actually correspond with the Optimism governance forums</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"an-iterative-approach-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#an-iterative-approach-1\"></a>An iterative approach</h3>\n<p>As this forum is aware, a core tenet of the Optimism community is agile iteration. That means the design of Round 3 looks much different from that of Round 1. We see that Round 3 heavily indexes on the impact evaluation framework, and as a both qualitative and quantitative measure, heavily relies on the judgement of voters (badgeholders).</p>\n<p>Votes are currently fed through an allocation algorithm, published publicly by the Optimism team. The team announces the algorithm’s results at the conclusion of a round, as well as learnings to iterate upon for the next rounds.</p>\n<p>The trickiest bit has always been effectively measuring impact. Reliance on quantitative metrics risks exclusion. Reliance of qualitative feedback risks human biases among other coordination challenges. And there are many more tradeoffs beyond these. Consequently, the algorithm and overarching design continues to evolve and evoke discussion. <strong>Ideally, we can check the process and algorithm with each new iteration.</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-integrity-challenge-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#the-integrity-challenge-2\"></a>The integrity challenge</h3>\n<p>One of the main tradeoffs for Retroactive Funding is related to privacy.</p>\n<p>For such a large pool of OP rewards, transparency is important. We want to ensure results are aligned with previous governance decisions. More importantly, this recognizes that many projects depend on the allocation for sustainability.</p>\n<p>However, badgeholder votes are private in Retroactive Funding. A longstanding feature of voting systems, this allows voters to express their true preferences without fear of retaliation, coercion, or pressure from others. It makes it difficult to execute vote buying, and encourages honest participation.</p>\n<p><strong>This presents a key challenge</strong>: verifying that allocation outcomes are truly based on badgeholder votes. Even though the allocation algorithm is public (and we can check that it accurately codifies forum promises), we can’t run a check without the input data. In the worst case, we can’t guarantee that the provided allocation algorithm was even used or that all votes were counted.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"the-zero-knowledge-solution-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#the-zero-knowledge-solution-3\"></a>The zero knowledge solution</h3>\n<p>Making this process transparent requires both a proof that legitimate votes were counted and that the allocation algorithm was run as intended, whilst keeping <em>the votes themselves private.</em> This is exactly the sort of proof zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography was designed to enable — and why we’re so excited to showcase this project as a hallmark use of the technology.</p>\n<p>There are two places we apply ZKP:</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-1-verifying-the-voting-process-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-1-verifying-the-voting-process-4\"></a>1. Verifying the voting process</h4>\n<p>The first circuit verifies that the cast ballots are legitimate, and that all legitimate ballots are counted. Ballots are legitimate if signed by a badgeholder from the public whitelist.</p>\n<p><strong>The details:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check the ballot signatures against the whitelist.</li>\n<li>For each project, create a hash of all its legitimate ballots. This is denoted as Hash A.</li>\n<li>Aggregate the hashes to generate an overall proof. This proof means that across all projects, all legitimate votes were counted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>This results in Proof A.</strong></p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-2-checking-the-allocation-algorithm-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-2-checking-the-allocation-algorithm-5\"></a>2. Checking the allocation algorithm</h4>\n<p>The second circuit verifies the usage of the allocation algorithm.</p>\n<p>The details:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For each project, we repeat steps 1 and 2 of the first circuit. This, however, is denoted by Hash B. We will check that Hash A = Hash B out of circuit.</li>\n<li>Generate a proof over the allocation algorithm. The algorithm takes in a ballot table as input, and outputs an allocation table. We only need one proof of the whole algorithm.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The results in Proof B.</strong></p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-3-combining-the-proofs-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-3-combining-the-proofs-6\"></a>3. Combining the proofs</h4>\n<p>Since we generate the proofs separately, we want to link them together cryptographically. This ensures there is not tampering of votes in between proofs. We link them by checking that the hashes of legitimate votes, Hash A and Hash B, are the same. This is the same hash you see on the platform, just in QR form.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-4-verifying-a-projects-allocation-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-4-verifying-a-projects-allocation-7\"></a>4. Verifying a project’s allocation</h4>\n<p>This is where you come in! When you press <strong>verify</strong>, you check the allocation was correct for a given project.</p>\n<p>Even though the proofs are for <em>all projects,</em> each proof has a set of public variables particular to a given project. In Proof A this is the hash of the votes (Hash A), in Proof B this is the hash of the votes (Hash B) <em>and</em> the allocation amount for a given project.</p>\n<p>If we change any of those variables, we break verification <em>for a particular project</em>. Try it yourself!</p>\n<h4><a name=\"h-5-verifying-the-entire-retropgf-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#h-5-verifying-the-entire-retropgf-8\"></a>5. Verifying the entire RetroPGF</h4>\n<p>It’s also possible to verify the entire RetroPGF round at once. You can do so by pressing “verify” on the landing page.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"everyones-verification-matters-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#everyones-verification-matters-9\"></a>Everyone’s verification matters</h3>\n<p>If you’re neither a badgeholder nor a recipient, why hit the verify button? Simply put, verifying the results of the round contributes to the security and legitimacy of the process.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s the idea</strong>: Blockchains have both social consensus (which fork is the main one, which client should be run, etc.) and computational consensus. A smart contract can enforce a set of rules, but humans decide which copy of the smart contract is the canonical one. Election workers count ballots, but citizens recognize the result. Similarly, by verifying the RetroPGF results for one or more projects, you help solidify the social consensus around the legitimacy of the vote. You are an election observer, contributing to a successful audit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByUUpr4yR.jpg\" alt=\"photo_2024-03-27_19-22-21\" width=\"690\" height=\"360\"></p>\n<h3><a name=\"implementation-details-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#implementation-details-10\"></a>Implementation details</h3>\n<p>You can find the code for this on our <a href=\"https://blog.ezkl.xyz/post/zkrpgf/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">blog</a>. We briefly discuss the details for verification of the allocation algorithm.</p>\n<p>Optimism’s allocation algorithm was written in Python, which made the EZKL python library a natural fit for in-program conversion of the data science into zero-knowledge proofs. You’ll also notice that OP allocation votes are cast with floating point amounts — this meant a very low tolerance for imprecision.</p>\n<p>EZKL already optimizes heavily for precision given the frequency of nonlinear operations (reciprocals, softmax, etc.) in data science and machine learning models. However, we also made substantial improvements to the core engine, and specifically how we perform lookups, in order to retain proof size while increasing numerical accuracy. Incidentally, proving performance for other models like random forests and transformers improved significantly (sometimes over 90%). A win-win!</p>\n<p>There are a few more important details, specifically around signature verification and the proving system. This may require some background in cryptography, so we omit a full discussion here. However, this also is available on our blog.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#next-steps-11\"></a>Next steps</h3>\n<p>This is just the first step in auditing and automating the Retroactive Funding process. In the future, it is possible to create more comprehensive systems and even automate the process end-to-end. This may look something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Algorithm implemented and formally verified against specifications in governance forums</li>\n<li>Votes checked against whitelist of badgeholders via a proof of legitimacy</li>\n<li>Upon verification, votes run through the allocation algorithm</li>\n<li>Final allocation checked via a proof of calculation</li>\n<li>Upon final verification, distribution of funds automatically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This also makes it easier to reflect and analyze voter behavior without revealing information about any one badgeholder — facilitating incremental improvement for the next round.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"open-questions-call-for-feedback-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#open-questions-call-for-feedback-12\"></a>Open questions &amp; call for feedback</h3>\n<p>We would be grateful for any feedback on the platform, and will aim to implement improvements for future rounds. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Were you more interested in the verification of the whole RetroPGF or focus on particular projects?</li>\n<li>Did you find features like the ability to manipulate the hash or allocation amount interesting? Did they make the meaning of the proof more clear?</li>\n<li>Do you feel comfortable with the implementation, or should we provide further details?</li>\n<li>Are there additional aspects of the voting and allocation process where you would like to see this applied? For example:\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying data analysis on votes/results</li>\n<li>Verifying algorithms to select badgeholders or legitimate voters</li>\n<li>Verifying the weight / inclusion of certain impact metrics</li>\n<li>And any other ideas you may have!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We look forward to feedback and further discussion!</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/proving-the-retropgf-results/7916\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/proving-the-retropgf-results/7916","pubDate":"Wed, 03 Apr 2024 16:46:55 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-7916"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/proving-the-retropgf-results/7916.rss","#text":"Proving the RetroPGF Results"},"filter":false},{"title":"MrCrypto Arabic Delegate Communication Thread","dc:creator":"mrcrypto","category":"Delegate Updates","description":"<p>Hello all!</p>\n<p>We’re thrilled to initiate this dialogue as Delegates within Optimism’s Governance framework.

One area that could be further improved is liquidity management, particularly for assets with interest-bearing features, such as sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>\n<p>sDAI is a synthetic stablecoin that aims to track the price of DAI. However, its price can experience periods of volatility due to factors such as market conditions, changes in the underlying collateral, demand for the asset, and its <strong>interest-bearing</strong> nature. This volatility can make it challenging for liquidity providers to maintain a healthy balance of USDC (or other stablecoins) and sDAI in their pools.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n<p>I propose an automated liquidity management (ALM) system for Velodrome that would use a dynamic range to adjust the ratio of USDC to sDAI in liquidity pools based on the interest rate of sDAI. The range would increase gradually as the price/interest rate of sDAI increases, helping to protect liquidity providers from impermanent loss and capturing the additional yield generated by sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>The proposed ALM system would offer several benefits, including:</p>\n<p>Reduced impermanent loss: The dynamic range would help to reduce impermanent loss for liquidity providers, as it would adjust the pool’s composition to account for changes in the volatility, price, or interest rate of sDAI.</p>\n<p>Increased capital efficiency: The system would allow liquidity providers to make better use of their capital by automatically adjusting the pool’s composition.</p>\n<p>Improved liquidity: The system would help to improve liquidity for sDAI, making it easier for traders to buy and sell the asset.</p>\n<p>Captured yield: The system would allow liquidity providers to capture the additional yield generated by sDAI, increasing their overall returns.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>The ALM system could be implemented using a smart contract that would monitor the price, volatility, and interest rate of sDAI and adjust the pool’s composition accordingly. The smart contract would need to be carefully designed and audited to ensure its security and reliability.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>An automated liquidity management system with an increasing range would be a valuable addition to Velodrome. It would help to reduce impermanent loss for liquidity providers, increase capital efficiency, improve liquidity for sDAI, and allow liquidity providers to capture the additional yield generated by sDAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Details</strong></p>\n<p>The following are some additional details about the proposed ALM system:</p>\n<p>The range would be calculated using a formula that takes into account the price, volatility, interest rate, and other relevant factors of sDAI.</p>\n<p>The range would be updated periodically, such as every hour or every day.</p>\n<p>Liquidity providers would be able to choose whether or not to participate in the ALM system.</p>\n<p>The ALM system would be open source and auditable.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>This proposal is still under development, and I am open to feedback and suggestions.

Yes, the proposed solution addresses the DMR.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible? I believe the proposal is <em>partially</em> feasible. I feel that the most valuable part of this proposal is high-quality open source tooling for creating, operating, and upgrading an OP Stack chain without the need for a RaaS provider. Creating this tooling and making it amazing will set the foundation for a decentralized RaaS in the future. Additionally, there are technical limitations on the protocol that make a truly decentralized RaaS less feasible at the moment. By removing the marketplace aspect of this proposal and doubling down on the high-quality tooling, I believe this work would be much more successful long term.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? Not strictly, see comment above.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team? Unsure.

However, I am concerned that this project would conflict with existing planned work for the fault proof. Other changes like updates to the fault proof required to support Superchain interoperability and support for multiple proof types likely take precedence over this work. Given the security-critical nature of this code path, the proposed changes would likely have to involve engineers from OP Labs whose time would probably consumed by other projects. It is possible that the fault proof protocol changes before this proposal can be accepted into the protocol.<br>\nIt is additionally worth noting that the underlying concern that the proposal is addressing has not been sufficiently analyzed. Although the proposal does increase the cost of censorship, the community currently lacks the research to demonstrate that the censorship risk posed by the current 40-transaction model is unacceptable for Stage 2.<br>\nGiven the above, I would recommend against carrying out this proposal not on technical merits but on strategic ones. I’m mostly worried that the team will spend time on this project and the end result will not be included in the final protocol. Instead, I would encourage the team to submit an alternative proposal that focuses on carrying out the underlying research to demonstrate the censorship risk relative to the number of transactions required as part of the game. Specifically, it would be valuable to understand the exact cost and feasibility of an attacker to execute a censorship attack as the number of transactions required as part of the proof increases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 2:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I am excited to see the proposal. I think that it would be high leverage to work on and it’s completion would really improve the efforts to decentralized the OP stack. The team is strong with a good track record and the proposal is well thought out. I think the collection of individuals who have a strong understanding of the dispute game and fault proofs is small and given me personal expertise i believe this applicant has a strong understanding. I think the requested amount is modest and more than reasonable. I believe that stage two decentralization for for the OP stack and that improvements to the dispute game (currently bisection) should be a priority and I endorse this proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 3:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I am a fan of any kind of meaningful performance improvement, especially if it’s an introduction of new algorithm for the dispute game.

Yes. This moves the OP Stack towards one of its main goals of decentralized fault proving. One could argue that this is less of a research project as it has concrete produce outputs, but it probably fits best of any of the DMRs.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible? Yes, although more research is needed to understand if their prover is fast enough to accomplish the goals.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits? No obvious ones other than the open question of whether their prover is fast enough to support this use case. While they do include some speedups regarding witness generation, it would be nice to see an estimated trace length for proving a block and some estimate of how long it would take to prove said trace based on smaller benchmarks.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team? Yes. This team includes Delphius, who is working on SNARK provers which is the main relevant are of technical expertise required.</li>\n<li>Milestone feedback? Looks good.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 2</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the proposed solution address the DMR?</li>\n<li>Yes, it contributes to technical decentralization by adding another path by which to add redundancy to a critical part of the OP Stack: the fault proof.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible?</li>\n<li>Yes.

I think as superchain vision is realized there will be way more OP Stack L2s that won’t receive support from Etherscan and can’t pay for an integration. And blockscout is generally too much of a departure from normal user flows and that degrades the UX. So going with a Etherscan style UI is great. The team should checkout Otterscan.

They certainly seem to have knowledge of Arweave, and they have released 4EVER-Raas based on OP stack, but something in the write up makes me feel a bit iffy about whether they will succeed at this.</li>\n<li>Milestone feedback?

Yes. They have relevant experience.</li>\n<li>Milestone feedback? Looks ok.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewer 3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the proposed solution address the DMR?</li>\n<li>Yes. It contributes to technical decentralization providing an avenue by how Optimism might become more independent from Ethereum should it need to.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible?</li>\n<li>Yes. DA is about making data available and Arweave’s stated purpose is to store data although I have doubts I will expand in the technical demerits.</li>\n<li>Any technical demerits?</li>\n<li>Optimism seems quite set on being Ethereum aligned. Politics aside using a separate chain whether Arweave or othwerwise may worsen Optimism’s technical decentralization and security by potentially making it reliant on a cheaper but less secure &amp; decentralized DA layer. Furthermore the proposal doesn’t mention a light-client or bridge of any sort that would be required to make proofs that data was made available on Arweave in Ethereum for the sake of fault proofs and disputing sequencers.</li>\n<li>Is this the right team?</li>\n<li>Yes. They’ve built heavily with Arweave in the past.</li>\n<li>Milestone feedback?</li>\n<li>Besides the missing light-client / data-bridge piece mentioned in the demerits the milestones seem well rounded to complete the project.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-cycle-19-intent-1-developer-advisory-board-finalists-review/7899\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-cycle-19-intent-1-developer-advisory-board-finalists-review/7899","pubDate":"Thu, 28 Mar 2024 15:46:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-7899"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-cycle-19-intent-1-developer-advisory-board-finalists-review/7899.rss","#text":"Season 5 Cycle 19 Intent 1 Developer Advisory Board finalists review"},"filter":false},{"title":"Edge City W❤️TA Grant Communication Thread!","dc:creator":"EdgeCity","category":"✨ General","description":"<p>Hey folks!</p>\n<p>Timour from <a href=\"https://www.edgecity.live/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Edge City</a> here.
