Despite these challenges, we received 50 applications and managed to review 100% of them at each milestone. However, only three reviewers had full context for final decision-making due to time constraints. As a result, all non-approved applications were pushed to the next cycle, giving applicants time to incorporate feedback and refine their proposals.</p>\n<p>Cycle 26 Progress: For Cycle 26, we made several improvements to address the issues from the previous cycle:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rubrics and Feedback: Rubric comments are now integrated directly into each application, allowing applicants to view scores and comments for each rubric section. This feature was swiftly implemented by the Charmverse team, and it will significantly enhance the transparency and clarity of the review process.</li>\n<li>Review Process: To improve the decision-making process, we divided the review into two groups of six Grants Council members each. This allowed for a more thorough and balanced evaluation of each application.</li>\n<li>DAB Involvement: The Developer Advisory Board (DAB) played a crucial role in this cycle by providing valuable feedback during the preliminary review. We acknowledge that incorporating their input within 24 hours was a challenge, so we have adjusted our timeline to provide preliminary review lists earlier in the process. Grants Council reviewers had a week to incorporate DAB feedback on each application and edit their scores.</li>\n<li>Application Review: We received 29 new applications in Cycle 26, along with 24 applications carried over from the previous cycle. We maintained a preliminary cutoff at 30 points and set the final cutoff for grantees at 40 points after analyzing two cycles of scores. This new threshold ensures that only applications with strong potential are considered for grants.</li>\n<li>Final Decisions: In Cycle 26, 12 new grants were approved using a top-rank priority and mission request budget limitation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new review process. Applications that did not meet the 40-point threshold have been declined.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Looking Ahead to Cycle 27</strong>: We will continue to refine our processes to ensure that the review and decision-making are as thorough and fair as possible. Submission for Cycle 27 will remain open until Monday, 2nd at 7 pm UTC. We encourage applicants to use the additional feedback provided when re-applying, to strengthen their proposals and aim to meet the 40-point cutoff for consideration as finalists.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd like to extend special congratulations to Derive (formerly Lyra) and Fraxtal for being awarded the first-ever Superchain grants. Their applications have set a high standard for future grant recipients, and we look forward to seeing how they will further strengthen the Superchain ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We extend our thanks to <strong><a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/devtooligan\">@devtooligan</a></strong> for serving as the audit application reviewer from the DAB for this cycle. The audit requests were thoroughly evaluated by 2 members from the Grants Council and 1 member from the DAB. Together, they scored 8 requests and approved 5 of them.</p>\n<p>Below is the list of applications and you can find a detailed database <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13oAA3j_0sXaQOWFXB4CCAqXrXBK_gpqMfsdkyRh98es/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Intent 1</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Cross Chain Voting</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>OP Stack Cross Chain Voting</td>\n<td>Declined</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Cross chain voting with Snapshot and Herodotus</td>\n<td>Asked reduction to acomodate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Aragon &lt;&gt; RISC Zero -

We build dev tools for developers and a user-friend app (app.namespace.tech) for individual ENS name owners, to easily issue Subnames.

This is achieved by utilizing the CCIP protocol, which allows storing ENS subnames and records on L2 chains. The chains are resolved through an offchain gateway application, which verifies the stored data. Furthermore with the introduction of the EVM Gateway by ENS, the data can be stored and verified trustlessly, meaning that the Gateway cannot manipulate the data.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-39712-milestones-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39712-milestones-overview-3\"></a>Milestones overview</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrate CCIP (EVM Gateway) <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></li>\n<li>Deploy Minting and Listing contracts on OP <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\n2.1 Testnet <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\n2.2 Mainnet</li>\n<li>Audit <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></li>\n<li>Write developer documentation for easy integration <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></li>\n<li>Integrate new OP Contracts with the Namespace platform <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/yellow_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":yellow_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":yellow_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> (only testnet)</li>\n<li>Completion, User Testing User adoption + Feedback loop for improvement</li>\n<li>Launch the code and initiate OP expansion</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39712-milestone-1-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39712-milestone-1-4\"></a>Milestone 1</h2>\n<p>The overview of the architecture that outlines the implementation of the CCIP protocol using the EVM Gateway and fault proofs:<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/897460ecdaa2201bb42f7a003e752417abad7b10.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/jBYKInVBwlxtgcyciCOdK5PgpaM.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/897460ecdaa2201bb42f7a003e752417abad7b10_2_690x414.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"jBYKInVBwlxtgcyciCOdK5PgpaM\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"690\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/897460ecdaa2201bb42f7a003e752417abad7b10_2_690x414.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/897460ecdaa2201bb42f7a003e752417abad7b10_2_1035x621.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/897460ecdaa2201bb42f7a003e752417abad7b10_2_1380x828.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F3F5\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>In the CCIP architecture the clients, such as wallets, need to be able to support CCIP, which requires handling the callback response from the resolver contract.

Screening: Gathering of information. Estimated time, up to 5 working days.</strong></p>\n<p>After a case is identified, If the violation is clear and manifest, the council can deliberate without further mapping. If the issue requires to raise more information to make an informed decision, the council will be able to decide if the following week can be a deliberation week, if the case pivots to the mediation provider, if they are ready for voting on the next steps of the case, or if it‚Äôs considered to extend the screening process up to 10 additional working days.</p>\n<p>In the event that a member commits a severe violation and immediate action is required, the COCC will suspend the member from the spaces while the screening process is complete.<br>\nThe COCC will maintain constant contact with the suspended member to maintain a flow of information.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Deliberation: Estimate time, up to 5 working days.</strong></p>\n<p>Once the screening phase is complete, an informed decision is made by consent or by simple vote in the council.

Follow up: 3 month period (half a season)</strong></p>\n<p>Since the CoCC is a persistent structure in Optimism governance starting in season 6, If this follow up period happens between seasons, the previous CoCC members would have to handoff the issues and share the registry of cases to the new council, considering that members may change.</p>\n<p>After the deliberation phase, follow up is where we will review if the proposed actions were effective to deal with the situation, by having accountability on the parties responsibilities.

We believe that a wider range of experts should have a say in which projects deserve to benefit from the economy of giving we‚Äôve built.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year we contemplated whether to allow projects that aren‚Äôt public goods to be able to benefit from GIVpower.  This change would allow projects that are legitimate but not strictly public goods to participate in GIVpower. Effectively this would create two tiers of verification for projects, with each tier having unique requirements and benefits.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39632-enter-devouch-ballot_box_with_check-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39632-enter-devouch-ballot_box_with_check-2\"></a>Enter, DeVouch <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ballot_box_with_check.png?v=12\" title=\":ballot_box_with_check:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":ballot_box_with_check:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h2>\n<p>In June 2024 we launched a new product - <a href=\"https://devouch.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeVouch</a> -  which allows members of reputable organizations to issue attestations for projects looking for funding.

This would be done through the issuance of attestations on Optimism to the eligible addresses.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Giveth Verifiers would be encouraged to participate in an onboarding session to learn the finer points of verifying a project‚Äôs legitimacy and impact and to ensure value alignment with Giveth. Verifiers who completed the onboarding would be issued a separate attestation, signifying they completed the optional onboarding.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the final entity within Verifiers is the Core Reviewers. These are our current core contributors on the Giveth team who review verification applications and issue Verified badges to projects. They will also hold a distinct attestations, highlighting their addresses as the most highly trained Verifiers.</p>\n<p>Giveth Verifiers will be tasked with periodically checking out projects, reviewing their details and issuing vouches for projects that they believe to be legitimate and creating benefit for society and the world. Verifiers may eventually be rewarded in GIV for the reviewing and attesting to projects.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39632-verification-points-coin-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39632-verification-points-coin-5\"></a>Verification Points <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/coin.png?v=12\" title=\":coin:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":coin:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h2>\n<p>Projects that receive vouches from Verifiers will begin to earn Verification Points! Each vouch from a Verifier earns more points for the given project. Anyone will be able to see how many points a project has and which Verifiers vouched for the project.</p>\n<p>With Verifiers classified into three groups, each with their own level of training and experience, we can then adjust the issuance of verification points based on the type of Verifier that vouched for a project. Points earned from Verifiers follow these guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifiers who have NOT completed the onboarding will be worth the least amount of points.</li>\n<li>Verifiers completed the onboarding will add notably more points.</li>\n<li>Core Reviewers will add SIGNIFICANTLY more points than other Verifiers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We‚Äôll have the exact numbers of points closer to when we are ready to launch this feature. At launch we will have the Giveth Verifiers composed of parts of the <strong>Giveth core team and all Optimism Badgeholders from Round 4 &amp; Optimism Super Delegates,  approximately ~260 addresses total.</strong> More Verifiers will be added by Giveth at a later date and we will provide the details of that process when the time is appropriate.</p>\n<p>So, <strong>what the heck are points even all about?</strong></p>\n<p>With Verification Points we can then establish tiers of benefits for projects based on the amount of points they have.

Level 2 projects will be eligible to be boosted with GIVpower AND yield GIVbacks to its donors. Additionally level 2 projects will need to submit an Impact Audit (previously called the Project Verification form). The Impact Audit requires verification of project ownership via social media and asks other important details about the projects goals, organizational structure and clear details on how it will use donations.</p>\n<p>Giveth may add more levels and benefits to existing levels at some point in the future, there is a lot of potential for experimentation!</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39632-impact-audit-face_with_monocle-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39632-impact-audit-face_with_monocle-7\"></a>Impact Audit <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/face_with_monocle.png?v=12\" title=\":face_with_monocle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":face_with_monocle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></h2>\n<p>The Impact Audit is the first thing projects should fill out if they are looking to get vouched for and subsequently earn verification points.</p>\n<p>A redacted version of the audit will be publicly viewable on the project‚Äôs profile.

They create their project on Giveth and are highly encouraged to fill out the Impact Audit (formerly the verification form). Our core team of reviewers will still do the job of reviewing Impact Audits and vouching for projects.</p>\n<p>Project owners however also have the opportunity of getting more points from other Verifiers. Projects  could even reach verification level 1 or 2 without needing a core team member to vouch for it.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39632-giveth-verifiers-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39632-giveth-verifiers-10\"></a>Giveth Verifiers</h2>\n<p>Verifiers will be added to the group by the issuance of attestations and informed via the most appropriate channel (usually TG or Discord). Reviewing project details, including their Impact Audit will be able to be done directly from the project page on Giveth as will vouching for the project. Verifiers will never have to leave the Giveth website in order to participate, however we will also create a channel on TG or Discord as an optional discussion space for Verifiers.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-39632-advice-process-moving-forward-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39632-advice-process-moving-forward-11\"></a>Advice Process &amp; Moving Forward</h1>\n<p>The proposed changes will significantly enhance the transparency, legitimacy, and overall effectiveness of the Giveth verification process. By decentralizing the verification system and introducing tiered levels of verification, we aim to leverage the collective knowledge and expertise of the ecosystem to ensure that high-quality and value-aligned projects benefit from our GIVeconomy.</p>\n<p>This is an invitation for Optimism Governance stakeholders to <strong>share their thoughts, suggestions, and concerns</strong>.

However, many limitations were identified, leading to significant changes in Season 6 and beyond. Feedback from Grants Council members and builders revealed that Trust Tiers were not accurately reflecting team reputations, were hard to verify, and were not effective in predicting success in completing grants. To address these issues, a new reputation model, bottom-up based on trust signals, will be developed, moving away from the current Trust Tiers system in Season 6. Instead, the focus will be on gathering and recording attestations about projects to enable data-driven decision-making. This shift aims to improve grant decisions by leveraging more reliable trust signals and ensuring better outcomes for completed grants.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39608-optimism-fractal-season-4httpsgovoptimismiotoptimism-fractal-season-48707-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39608-optimism-fractal-season-4httpsgovoptimismiotoptimism-fractal-season-48707-3\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-fractal-season-4/8707\">Optimism Fractal Season 4</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-08-12</p>\n<p><strong>Author</strong>: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/dansingjoy\">@DanSingjoy</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Optimism Fractal is welcoming everyone back for Season 4 after their summer break.

For example, in <a href=\"https://round3.optimism.io/\">Retro Funding 3</a>‚Ä¶</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://round3.optimism.io/projects/0x09a432ebeb70fe4d205e410b028c0ac46b04aa9e1e96b9fafdeb8dc06dbb22e0\">Test-in-Prod</a> applied with 5 distinct projects, ranging from work on OP Stack client implementations to data analytics work.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://round3.optimism.io/projects/0xf780b4a39ea9529b9e7af1638c816801ce89cf06e93dd6d66ea383fb3ed263f0\">Department of Decentralization</a> applied both with their work on conferences and hackathons, such as ETHBerlin and Protocol Berg, as well their work on the Goerli Testnetwork.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This mixture of substantially different projects in a single application adds difficulty to the voting process. It makes comparisons among applications harder and increases the complexity of voting.</p>\n<p><strong>Organizations aim to solve this problem.</strong></p>\n<p>An organization is a new entity within OP Atlas that reflects a company, DAO or team which is working together. Each organization can create one or multiple projects that reflect distinct products, services, or contributions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Organization</strong>: Team, DAO, or business working together on one or multiple projects</li>\n<li><strong>Project:</strong> A distinct product, service, or contribution that reflects a significant amount of work</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>What should not be a project:</strong> Individual activities within a larger project, such as a commit, a contract deployment on a new chain, a single call or presentation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With Organizations, Test-in-Prod can represent itself as a team, and then create distinct projects with which they want to apply to Retro Funding. Each project will then be judged separately within the relevant retro round.</p>\n<p>While in some cases creating an organization is helpful, projects do not need to be associated to an organization. For example, individuals building things by themselves can simply create a project and submit it for Retro Funding consideration. Groups of people who worked together on a single project, for example as part of a hackathon, may also choose not to create an organization. Creating the right framework for organizations and projects remains a challenge that we‚Äôll continue to iterate on, and we appreciate your feedback.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39509-application-questions-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39509-application-questions-2\"></a>Application Questions</h3>\n<p>As a continuation of the involvement of badgeholders in the design process of Retro Funding rounds, the Foundation <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/board/qcwy2ix4avwjMtSwBqU9Ef/R5%3A-Application-Jam?node-id=20-402&amp;t=50ys6oRpAiZskgnr-1\">hosted a workshop</a> with the aim of refining the project application form to collect more insightful information for the Retro Funding 5 voting process. The workshop provided valuable insights into the kinds of questions and answers that will help badgeholders better evaluate projects impact across the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-op-stack-round-details/8612\">three scope categories</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Workshop Outcomes:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Refined Questions for Impact Evaluation:</strong> Through group discussions, we identified key questions that should be included in the project application form to help badgeholders assess impact more effectively. For instance, we determined that for Ethereum Core Contributions, it‚Äôs crucial to ask questions that clarify how a project supports or is a dependency of the OP Stack. Important feedback has been the desire to have more verifiable information about projects impact, instead of self-reported statements,  user testimonials were  highlighted as anexample of this.</li>\n<li><strong>Targeted Asks:</strong> The workshop also shed light on the nature of the data submitted for the different categories through an exercise of evaluating the answers received in Retro Funding 3. A more focused set of questions, anchored in tangible, specific impact related proof were brought forward to avoid broad, or at times unrelated, information being submitted by projects.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We collated the most effective questions that emerged from each group discussion per category and sent out a survey to the broader badgeholder set to gather additional feedback and enable broader voting and calibration of these questions. The aim of the workshop &amp; survey is to make the application process better aligned with the needs and expectations of badgeholders, ultimately leading to more accurate rewarding of impact in Retro Funding 5.</p>\n<p>Below are the final application questions which were selected as a result of the workstream:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ethereum Core Contributions</strong>: How does your project support, or is a dependency of, the OP Stack? How would it impact the OP Stack if your project ceased to exist?</li>\n<li><strong>OP Stack Research &amp; Development</strong>: How has your project advanced the development of the OP Stack? Who has benefited the most from your work on the OP Stack and how?</li>\n<li><strong>OP Stack Tooling</strong>: How has the infrastructure you built enabled the testing, deployment, and operation of OP chains? Who has used your tooling and how has it benefited them (Please reference relevant data sources which surface the impact of your tooling, such as user surveys, testimonials, attestations etc)?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39509-other-updates-changes-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39509-other-updates-changes-3\"></a><strong>Other Updates &amp; Changes</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Project grant and funding reporting</strong>: See <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-grants-funding-within-the-application-process/8742\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Retro Funding 5: Grants &amp; Funding within the application process</a> post for more details.</li>\n<li><strong>Add Links</strong>:  Applicants can now add links to their projects. They can add any link which supports them in showcasing their impact.

This dynamic creates an incentive for projects to not disclose grants, funding and revenue.</li>\n<li><strong>Attributing Optimism Grants</strong>: Optimism issues a number of different types of grants (Token House missions, Foundation missions, and Partner Fund grants). A grant might be received for a variety of purposes with distinct grant conditions. Participants in the deliberative process have highlighted the complexity when considering these many different grant types, a prime example has been the distinction between Token House Builder grants and Growth grants.</li>\n<li><strong>Attributing Profit to Impact:</strong> A project might receive grants and funding for different services or products benefitting different types of users, companies and ecosystems. To implement impact = profit, Retro Funding needs to attribute what forms of grants and funding relate to the impact that is rewarded in the relevant retro round. This attribution poses a complex challenge, as it requires an understanding of the purpose of different grants and funding that were received.</li>\n<li><strong>Attribution of Funding and Revenue:</strong> The structuring of legal entities can have a significant effect on how revenue, grants and funding are attributed to projects. Some companies may pursue a structure where the development of different products (closed and open source) takes place within separate legal entities, while others combine open and closed source work within a single entity. Projects which combine open and closed source work within a single entity might be worse off, as all their funding and revenue is considered, while projects with separate entities benefit.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39508-retro-funding-5-information-collection-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39508-retro-funding-5-information-collection-2\"></a>Retro Funding 5: Information Collection</h2>\n<p>For Retro Funding 5, the application process will provide badgeholders with relevant information relating to grants and funding, based on feedback from the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-deliberative-process-on-the-definition-of-profit/8083\">deliberative process experiment</a> and <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA\">previous retro rounds</a>. In Round 5, the voter exit survey will aim to measure the importance of this information to voters, to understand the value this information provides in the voting process to inform future application processes.</p>\n<p>The following information will be collected from projects</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Projects are required to report if their product/service is free, freemium or pay-to-use. If one of latter two categories is selected, the project is asked to report the pricing model for their product/service. This information is aiming to give voters insights into the business model of a project and its value extraction. The application review process will rely on publicly available information to enforce the accurate reporting of this information. The correct reporting of non-public information can‚Äôt be enforced.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimism Grants:</strong> Due to the verifiability of Optimism grants, projects are required to report grants which they received from the Token House, Citizens‚Äô House or Optimism Foundation since January 2023. This includes Token House Missions, Foundation Missions and Retro Funding rewards.</li>\n<li><strong>Investments</strong>: Projects are required to report funding which they received in exchange for equity since January 2020. They reporting is done by selecting between ranges of funding (Less than $1M, $1M-$5M, $5M-$10M, $10M-$25M, $25M-$50M, more than $50M). The application review process will rely on publicly available information to verify the accurate reporting of this information. The correct reporting of non-public information can‚Äôt be verified, this poses a significant risk of including funding in the definition of profit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following information will not be collected from projects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Other Grants</strong>: Information on non-Optimism grants will not be collected due to its non-verifiable nature combined with the results of <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/ratification-of-profit-definition-for-round-4/8312#vote-1-6\">the deliberative process on profit</a>, in which 74% of participants voted to not consider ‚ÄúOther Grants‚Äù in Retro Funding.</li>\n<li><strong>Revenue ‚Üí Replaced by Pricing</strong>: Information on non-Optimism grants will not be collected due to its non-verifiable nature combined with the results of <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/ratification-of-profit-definition-for-round-4/8312#vote-1-6\">the deliberative process on profit</a>, in which 80% of participants voted to not consider ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù in Retro Funding. Instead the application process is collecting information on pricing to provide insights into the value extraction of a project (see above).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39508-risks-and-drawbacks-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39508-risks-and-drawbacks-3\"></a>Risks and Drawbacks</h3>\n<p>Badgeholders should be aware of the risks and drawbacks introduced by the current state of defining impact = profit. A key goal of Retro Funding is to sustainably reward Optimism core contributors for the impact they provide to the Collective. Key to achieving this goal is creating reliability for projects when it comes to Retro Funding rewards, so that they can contribute to Optimism knowing that they will be rewarded for their impact.<br>\nThe current state of defining profit, <strong>poses a significant challenge to achieving reliability.</strong> It creates high uncertainty for projects, as they are not able to understand how grants and funding may impact their Retro Funding rewards.</p>\n<p>Further, the current design leads to inconsistency on how grants and funding are taken into account within impact evaluation. Each badgeholder may apply a different definition of profit across projects. This results in a system in which the grants and funding of two identical projects may have vastly different effects on their Retro Funding rewards.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of Governance minimisation, <strong>Retro Funding should strive to use a minimal set of rules required to reward impact.</strong> This is a core principal of Optimism Governance because each additional rule adds high costs to the system by requiring more bureaucracy to support its enforcement, increasing the surface area for attack and overall complexity and rigidity of the system.</p>\n<p>We appreciate the many discussions badgeholders have had on the topic of profit over the past four rounds. We‚Äôve used insights and outputs from the deliberative process to make incremental progress towards this definition in Round 5. It will continue to be an iterative and gradual process to define the goals and implementation of profit as it pertains to impact evaluation.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-grants-funding-within-the-application-process/8742\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-grants-funding-within-the-application-process/8742","pubDate":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 11:53:21 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8742"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-grants-funding-within-the-application-process/8742.rss","#text":"Retro Funding 5: Grants & Funding within the application process"},"filter":false},{"title":"Tingchain: The First Optimism Deployment on a Non-Ethereum Chain (TON)","dc:creator":"TingChain","category":"‚ú® General","description":"<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>\nThe TON Application Chain (TAC) is an innovative Layer-2 blockchain designed to enhance the functionality, interoperability, and scalability of the TON (The Open Network) ecosystem by enabling seamless integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible protocols. This development significantly expands the scope of the TON ecosystem, allowing it to support a wide range of decentralized applications (DApps) operating within the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond.</p>\n<p>Tingchain, a groundbreaking Layer 2 solution designed for the TON ecosystem, marks the first Optimism deployment on a non-Ethereum chain. Tingchain aims to revolutionize the TON network by providing scalability, enhancing liquidity, and ensuring EVM compatibility, thus extending the reach of the Optimism ecosystem into new and untapped territories.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation</strong><br>\nThe TON ecosystem has demonstrated rapid growth, with a significant Total Value Locked (TVL) and an increasing user base. However, the lack of EVM compatibility has limited its potential, constraining developers‚Äô and users‚Äô ability to fully leverage existing DeFi resources and dApps. The deployment of Tingchain as an Optimism Layer 2 chain addresses this gap, bringing Ethereum-compatible assets and advanced scaling solutions to the TON network.</p>\n<p><strong>Tingchain Initiative Details</strong><br>\n<strong>Overview</strong><br>\nTingchain is designed as a Layer 2 solution focused on scalability and liquidity, seamlessly integrating with the TON ecosystem while maintaining EVM compatibility. This initiative addresses several key challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling for TON: Tingchain enhances transaction throughput on TON by leveraging Optimism technology, reducing latency and fees, and making DeFi and dApp operations more efficient.</li>\n<li>Liquidity Bridge: Tingchain acts as a bridge for Ethereum-based assets, including ETH and stablecoins, into the TON ecosystem, significantly boosting available liquidity and enabling a richer DeFi environment.</li>\n<li>Developer Tools: Tingchain provides comprehensive developer tools to build, optimize, and deploy scalable applications on TON, driving widespread adoption through easy integration with existing Ethereum-based applications.</li>\n<li>Expanding the Optimism Ecosystem: By deploying on TON, Tingchain introduces the first Optimism Layer 2 on a non-Ethereum chain, tapping into TON‚Äôs vast user base, particularly within the Telegram ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Target Market</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developers: Game and dApp developers on TON seeking scalable and EVM-compatible solutions will find Tingchain‚Äôs offerings particularly appealing.</li>\n<li>Users: Gamers and dApp users within TON will benefit from reduced transaction costs, faster processing times, and a broader range of DeFi services.</li>\n<li>Related Projects: DeFi protocols and other blockchain projects looking for robust interoperability and enhanced liquidity will be drawn to Tingchain‚Äôs capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Impact</strong><br>\nThe deployment of Tingchain as an Optimism Layer 2 on TON is expected to have a significant impact on both the TON and Optimism ecosystems. It will introduce additional liquidity, enhance user engagement, and provide exposure to a new, actively engaged user base. This initiative is expected to increase TVL, drive user participation, and generate additional revenue streams. Additionally, a portion of Tingchain‚Äôs profits will be allocated to the ongoing development and support of Optimism, ensuring the sustainability of this collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong><br>\nThe deployment of Tingchain leverages the robust architecture of Optimism‚Äôs Layer 2 technology, providing a secure and scalable solution for TON. This strategic move is designed to attract both DeFi and GameFi users from the TON ecosystem, backed by the experience and expertise of the Tingchain development team. This deployment not only enhances the TON network but also extends Optimism‚Äôs reach and influence beyond Ethereum.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Plan</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>September: Begin internal testing and deployment on Testnet.</li>\n<li>October: Launch Tingchain on Mainnet, officially expanding the Optimism ecosystem to TON.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>\nTingchain is poised to pioneer the integration of Optimism technology in a non-Ethereum environment, starting with TON. This initiative not only enhances the capabilities of the TON ecosystem but also broadens the horizon for Optimism, creating new opportunities for growth, collaboration, and innovation within the broader blockchain community.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow us at:</strong> <a href=\"http://linktr.ee/tingchain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">http://linktr.ee/tingchain</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/tingchain-the-first-optimism-deployment-on-a-non-ethereum-chain-ton/8740\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/tingchain-the-first-optimism-deployment-on-a-non-ethereum-chain-ton/8740","pubDate":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 05:28:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8740"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/tingchain-the-first-optimism-deployment-on-a-non-ethereum-chain-ton/8740.rss","#text":"Tingchain: The First Optimism Deployment on a Non-Ethereum Chain (TON)"},"filter":false},{"title":"Upgrade Proposal #10: Granite Network Upgrade","dc:creator":"inphi","category":"Protocol Upgrade","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-39463-executive-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39463-executive-summary-1\"></a>Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>Hi I‚Äôm Mofi, a protocol engineer at OP Labs. OP Labs is a software development company focused on the Optimism ecosystem and a core developer of the OP Stack. We provide some services to, but do not represent or speak on behalf of, the Optimism Foundation.</p>\n<p>This upgrade is proposed in response to security vulnerabilities identified during a series of third-party security audits by Spearbit, Cantina, and Code4rena. None of the vulnerabilities have been exploited, and user assets are not and were never at risk. However, out of an abundance of caution, the permissioned fallback mechanism has been activated in order to avoid any potential instability while the vulnerabilities are patched. For more information on the permissioned fallback mechanism and the OP Stack‚Äôs defense-in-depth approach to Fault Proof security, see the <a href=\"https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/fault-proofs/fp-security\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>The upgrade includes both a set of smart contract upgrades to fix the vulnerabilities identified in the audit as well as an L2 hardfork to improve the stability and performance of the fault proof system. In addition, we propose extending the capabilities of the Guardian and DeputyGuardian to set the anchor state for the fault proof system in order to prevent referencing invalid anchor states. Aside from implementing these fixes, the primary impact of this upgrade would be to reset user withdrawals at the planned time, similar to the initial Fault Proof upgrade.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-39463-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39463-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>As described in the original upgrade <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-protocol-upgrade-7-fault-proofs/8161\">proposal</a>, our rollout strategy for Fault Proofs focuses on securing the fundamental security mechanisms first, then building confidence on the correctness of the rest of the system over time. Successfully performing this strategy requires that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The fallback mechanisms are activated whenever there is a risk of a security vulnerability.</li>\n<li>Any vulnerabilities that may arise are swiftly patched.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore, the Foundation (via the Deputy Guardian role) activated the permissioned fallback which restricts output proposals to a trusted proposer and we at OP Labs created this proposal to resolve the vulnerabilities identified by the security audits. Note that the Guardian role is generally authorized to enforce ‚ÄúSafety over Liveness‚Äù in the system, meaning that it can pause and unpause withdrawals and as part of the Fault Proofs upgrade was authorized to intervene in the event that a bug would allow an invalid L2 output to be finalized.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-39463-specifications-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39463-specifications-3\"></a>Specifications</h1>\n<p>The specification for the proposed changes can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">specs repo</a>.

Issue severities have been updated to match the <a href=\"https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/optimism/information/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Optimism ImmuneFi bounty</a>. While the auditors did discover some high severity issues, no user assets were ever at risk. All of the audit issues listed below can be detected by our monitoring tooling. Had an exploit been detected, the Deputy Guardian role - which is held by the Optimism Foundation and revocable by the Security Council - would have been expected to blacklist any exploitable dispute games or activate the permissioned fallback.</p>\n<p>Note that we have updated the spec to clarify some assumptions around the Cannon VM and program. Specifically, we trust that the Go compiler will emit proper MIPS32 programs. As a result, the Cantina issues that reference problems related to invalid MIPS32 programs are considered out-of-scope and will not be fixed.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, vulnerabilities in the dispute game all occur at MAX_GAME_DEPTH and are therefore classified as medium.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Issue ID</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Severity</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Summary</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Cantina 3.1.1: Allocation overflow could allow for arbitrary code execution</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">High</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Mmap calls did not perform memory bounds checking, which allowed memory pointers to wrap around to zero and access the entire memory of the fault proof program including the data and text sections of active MIPS programs. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the VM, effectively breaking the VM‚Äôs correctness guarantees. No PoC was given, and it is our belief that such an exploit is infeasible due to memory protections employed by the Go runtime.

If there is enough gas left in the loadPrecompilePart function, a valid preimage could be overwritten with the outOfGas error itself. This would result in an incorrect game outcome.</p>\n<p>The function of the loadPrecompilePreimagePart method is to allow certain expensive precompiles - namely ecrecover, ecpairing, and kzg_point_evaluation - to be accelerated. Accelerated precompiles offload their execution to an L1 oracle. Since precompiles are implemented natively rather than via EVM opcodes, this improves Cannon‚Äôs performance and allows challengers to quickly generate traces for blocks filled with these computationally expensive calls. To address the outOfGas issue, we‚Äôre adding a minimum gas requirement to the PreimageOracle to ensure there‚Äôs enough gas to accelerate precompiles on L1.</p>\n<p>Another related issue with loadPrecompilePreimagePart is that the gas required to accelerate precompiles on L1 may be insufficient given the cost of executing them on L2. This is because the gas provided to the precompile accelerator contract on L1 can never exceed 63/64th of the gas limit on L2. This is a problem for precompiles that have a dynamic gas cost of execution. Of the accelerated precompiles, ecPairing is the only one that contains this vulnerability as its gas cost scales with its input size.</p>\n<p>To fix this problem, we are proposing an L2 hardfork to limit the maximum input size provided to the ecPairing precompile to 112687 bytes. This number is high enough to enable all known use cases of the ecPairing precompile, but low enough to enable the challenger to generate traces for larger blocks in a timely manner. While this is technically a divergence from the EVM, our on-chain data has found no calls to the ecPairing precompile with an input size over 1187 bytes. The provided limit is therefore 2 orders of magnitude larger than any known use case, which we believe is sufficiently safe.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39463-additional-fixes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39463-additional-fixes-7\"></a>Additional Fixes</h2>\n<p>In addition to the audit fixes above, we are also proposing the following additional fixes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We propose reducing the ChannelTimeout value from 200 blocks to 50. Canon has a limited amount of memory - approximately 1.1GB - and is not currently garbage collected. The longer channel timeout caused Cannon to run out of memory on OP Sepolia, and was close to the limit on mainnet. Reducing the ChannelTimeout significantly increases the amount of memory available to Cannon and reduces the risk of an OOM occurring.</li>\n<li>An ImmuneFi bounty hunter noticed that DelayedWETH‚Äôs recover function is not robust against transfers which need more than 2300 gas.

No vulnerabilities were found in the fallback mechanisms, which were themselves <a href=\"https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/205/report\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">audited</a> prior to deploying Fault Proofs in June.</p>\n<p>As per the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/op-labs-audit-framework-when-to-get-external-security-review-and-how-to-prepare-for-it/6864\">Audit Framework</a>, the dispute game and MIPS contracts fall into the liveness/reputational risk category which do not require audits. The fallback mechanisms make any bugs simple to recover from and  pose no risk to user funds. Therefore, we have opted not to pursue a fix review for the changes made in this proposal. We propose addressing any additional issues discovered in a similar manner to the way they are being addressed here, specifically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Depending on the issues at hand, Labs recommend that the Deputy Guardian trigger the fallback or blacklist specific dispute games.</li>\n<li>Labs or (others in the core developer community) would create a governance proposal to resolve the issues.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There‚Äôs quite a bit of nuance to when the fallbacks should be activated. In light of this audit, we propose adopting the following rubric to decide if/when the fallback should be activated. If an issue is costly to exploit - e.g., it requires playing the game to MAX_GAME_DETH - then we propose disclosing it immediately and using the dispute game blacklist to mitigate any attempts to exploit it. The dispute game blacklist will seize any bonds paid by an attacker, and makes attempting to exploit dispute resolution deeply unprofitable. On the other hand, if issues are not costly to exploit then we propose activating the fallback prior to disclosure. In both cases, fixes for the vulnerabilities would be proposed as a regular protocol upgrade in the nearest voting cycle.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/op-labs-audit-framework-when-to-get-external-security-review-and-how-to-prepare-for-it/6864\">OP Labs Audit Framework</a>, we have not had the contents of the hardfork audited. However, OP Labs did perform a security review of these changes. Risk analysis of each L2 change is below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limiting the size of ecPairing‚Äôs input is considered a <strong>low-risk</strong> change. Implementation bugs would not put user assets at risk. Even though this is technically a divergence from the EVM, our data suggests that there have been no usages of the ecPairing precompile with an input size &gt; 1152 bytes, which is far below the limit we will be imposing.</li>\n<li>Reducing the ChannelTimeout is considered a <strong>low-risk</strong> change. Implementation bugs would not put user assets at risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-39463-impact-summary-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39463-impact-summary-10\"></a>Impact Summary</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>OP Labs does not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade.</li>\n<li>If this proposal is approved, node operators <strong>must</strong> upgrade their node software prior to September 11th in order to avoid a chain split.</li>\n<li>As a result of triggering the fallback, <strong>all pending withdrawals will be invalidated</strong>.

The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked-in activation time. Granite is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit a81de910dc2fd9b2f67ee946466f2de70d62611a and op-geth at commit 0f5b9dcfd2ac66f6fd8faae526b1549721f5f392. The smart contracts release is op-contracts/v1.6.0-rc.1. The op-node and op-geth releases will be finalized if this proposal passes.</p>\n<p>This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets and the Sepolia Superchain in coordination with Base and Conduit.</p>\n<p>The overall upgrade plan is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Update the Absolute Pre-State:</strong> Prior to the hardfork activation, we will update the absolute pre-state as done in the Fjord upgrade. This ensures that the new op-program can be used with the upgraded protocol, and must be performed prior to hardfork activation. See the Fjord upgrade <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-9-fjord-network-upgrade/8236\">proposal</a> for more details. This upgrade is transparent to users, and no action is required.</li>\n<li><strong>Activate the Hardfork on L2:</strong> The hardfork will activate on the L2 network at the scheduled time. Node operators must upgrade to the versions described above to avoid a chain split. Once upgraded, no further action is required.</li>\n<li><strong>Update the L1 Smart Contracts:</strong> Finally, we will update the L1 smart contracts to new versions that contain fixes for the audit issues. This upgrade is transparent to users, and no action is required. This update will also deactivate the fallback mechanism, and revert back to permissionless proposing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Security Council and Optimism Foundation must sign the transactions for steps 1 and 3 prior to the hardfork activation. This sequence is crucial to prevent breaking the fault proof system.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39463-emergency-cancellation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39463-emergency-cancellation-12\"></a>Emergency Cancellation</h2>\n<p>The releases above will contain a Granite activation at the above-mentioned time. If a critical security issue is found between approval and rollout, the Optimism Foundation and Security Council should coordinate an emergency cancellation. Node operators can quickly react by using the --override.granite flag on both op-node and op-geth.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-39463-conclusion-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39463-conclusion-13\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>This proposal outlines the Granite network upgrade, which responds to security vulnerabilities identified by third-party auditors.

Guesswork and informed opinions play a part in the formation of hypotheses, but diverging opinions are settled through hypothesis-testing. This process ensures that as Citizen selection evolves over time, it is always evolving in the direction of progress towards the objectives. Changes that have an undesirable effect are rolled back, and mistakes are learned from to inform future improvements.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: <em>The types of experiments run in the name of Citizen selection are unlikely to be double-blind controlled trials. We seek to use the principles and practices of experimentation to the maximum extent feasible, with the aim of growing the amount of high-confidence knowledge about Citizen selection that the Collective has access to.</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39451-experimentation-on-citizen-selection-in-practice-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39451-experimentation-on-citizen-selection-in-practice-2\"></a>Experimentation on Citizen selection in practice</h2>\n<p>Effective experimentation with Citizen selection has several prerequisites:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ability to measure both input and outcome variables</li>\n<li>Short feedback cycles</li>\n<li>Reversibility</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39451-measuring-both-input-and-outcome-variables-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39451-measuring-both-input-and-outcome-variables-3\"></a>Measuring both input and outcome variables</h3>\n<p>To run effective experiments, the inputs and outcomes of those experiments must be measurable. Inputs (independent variables) are the aspects of Citizen selection that we want to change or influence, and outcomes (dependent variables) are the measurable effects of the experiment, usually tied to the overall objective we want to achieve. A large effort is underway to improve our ability to measure key aspects of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding), Citizens‚Äô House performance and other aspects of the Citizenry.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39451-short-feedback-cycles-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39451-short-feedback-cycles-4\"></a>Short feedback cycles</h3>\n<p>Effective experimentation often involves testing many different variables in different conditions. In order to make efficient progress, we need to be able to run a lot of experiments and learn from them quickly. Increasing the number of Retro Funding iterations per year and introducing new opportunities for experiments can allow us to shorten feedback cycles.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39451-reversibility-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39451-reversibility-5\"></a>Reversibility</h3>\n<p>The primary objective of experimentation is to learn. Experiments are a risk - we are never sure what the outcome will be, otherwise there would be no need for an experiment. Any changes made to Citizen selection in the name of experimentation must therefore be reversible. The concept of guest voters in Retro Funding experiments is one way to ensure reversibility of experiments.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-39451-citizen-selection-experiments-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39451-citizen-selection-experiments-6\"></a>Citizen selection experiments</h3>\n<p>The purpose of experimentation with Citizen selection is to increase the Collective‚Äôs knowledge about the effectiveness of various different selection mechanisms to ultimately enable effective future decisions. Experiments are currently run as part of the planned Retro Funding iterations that happen multiple times per year, with experiment outcomes being shared publicly at the end of each experiment.</p>\n<p>For each Retro Funding iteration, a different selection mechanism may be tested by selecting a limited number of guest voters to participate in the round. Guest voters are temporary participants in Retro Funding votes, and should not be confused with Citizens who participate in protocol upgrade proposal vetoes in addition to Retro Funding votes. The purpose of introducing guest voters is to increase the reversibility of experiments.</p>\n<p>Increased data collection around Retro Funding votes and their participants is also an essential component of measuring experiment outcomes, and may take several forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Surveys distributed to voters, builders and other stakeholders</li>\n<li>An analysis of voting behavior within and across Retro Funding votes</li>\n<li>Measuring the concentration of power through social graph analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another essential type of data required for experimentation with Citizen selection is identity and ‚Äòreputation‚Äô data. This forms an important input into selection mechanisms themselves and is therefore essential to the Collective‚Äôs ability to experiment with various approaches.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39451-identity-reputation-and-citizen-selection-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39451-identity-reputation-and-citizen-selection-7\"></a>Identity, reputation and Citizen selection</h2>\n<p>There are a myriad of variations of the above approaches to Citizen selection that may be tested experimentally. Many such selection mechanisms rely on information about prospective Citizens to make selection decisions. Building a rich identity layer within the Collective allows these kinds of selection mechanisms to function.</p>\n<p>By enabling individual members of the Collective to build and maintain their identity as a Collective participant, potentially relevant information about the individual can be factored into the selection process. For example, some selection mechanisms may use someone‚Äôs professional contributions to the Collective as a deciding factor in whether they should be Citizens. Another might use the duration and depth of engagement with apps built on the Superchain. These are just hypothetical examples, but they illustrate the importance of individual identity in being able to test all selection mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Building out <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/aVobj2ZKRoGZo5hKbvneiA\">the identity stack(opens in a new tab)</a> ensures that the Optimism Collective is able to effectively experiment with all possible selection mechanisms to identify those with the best performance. It is therefore a core building block in the development of Citizenship. Without adequate data on potential candidate Citizens and the performance of the Citizenry on its objectives, it is impossible to experiment with selection criteria.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39451-to-recap-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39451-to-recap-8\"></a>To recap</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A solid and shared foundation of knowledge and data from open-sourced experiments is essential for the Collective‚Äôs decision-making ability.</li>\n<li>Experimentation with selection criteria is the most effective way to increase knowledge around the effectiveness of various approaches to Citizen selection.</li>\n<li>Measurement of inputs and outcomes of Citizen selection, short feedback loops and reversible changes are essential prerequisites for the Collective to build up a reliable process for experimentation.</li>\n<li>The Optimism Foundation currently runs experiments on Citizen selection using guest voters in Retro Funding iterations with the help of surveys, voting analysis and other methods to measure experiment outcomes.</li>\n</ul>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/cross-posting-experimentation-with-citizenship/8732\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/cross-posting-experimentation-with-citizenship/8732","pubDate":"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 14:01:12 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8732"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/cross-posting-experimentation-with-citizenship/8732.rss","#text":"Cross Posting - Experimentation with Citizenship"},"filter":false},{"title":"Quadratic Funding + Retro: Token Engineering the Superchain!","dc:creator":"jade","category":"‚ú® General","description":"<h1><a name=\"p-39450-help-test-a-new-type-of-gitcoin-round-that-boosts-the-votes-of-superchain-stakeholders-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39450-help-test-a-new-type-of-gitcoin-round-that-boosts-the-votes-of-superchain-stakeholders-1\"></a>Help test a new type of Gitcoin round that boosts the votes of Superchain stakeholders!</h1>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><strong><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/8/864891ff0e691aabd42206cf8aae36103ca509fa.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/j9VsEE3aRrLCfalPkq81hW1NcMy.png?dl=1\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/864891ff0e691aabd42206cf8aae36103ca509fa_2_624x124.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"j9VsEE3aRrLCfalPkq81hW1NcMy\" width=\"624\" height=\"124\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/864891ff0e691aabd42206cf8aae36103ca509fa_2_624x124.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/864891ff0e691aabd42206cf8aae36103ca509fa_2_936x186.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/8/864891ff0e691aabd42206cf8aae36103ca509fa_2_1248x248.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"D6465A\"></a></strong></div><p></p>\n<p>Token Engineering the Superchain is attracting token engineering practitioners and projects to the Superchain ‚Äì and it‚Äôs <a href=\"https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/57\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">now live on Gitcoin</a>!

If you discover a possible conflict later on, you‚Äôre required to contact a Lead Reviewer to be removed from reviewing this project. A conflict of Interest is defined as ‚ÄúOrganizations where you expect any portion of funds to flow to yourself or any projects from which you derive income‚Äù.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39448-reviewer-selection-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39448-reviewer-selection-2\"></a>Reviewer Selection</h2>\n<p>Citizens will be selected as Reviewers via a combination of an opt-in process and random sampling. This allows for a smaller group to engage in the process, while still being fairly selected via random sampling.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Opt-in</strong>: Citizens can opt-in to participate in the application review process until Aug 31st 19:00 UTC. To opt-in please fill out <a href=\"https://deform.optimism.io/reviewer-sign-ups\">this form</a> (<a href=\"https://deform.optimism.io/reviewer-sign-ups\">https://deform.optimism.io/reviewer-sign-ups</a>) and be sure you have read the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-application-review-process/8730#p-39448-reviewer-expectations-1\">Reviewer Expectations</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Random Sampling</strong>: 30 reviewers will be randomly selected from the citizens who have opted-in to review. Selection will take place on September 2nd and citizens will be notified via email about the outcome of the random selection.</li>\n<li><strong>Lead Reviewers</strong>: Diego, the Citizens‚Äô House Gov NERD, will act as a non-voting lead reviewer, responsible for resolving questions, collecting votes, managing the timeline of the process and facilitating collaboration. One additional non-voting lead reviewer will be selected by Diego to manage and facilitate the process during European working hours. You can add your application to be a lead reviewer in the sign up form.</li>\n<li><strong>Reviewer Groups:</strong> Instead of randomly assigning reviewers to cases, there will be 6 reviewer groups with 5 reviewers each. Each reviewer will be randomly assigned to a group. This design aims at reducing the operational and technical complexity, as well as allow for more collaboration among reviewers.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a name=\"p-39448-application-review-process-overview-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#p-39448-application-review-process-overview-3\"></a>Application Review Process Overview</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b7dabd3eace0df362d8a93338859d22a3b43de4d.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qes1thEWhW75PywPjkcI9DOhXuB.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b7dabd3eace0df362d8a93338859d22a3b43de4d_2_690x292.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"qes1thEWhW75PywPjkcI9DOhXuB\" width=\"690\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b7dabd3eace0df362d8a93338859d22a3b43de4d_2_690x292.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b7dabd3eace0df362d8a93338859d22a3b43de4d_2_1035x438.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b7dabd3eace0df362d8a93338859d22a3b43de4d_2_1380x584.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FCFCFB\"></a></div><p></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Application is submitted</strong> via <a href=\"http://retrofunding.optimism.io\">retrofunding.optimism.io</a></li>\n<li><strong>Application is assigned to reviewer group</strong> (see ‚ÄúReviewer Selection‚Äù)</li>\n<li><strong>Rule Violation Check</strong>: 2 reviewers, from the relevant reviewer group, review the application for rule violations.

The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating ‚Äòinterconnections‚Äô between circles promotes the idea that more information flow between teams has advantages when it comes to adapting to the changing environment. Which are increasingly recurrent.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><code>How to read this map *(and some suggestions)*:</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each circle belongs to a ‚Äòteam‚Äô of some kind (which requires having ‚Äòmeetings‚Äô or status reports every so often). <strong>Whether sharing a telegram group or a private discord channel</strong>, the suggestion is to create a ‚Äòflow of information‚Äô where at least two people from each circle participate.</li>\n<li>People who are at the intersection of two circles belong to both teams as full members (and sociocracy encourages decisions to be made by consent).</li>\n<li>The most central circles should avoid making operational decisions to be executed by other circles (<strong>but allow them to define how to operate from their autonomy</strong>), and rather focus on sharing reports and generating alignment between all parties.</li>\n<li>Just because two people are not interconnected by circles doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt have direct communication. In fact, it‚Äôs amazing that we have the ability to send DMs at the speed of light. <strong>The more information flow, the more agility.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>mini-disclosure</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In some cases I have put people at random as ‚Äòexamples‚Äô of ‚Äòlead‚Äô and ‚Äòrepresentative‚Äô for lack of more information on the matter.

Before that, <a href=\"https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-optimism-alpha\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Unipig</a> was one of the earliest proof of concepts in Ethereum application scaling.</li>\n<li>Uniswap is one of the most used applications across all Superchain L2s (<a href=\"https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>) as well as the most popular DEX on Optimism with 60%+ market share (here).</li>\n<li>In addition to the scale and positive impact of Uniswap stemming from our deployment on multiple Superchain L2s, the Uniswap Foundation (‚ÄùUF‚Äù), along with many Uniswap community members, have made additional positive contributions to the community, including:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>With the OP Grant to Uniswap early 2023, the UF alongside Uniswap community members were able to successfully deploy 3 Liquidity Mining campaigns for relatively sticky liquidity on major OP pools working with delegates from both the Optimism and Uniswap governance communities.</li>\n<li>The work done by Uniswap community members, Uniswap Labs, and Across on <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7683-cross-chain-intents-standard/19619\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ERC-7683</a> focuses on establishing standards for crosschain intent fulfillment, which greatly reduces the interop friction for any dapp users needing users to bridge assets or fill transactions across chains.</li>\n<li>The UF recently co-sponsored a proposal with Whetstone Research to introduce new fee tiers on Base in order to provide more competitive pricing to swappers (<a href=\"https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-proposal-to-active-2-3-4-bps-fee-tiers-on-base/24346\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>). If successful, the insights gathered will be informative and we may expand these fee tiers to other Superchain L2s.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Please demonstrate any non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this role:</strong></p>\n<p>Our team has helped to grow the Uniswap governance community over the past two years, building strong working relationships with a large number of delegates from a wide range of organizations, recently hosting 40 delegates at a governance-specific workshop called Govswap the day before EthCC in Brussels. Working with these members of the community, we have seen the UF‚Äôs participation as a major stakeholder in Uniswap governance proposals (delegating votes to post a proposal or posting it ourselves) drop from ~60% in 2023 to ~25% so far in 2024.  We have an acute appreciation for the human and technical intricacies of various governance processes, and will act as good stewards in this role‚Äôs ‚Äúoracle‚Äù responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, we have recently taken a more active role in developing and auditing smart contracts for use by the Uniswap ecosystem, including Uniswap v4, where a team member is a leading contributor to the <a href=\"https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/graphs/contributors\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">periphery repo</a> and is intimately involved in the audit process, and Unistaker, where we managed mechanism design, contract development, and the security audit process.</p>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your technical background, including your github handle (this will be used to calculate your github expertise score and will be added to your nomination before it goes to a vote by the Foundation):</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/narangchirag\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chirag Narang</a> was most recently VP of Product at Dapper Labs, where he was responsible for Flow‚Äôs strategic direction and execution across core protocol, smart contract language, and developer experience, managing a team of 50 Engineers and 6 PMs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/erin-koen\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Erin Koen</a> spent two years (2020-2022) as a full-stack engineer at Avantgarde Finance, working on the Enzyme asset management app and its supporting infrastructure. He subsequently helped to start Avantgarde‚Äôs asset management business, managing the development of custom smart contracts to enable jurisdictionally compliant flows of funds into onchain investment vehicles.</p>\n<p>The UF‚Äôs Github can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/uniswapfoundation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>As described <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-security-council-elections-cohort-a/8587#member-responsibilities-2\">here</a>, the primary requirements of a member of the Optimism Security Council are to be available and communicate well under pressure, thoughtfully execute protocol upgrades and other proposals approved by Optimism Governance, and the manage private keys securely.</p>\n<p>The UF is well-suited to satisfy these requirements. We regularly coordinate between members of not only the Uniswap Protocol ecosystem but also across other DeFi and chain ecosystems. We have also helped to manage the execution and implementation of technical projects including smart contract and app development, security audits, and governance votes. We maintain close working relationships with stakeholders of all stripes and pride ourselves on being thorough and responsive.</p>\n<p>Further, we have managed the creation and execution of numerous onchain votes for the Uniswap Protocol since our founding two years ago and stay informed regarding those votes in which we are not principal participants. This experience can easily translate into prompt, safe execution of Optimism Governance-approved actions.</p>\n<p>Finally, our team manages onchain accounts to administer our UNI treasury as well as a portion of our grants budget. The signers on those accounts have developed and maintained protocols for transaction hygiene as well as key management.</p>\n<p><strong>Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Security Council member:</strong></p>\n<p>Coming from the Uniswap ecosystem, we understand that security is paramount to the longterm success of protocols. Often times security only becomes a focus after a crisis, but we believe that best practices for proactive security is how we maintain operational excellence as Council members. This is manifested in Uniswap through consistent audits and reviews to help establish frameworks for best understanding risks as we did with the <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Bridge-Assessment-Report-0c8477afadce425abac9c0bd175ca382?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Crosschain Bridge Assessment report</a>.</p>\n<p>While we can do everything to protect against security risks, unfortunately we must also plan for worst case scenarios. This involves war rooming at any hour, constant and transparent communications, as well as the technical competency to participate in recovery. Although we have been fortunate as a protocol, it comes with hard work behind the scenes and working with trusted partners across the ecosystem. Our philosophy here is to maintain this level of operational and technical excellence, while continuing to uphold the highest standards of communication and integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:</strong><br>\nn/a</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in the Operating Manual:</strong> Confirmed</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand that election is subject to successful completion of a Foundation screen which</strong> <strong>may include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities.

non-Optimism experience you believe is relevant to this role:</strong><br>\nThrough my involvement in various community-based projects, I have gained extensive experience in managing shared assets, particularly in terms of security. Additionally, I contribute to Dig DAO, a community that spun off from Japan Digital Agency, and I am well-versed in governance managed by multiple members, as I have been experimenting with the implementation of onchain governance at Dig DAO.</p>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your technical background, including your github handle (this will be used to calculate your github expertise score and will be added to your nomination before it goes to a vote by the Foundation):</strong><br>\nNon-technical. But I have worked with members who are building products and tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Please elaborate on your experience with relevant member (or Lead) requirements:</strong><br>\nMy background can be divided into two main areas: supporting Japan‚Äôs crypto ecosystem and conducting research and development in the public goods space.</p>\n<p>In 2022, I contributed to the operation of an incubation program aimed at nurturing Crypto Builders in Japan. This three-month program invited various accomplished developers and founders to work towards the growth of Japan‚Äôs ecosystem. In 2023, I co-hosted DAO TOKYO, an international DAO event, bringing together DAO contributors from around the world to Tokyo, further contributing to the growth of Japan‚Äôs DAO ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Since then, and continuing to the present, I have focused on research and development in the public goods space, presenting my findings internationally at conferences such as Funding the Commons Berlin/Taipei and Ethcon Korea. Notably, the grants report I published aims to achieve more effective public goods funding and has contributed to the public goods space. This research has led to my involvement in reviewing project applications for the Polygon Community Grants Program, creating grants reports for the Grant Innovation Lab, and participating in projects with the Cartographer Syndicate aimed at promoting transparency for grantees.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I remain actively engaged in activities within Japan. I have been involved in the development of <span class=\"chcklst-box fa fa-square-o fa-fw\"></span> (Yohaku), a project aimed at addressing local issues in Japan, and in the development of a Japanese Yen-based QF platform through Dig DAO, a community that spun off from Japan Digital Agency.</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://research.fracton.ventures/projects/yohaku/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b32993f3f33eab503a3bf1464ea6ab557471f3fb.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"222223\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://research.fracton.ventures/projects/yohaku/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">research.fracton.ventures</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b1bec63247ce550b35c80c86c2c8e113621ad80e_2_690x362.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"0E0E0E\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://research.fracton.ventures/projects/yohaku/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[ ]Yohaku | Fracton Research Portal</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Fracton Ventures Research is an R&amp;D institution for a positive sum world through exploring inclusive coordination design.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://research.fracton.ventures/projects/digdao/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/2X/b/b32993f3f33eab503a3bf1464ea6ab557471f3fb.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"222223\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://research.fracton.ventures/projects/digdao/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">research.fracton.ventures</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/362;\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/optimized/2X/b/b1bec63247ce550b35c80c86c2c8e113621ad80e_2_690x362.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"0E0E0E\" width=\"690\" height=\"362\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://research.fracton.ventures/projects/digdao/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Contribution to DigDAO | Fracton Research Portal</a></h3>\n\n  <p>Fracton Ventures Research is an R&amp;D institution for a positive sum world through exploring inclusive coordination design.</p>\n\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Last month, I co-hosted and contributed as a speaker at Funding the Commons Tokyo.

Therefore, it is important to maintain proper communication among Security Council members on a regular basis, fostering relationships that enable rapid response in emergencies. Additionally, having Security Council members geographically distributed across different time zones enhances the ability to respond quickly, contributing to the maintenance of the protocol‚Äôs security.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest:</strong><br>\nNo existing conflicts of interested.</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand you may be removed from this role via the Representative Removal proposal type in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Operating Manual</a>:</strong><br>\nI verify.</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you understand that election is subject to successful completion of a Foundation screen which</strong> <strong>may include KYC/AML, sanctions screening, and a requirement to sign a standard contract:</strong> [No/Yes]<br>\nYes</p>\n<p><strong>Please verify that you are able to commit ~5 active hours / month to fulfill the Member Responsibilities.
