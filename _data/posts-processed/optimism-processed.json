It‚Äôs a very important role and we know it‚Äôs not easy. Optimism delegates are asked to continuously experiment and constantly iterate; it‚Äôs never easy to be the first to do something and delegates do it everyday.</p>\n<p>While the Collective depends on a community of high context, highly engaged delegates, we also understand the realities of part-time contribution and the demands of outside commitments. Part of designing a system <a href=\"https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/DAO-Design-Principles-1a8f325a993948e185adf2fbc553e845\">resilient to churn</a>, is having a well-defined resignation process that allows delegates to take a step back from their commitment, whether short term or long term, with as little disruption to the rest of the Collective as possible.</p>\n<p>Of course, our preference is for all contributors to remain within the Collective in one capacity or another, and delegates that need to step away temporarily are always welcome back <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":red_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":red_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12\" title=\":sparkles:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":sparkles:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<h2><a name=\"token-house-resignation-process-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#token-house-resignation-process-2\"></a>Token House Resignation Process</h2>\n<p>Delegates resigning for any period of time should communicate their resignation in a <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/delegate-updates/45\">delegate communication thread</a>. It is suggested this post include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resignation period (whether short term or long term)</li>\n<li>Reason for resignation</li>\n<li>Any plans to remain active in the Collective in a different capacity</li>\n<li>Please tag <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/lavande\">@lavande</a>, from the Optimism Foundation, and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/zcf\">@zcf</a>, from Agora, so we‚Äôre aware of your resignation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a large delegate, whose inactive voting power might block quorum, please encourage your delegators to redelegate their tokens while you‚Äôre away. You may suggest a specific delegate(s) towards which your delegators should consider redelegating.</p>\n<p>Advanced delegation allows a delegate to pass-through their delegation to another delegate and would be an ideal feature to utilize in the case of short-term absences. However, while Agora has begun rolling out advanced delegation to select delegates, this feature only works on a go-forward basis and, therefore, isn‚Äôt applicable for delegations made before the feature was enabled. Broader roll-out and retroactive applicability of advanced delegation would be subject to a one-time upgrade to the token contract, which comes with serious considerations.</p>\n<p>We recommend sharing long-term resignation plans on additional platforms such as Farcaster or in the <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#gov-general</span> or <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#delegate-discussion</span> channel in Discord to broaden the audience aware of your long-term resignation. Please also tag <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/kent\">@kent</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/zcf\">@zcf</a> and/or <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/yitong\">@yitong</a> from Agora in your resignation notice so that we may adjust your delegate profile to reflect your long-term resignation and reduce the probability you receive new delegations after you‚Äôve resigned.</p>\n<p>If you hold an elected or appointed position in the Collective, you‚Äôll need to appoint a replacement and communicate this change on the forum at least 7 days prior to this change taking effect.

These include:<br>\nHere‚Äôs a refined version of the suggested Internal Operating Procedures (IOP) changes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Streamline Intake and Preliminary Review:</strong> Consolidate intake and preliminary review into a single process to enhance efficiency and rigor. This unified process should be more stringent to pass, ensuring that only high-quality proposals proceed to the next stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shorten Review Process:</strong> Reduce the duration of the review process from 6 weeks to 3 weeks to expedite decision-making and minimize delays in applicant feedback and final selections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Perpetual Finalist Status:</strong> Grant perpetual finalist status to non-elected applicants of the final review to allow sufficient time (2 weeks) for integration of feedback and revisions, reducing the need for repetitive resubmissions and administrative overhead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mid-Week Review Assignment:</strong> Implement a mid-week deadline for initial review assignments. Applications not yet reviewed by this deadline will be open for any reviewer to pick up, ensuring a balanced workload distribution and fair compensation based on individual review contributions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mandatory Feedback Focus:</strong> Make feedback regarding mission request alignment and formal application process mandatory, emphasizing alignment with established criteria rather than the viability of the project idea itself. This ensures consistency and clarity in the review process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Buffer:</strong> Incorporate a 12 to 24-hour buffer between review steps to allow the Grants Council Lead and Operations team to perform necessary operational actions, such as second assignment, application declination, and report formulation. This buffer enhances operational efficiency and responsiveness to review outcomes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Proponent Communication:</strong> Promote improved feedback mechanisms, communication channels, and contact with proponents to foster greater transparency and collaboration throughout the grants process.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Suggested Adjustments to the Charter:</strong></p>\n<p>The suggested adjustments to the Charter aim to optimize the structure and functionality of the Grants Council. These include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Audits Subcommittee Inclusion:</strong> Introduce an audits subcommittee along with its designated reviewers to enhance oversight and accountability in the audit process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Streamline Subcommittee Structure:</strong> Remove the builders and growth subcommittees as separate entities, and maintain a unified pool of reviewers to ensure equitable distribution of workload and resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible Compensation Model:</strong> Implement a system to adjust compensation based on workload, providing opportunities for reviewers with lighter responsibilities to receive proportionate compensation during the season.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Internal Reviewer Grouping:</strong> Internally categorize reviewers based on interests, performance, and availability to facilitate efficient assignment allocation and optimize team dynamics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mission Request Authorization:</strong> Enforce the acceptance of only those mission requests authorized by the Grants Council to mitigate potential principal-agent problems and uphold governance integrity.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What improvements to the team‚Äôs mandate would you suggest for next Season?</strong></p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the next season, it is recommended to continue the team‚Äôs operations with a focus on refining processes and enhancing transparency. Additionally, the review of budget allotment mid-season for Token House voting is proposed to further align the grants process with broader governance responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Grants Council has demonstrated commendable performance and remains committed to serving the needs of the Optimism Collective. Through continuous improvement and adaptation, we strive to uphold transparency, efficiency, and accountability in our operations.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-retrospective-season-5/8126\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-retrospective-season-5/8126","pubDate":"Fri, 10 May 2024 15:42:14 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8126"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-council-retrospective-season-5/8126.rss","#text":"Grant Council - Retrospective Season 5"},"filter":false},{"title":"About the Governance  Design üìê category","dc:creator":"maxwell","category":"Governance  Design üìê","description":"<p>This category is for the Collective‚Äôs metagovernance strategy!</p>\n<p>Initiatives like the Path to Metagov, Collective Feedback Commission, and programs likes the Chain Delegation Program live here.</p>\n<p>Metagovernance is governance of the governance system, so this category pertains to the design of how the Collective governs the governance system.</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/about-the-governance-design-category/8121\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/about-the-governance-design-category/8121","pubDate":"Fri, 10 May 2024 13:13:10 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"Yes","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8121"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/about-the-governance-design-category/8121.rss","#text":"About the Governance  Design üìê category"},"filter":false},{"title":"Anticapture Commission - Retrospective Season 5","dc:creator":"ACC","category":"Council Communication Threads","description":"<p><strong>1. What is your assessment of any benchmark milestones and/or impact KPIs that were set in your Budget Proposal or Charter at the start of the Season? Have you made progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase votable supply<br>\n<strong>Assessment:</strong><br>\nThe delegation to the ACC multisig on January 17 resulted in a significant increase in the votable supply, rising from 72,639,280 to 89,035,209 OP. However, since January 17, the votable supply only increased slightly to 90,049,387 OP by May 8. While the initial increase indicates a positive impact, subsequent growth was limited, and this was not solely due to the ACC existence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Define and uphold standards for top delegates<br>\n<strong>Assessment:</strong><br>\nThe first ACC‚Äôs charter introduced responsibilities such as maintaining a percentage of approvals or providing reasons for non-approvals. However, these requirements sparked discussions among members regarding the relevance of this type of responsibilities, likely leading to changes for Season 6. ACC members, who are naturally some of the most engaged contributors in the Collective, accounted for 165 of the 269 approvals given during Cycles 16 and 19, which covered the mission requests. While these requirements are likely to change for the next season, the activity level of these top delegates will probably remain unaffected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Retention of top individual delegates as OP Chains and protocols gain voting power<br>\n<strong>Assessment:</strong><br>\nMost delegates who met the membership criteria and opted in have consistently participated in the collective throughout Season 5. However, further strategies could focus on organically increasing delegation to these high-impact individuals to ensure continued engagement. Also, a detailed analysis should be conducted when Season 6 is over.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Establish a process and bridge for communication between Token House and Citizens‚Äô House<br>\n<strong>Assessment:</strong><br>\nDuring this cycle, we didn‚Äôt need to create any reports as there were no capture attempts. Consequently, we have not had direct contact beyond the fact that some members are part of both the ACC and the Citizens‚Äô House.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Impact assessment - how well did your team‚Äôs outputs support the Intent they were authorized under?</strong><br>\nThe Commission utilized the delegation it received to vote on all protocol upgrades, except during Voting Cycle 19, when we encountered issues while experimenting with different voting methods. Additionally, the work conducted this season has been significantly influenced by Intent 4 as we strive to ensure that internal processes remain as decentralized, transparent, and accessible as possible.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this experiment has led to extremely rich discussions about Governor upgrades and the need for greater decentralization in governance. These discussions have undoubtedly had a significant impact on the Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What changes would you make to the Internal Operating Procedures (IOP‚Äôs)?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clarify the voting windows now that we have established a voting method.</li>\n<li>Improve the definition of the forms of notification for upcoming votes.</li>\n<li>Set the default call length to 30 minutes, which can be extended under certain exceptions.</li>\n<li>Create an additional position alongside the Lead to share some of the responsibilities held during Season 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Suggested adjustments to the Charter?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modify the member responsibilities to better define our role as a group that acts in response to a capture attempt.</li>\n<li>Eliminate the mid-season membership recalculation, as it was time-consuming and did not result in significant changes to the number of members. In general, we should aim for minimization and strive to simplify the Charter as much as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. What improvements to the team‚Äôs mandate would you suggest for next Season? If you don‚Äôt believe the team‚Äôs operations should continue next Season, please explain why here.</strong></p>\n<p>I recommend continuing the team‚Äôs operations into next season. Although interaction with OP chains was limited this season, it‚Äôs expected to change in Season 6. If conditions remain the same, we should reconsider the future of the ACC. However, the Commission‚Äôs relevance is likely to grow with each season, so it‚Äôs essential to maintain and adapt our efforts as needed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To close this post, I want to thank everyone who engaged with the Anticapture Commission‚Äîwhether by asking a question or joining an Office Hours.</p>\n<p>Thanks you Dane for taking the time to guide me when I felt lost.</p>\n<p>A special thanks to the Governance team from the Foundation, who provided invaluable support throughout this period.

This means voters will spend more time in their areas of expertise.</p>\n<p>This has incredible potential to increase project discovery and network effects within our community. This is why with this new version, we aim to give more community stakeholder groups the opportunity to participate in RetroPGF. We will amplify the voices of token holders, delegates, RetroPGF recipients, and badgeholders as community signaling.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"community-signaling-as-a-metric-in-retro-funding-4-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#community-signaling-as-a-metric-in-retro-funding-4-1\"></a>Community Signaling as a Metric in Retro Funding 4</h3>\n<p>Retro Funding 4 is all about Metrics and one of the challenges on a heavy metrics result is that metrics can be manipulated and reductionist. Goodhart‚Äôs Law states: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</p>\n<p>Dive deeper on this in <a href=\"https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-must-be-evolutionary/18728\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this post</a> from Owocki.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, impact is more than TVL and number of unique transactions. Not every $100 transaction has the same impact. The impact of a project facilitating remittances would be considered by most to be more valuable than a meme coin, even if the onchain data says otherwise.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"pairwise-retro-funding-4-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#pairwise-retro-funding-4-2\"></a>Pairwise <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/handshake.png?v=12\" title=\":handshake:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":handshake:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Retro Funding 4</h4>\n<p>We are eager to put qualitative data onchain and give badgeholders the option to factor in community signaling as an onchain metric for Retro Funding 4 and we have a beautiful new version of our app to do it with!</p>\n<p>With Pairwise, the community can engage, discover, review, and rank the types of projects that interest them in Retro Funding 4. We will break the applicants into several categories which will contain 15-30 projects and the community will be able to rank the projects within each category, and then rank these categories as well. In this way, each voter can analyze just a portion of the projects and we can aggregate the results into one final ranking.</p>\n<p><strong>Pairwise WIP demo</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKbKcmADoc8\">Pairwise SFX V1 Demo Video With Music</a></p>\n\n<h3><a name=\"major-v2-improvements-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#major-v2-improvements-3\"></a>Major V2 improvements:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile first</li>\n<li>Voter feedback</li>\n<li>Tinder-style filtering</li>\n<li>Sound effects &amp; background music</li>\n<li>Pseudonymous account abstraction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also the community will not allocate a number of tokens to each project, instead they only rank the projects using filtering and pairwise assessment. This greatly reduces the cognitive load of voting and gamifies the user experience.</p>\n<p>The challenges to overcome are the tight timeline and engagement. We will launch a marketing campaign to maximize participation with rewards included from our RetroPGF 3 rewards!</p>\n<p>Our proposal is to create four metrics, one for each of four stakeholder group; Badgeholders Rank, OP Hodlers Rank, Builders Rank &amp; Delegates Rank. However we also could create 1 metric and give each stakeholder group 25% of the influence of an aggregated result if adding 4 metrics to the voting UI is seen as too much.

Pairwise is as fun as voting gets and we want to spice it up rewarding stakeholders signaling their preferences to the collective. We are allocating a total of 4,000 OP from our RetroPGF 3 Rewards, with 1,000 OP designated for each stakeholder group (Badgeholders, Recipients, Delegates, and Holders). Each participant‚Äôs chance of winning increases with more categories they vote in.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"raffle-tickets-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#raffle-tickets-8\"></a>Raffle Tickets:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For every 10 points earned, participants receive one raffle ticket.</li>\n<li>More tickets mean higher chances of winning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"how-to-get-points-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-to-get-points-9\"></a>How to Get Points::</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Category Participation: Finalizing the first category gives 10 points.</li>\n<li>Weighted Bonus Points (For Delegates and Hodlers bucket):\n<ul>\n<li>Whale: +20 points per category</li>\n<li>Diamond: +15 points per category</li>\n<li>Platinum: +10 points per category</li>\n<li>Gold: +5 points per category</li>\n<li>Silver: +3 points per category</li>\n<li>Bronze: No additional points</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Max Tickets: 25% of the total number of categories.

A Holder may accumulate more points than a Badgeholder, but this will not affect the distribution among Badgeholders‚Äîit only enhances their chances within the Holder category.</em></p>\n<p>At the end of the voting period, 10 winners will be randomly selected from the raffle tickets in each group. This ensures every participant has a chance to win, with active members enjoying improved odds thanks to their contributions to the collective. If a participant is both a Badgeholder and a Delegate, 1 vote will put them in both raffles!</p>\n<h3><a name=\"anti-gaming-measures-and-transparency-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#anti-gaming-measures-and-transparency-10\"></a>Anti-Gaming Measures and Transparency</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Pairwise voting process is not like snapshot, it will be very easy to track how users use the application using traditional analytics tooling to separate authentic users from bots and people who are just clicking through to promote their own projects.</li>\n<li>If the ballot submission looks like they are only farming the reward or just voting for their own projects without putting in an authentic effort to judge other projects, we will not give rewards to that voter, but we will still count the ballot. For the first round we will count every ballot even if we believe someone is farming the system for rewards.</li>\n<li>We will maintain complete transparency in the reward calculation and distribution process.

Despite facing significant challenges, the Grants Council has demonstrated remarkable adaptability and resilience, refining our review process to accommodate a surge in applications.</p>\n<p>Compared to Season 4 (306 applications) which saw a 34% increase in applications over Season 3, Season 5 experienced an astonishing 73.2% growth. We received a total of 530 Mission Request applications, along with 23 corresponding to Audit Requests from elected Service Providers.</p>\n<p>Notably, the loss of a Builders Subcommittee Member occurred when one member had to step down to be appointed as Lead. Despite this transition, the Grants Council swiftly adapted, continuing operations with one less member in the Builders Subcommittee while redistributing responsibilities to ensure the efficiency of our review process.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, each subcommittee refined Rubrics tailored to the specific goals of each Intent, resulting in 8 Rubrics applied to 27 Mission Requests. These Rubrics were incorporated into the form templates to guide Applicants during the Submission Process, made possible by the Charmverse platform.</p>\n<p>Throughout these challenges, the Council scaled its processes effectively to meet the growing demand for Optimism Grants. Reviewers have adeptly balanced providing robust evaluations with efficiency to manage the substantial increase in workload.</p>\n<p>Now, it‚Äôs time to conclude the Grants Council review process for Season 5. Here it is the list of Finalists for Cycle 22 (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wY_7P_m0AggVaZG1L_uh6k27iFODVcvMxc052jiXXE8/edit?usp=sharing\">Detailed list</a>):</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-alternative-cl-el-client-mission-request/7363\">Alternative CL/EL Client</a></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/nethermind-cl-client-c-14325524187153982\">Nethermind CL Client -

Applicants demonstrated a strong commitment to understanding the grant process, while the Council dedicated significant efforts to ensure a high-functioning process. Throughout the entire Season 5, the Council has not found it necessary to utilize the Proposer Conduct portion of the Sub-Committee Rubrics. This reflects the belief that setting high expectations for Applications results in Applicants meeting those expectations.</p>\n<p>Cycle 22 kept the selectiveness percentage almost the same as Season 4 (~22.1%). Relative to the initial set of Applications, 24.5% became finalists.</p>\n<p>The Cycle 22 Finalists represent proposed grants of ~4.56M OP. In total, recommended grants for Season 5 amount to ~7.12M OP. While the Council proposed a higher allocation for grants through a proposal to change the use of rewards designated (but unused) for other intents, the Council expects the surplus of 1.87M OP that had been approved by the Token House to be returned to the Gov Fund.</p>\n<p>The Council has truly enjoyed working towards making Optimism the top destination for builders. We genuinely hope that our efforts will help the community achieve its goals.</p>\n<p>Finalists, stay tuned for a message from the Foundation regarding KYC details.</p>\n<p>Stay optimistic! <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12\" title=\":red_circle:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":red_circle:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>*<em>The conferral of a grant is not an explicit or implicit promotion or endorsement of the projects, their representations, or their underlying products but rather an acknowledgment that the projects‚Äô applications were deemed most suited to receive a grant given the parameters applied by the mandate of Season 5 governance.

This principle serves as a North Star, motivating the creation of a more productive and sustainable ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In previous Retro Funding rounds each Citizen conducted their own assessment of impact and decided how to calculate profit by considering the past rewards received by projects and deducting that amount from impact to arrive at a final OP allocation. In <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988/3\">Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builders</a> the Collective is <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-deliberative-processes-in-the-collective/8041\"> experimenting with using a deliberative process</a> to come to consensus on a definition of profit, which will be universally applied to the retro round. Badgeholders will no longer need to calculate profit, but instead, a collective definition will be applied and subtracted from each voter‚Äôs assessment of impact.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"how-the-definition-of-profit-will-be-applied-in-retro-funding-4-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#how-the-definition-of-profit-will-be-applied-in-retro-funding-4-1\"></a><strong>How the definition of profit will be applied in Retro Funding 4</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Collecting relevant information from projects</strong>: Within the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013\">Retro Funding application process</a>, applicants are asked to provide relevant information on rewards they have received in the past. This information includes past Optimism grants, past grants from other ecosystems, revenue generated and past VC funding. Within the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-application-review-process/8012/2\">Application review process</a>, it is verified that this information has been accurate; failing to accurately report past grants and funding will result in the removal of a project from the Retro Funding round.</li>\n<li><strong>Deliberative Process:</strong> The outcome of this deliberative process will be a definition of profit for Retro Funding 4. The profit definition will be a formula, which characterizes how the rewards a project has received in the past should be considered when rewarding its impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Citizens‚Äô House Ratification</strong>: The proposed definition of profit will then be subject to ratification by the Citizens‚Äô House. Ratification will require a quorum of 30% of eligible retro round 4 voters and 51% of votes to be in favour. Ratification will take place during Special Voting Cycle <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#23b</span> (running from June 13th - June 19th).</li>\n<li><strong>Calculating impact = profit</strong>: As an outcome of Retro Funding 4 voting, each project will be assigned impact rewards (in OP). To calculate Retro Funding rewards for each project, the ratified profit definition will be used to calculate the amount of past reward units received that are to be deducted from the impact rewards. The ratified profit formula will use inputs from project (see step 1) to define past reward units received for each project, which will be subtracted from the project‚Äôs calculated impact, resulting in a final OP allocation for each project.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"defining-profit-collectively-instead-of-individually-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#defining-profit-collectively-instead-of-individually-2\"></a><strong>Defining profit collectively instead of individually</strong></h3>\n<p>In Retro Funding 4 the calculation of profit, defined by the deliberation and ratified by the Citizens‚Äô House, will be automatically applied to the voting results. The following are motivators for defining profit as a collective rather than as individual Citizens.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Predictability for Optimism contributors</strong>: For Retro Funding to achieve its goal in <a href=\"https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/citizens-house/\">fostering the creation of public goods which drive value to the Collective</a>, it is key for contributors to have predictability about the mechanics of Retro Funding rewards. The more predictable Retro Funding becomes, the more likely it is that contributors will do work with the expectation that if their work has impact, they will earn Retro Funding rewards in the future.<br>\n<strong>Different applications of ‚Äúprofit‚Äù among badgeholders can lead to highly different voting results of Retro Funding rewards among projects</strong>, significantly diminishing predictability. By agreeing on a definition of profit, the Collective can increase the predictability of Retro Funding rewards for contributors.\n<ol>\n<li>In a survey conducted among Retro Funding 3 recipients, 44 respondents evaluated the predictability of the Retro Funding rewards, giving an average rating of 1.6 out of 5 points. Here, a score of 5 indicates high predictability, while a score of 1 indicates no predictability.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce voting complexity for badgeholders:</strong> In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders <a href=\"https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Bbu5M1mTNV2Z637QxOiF7Qt7R9hy6nxghbZiFbtZOBA\">voiced feedback</a> that voting is a complex task, which can easily become overwhelming. In Retro Funding 3, badgeholders were not only asked to evaluate the impact of projects, but also consider the past rewards received by projects, taking both into account in their assignment of Retro Funding rewards. By agreeing on a definition of profit, badgeholders can focus on evaluating the impact of projects, reducing the complexity of the task at hand.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"using-deliberative-process-for-collective-definition-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#using-deliberative-process-for-collective-definition-3\"></a>Using Deliberative Process for Collective Definition</h3>\n<p>The hypothesis for using a deliberative process to create the Collective definition of profit is that it can allow Citizens to align on a topic that would otherwise be difficult to come to consensus on. You can find out more about how deliberative processes work and their proposed benefits in the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-deliberative-processes-in-the-collective/8041\">Experimenting with Deliberative Processes in the Collective</a> post. Below are details for the Collective‚Äôs deliberative process experiment in Round 4. Participants may be provided with additional information, as needed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A subset of 50 Citizens will be randomly selected to participate in the deliberative experiment. Randomly sampling individuals to make governance decisions (also called sortition) is common practice in deliberative democracy as higher quality discussion can be had with a smaller, but still representative, sample of the population. We will also experiment with sortition in retro round 6.</li>\n<li>This subset of Citizens will deliberate on a topic of relevance to Retro Funding Round 4. The deliberation is facilitated by <a href=\"https://missionspubliques.org/?lang=en\">Missions Publiques</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rndao.io/\">RnDAO</a>, both teams specialized in designing and running deliberative processes in settings ranging from <a href=\"https://citizens.ec.europa.eu/index_en\">European Commission</a> to the <a href=\"https://forum.cosmos.network/t/discussion-onboarding-managing-offboarding-the-aez-a-set-of-draft-propositions/12054\">Cosmos</a> ecosystem. This subset of Citizens will be provided with balanced information on the topic to be debated in advance of the deliberations. Participants will work in two sessions:\n<ol>\n<li>Thursday, May 30 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern // 9:30-11:00 Pacific)</li>\n<li>Thursday, June 6 from 16:30-18:00 UTC time (12:30-14:00 Eastern // 9:30-11:00 Pacific)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Between the two sessions, the community will be able to comment on the draft output of the deliberation on the governance forum. Comments by the community will be used to inform the ongoing discussion. In addition, moments of the sessions will be opened to the full Citizens‚Äô House. This allows for the broader community to better understand and trust the decision-making process. The full Citizens‚Äô House will ratify the output of the deliberative process before Round 4 voting begins. The Foundation will prepare a definition of profit, which will be applied in case the ratification of the policy recommendation by the deliberative process fails.</li>\n<li>The ratified outcome will be incorporated directly into Retro Funding 4‚Äôs impact metric calculation to allocate resources.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This thread will be used to provide updates on the R4 deliberative process experiment as it evolves.</p>\n            <p><small>5 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-deliberative-process-on-the-definition-of-profit/8083\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-deliberative-process-on-the-definition-of-profit/8083","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 13:54:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8083"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-deliberative-process-on-the-definition-of-profit/8083.rss","#text":"Retro Funding 4: Deliberative process on the definition of profit"},"filter":false},{"title":"[Discussion] On-chain Builders Delivering Metrics Data","dc:creator":"pfedprog","category":"Retro  Funding üî¥","description":"<p>Very excited about retro pgf 4.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote quote-modified\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"7988\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n    <div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png\" class=\"avatar\">\n    <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988\">Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builders - round details</a> <a class=\"badge-category__wrapper \" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/c/retrofunding/46\"><span data-category-id=\"46\" style=\"--category-badge-color: #F1592A; --category-badge-text-color: #FFFFFF;\" data-drop-close=\"true\" class=\"badge-category \" title=\"Information and threads pertaining to RetroPGF rounds\"><span class=\"badge-category__name\">üî¥ Retro Funding</span></span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    <a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/bc41dd/original/2X/a/a81ff3fced3e2ca5ab7887792ee6b31117bce110.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nZiFNAflwB2jZYLZQAsKPzV0xQ4.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[image]</a> \nSpecial thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/revmiller\">@revmiller</a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/amy\">@amy</a>  for review and feedback on this post as part of the <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-the-collective-feedback-commission/7863\">Feedback Commission</a> \n<a name=\"overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#overview-1\"></a>Overview\nRetro Funding 4 will reward onchain builders who have deployed contracts to the Superchain and contributed to the success of Optimism.

The deliberative experiment aims to test if structured discussions can help voters reach a consensus on challenging topics and enhance satisfaction in decision-making processes. Deliberative democracy has gained traction in various settings globally, proving useful for facilitating more informed decision-making, fostering social cohesion, ensuring neutral consensus, and generating buy-in for policies. To implement this experiment, a subset of 50 Round 4 voters will engage in deliberations guided by experts, with the goal of incorporating the outcomes into the voting mechanism for Round 4. This pilot project is part of a broader move towards a more scientific and interdisciplinary approach to research and experimentation within the Collective in 2024, focusing on community empowerment and independent decision-making processes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"individual-contribution-logs-contribution-verification-reputation-building-improved-funding-decisions-ssi-adoption-and-morehttpsgovoptimismiotindividual-contribution-logs-contribution-verification-reputation-building-improved-funding-decisions-ssi-adoption-and-more8042-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#individual-contribution-logs-contribution-verification-reputation-building-improved-funding-decisions-ssi-adoption-and-morehttpsgovoptimismiotindividual-contribution-logs-contribution-verification-reputation-building-improved-funding-decisions-ssi-adoption-and-more8042-2\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/individual-contribution-logs-contribution-verification-reputation-building-improved-funding-decisions-ssi-adoption-and-more/8042\">Individual Contribution Logs - Contribution verification, reputation building, improved funding decisions, SSI adoption and more!</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-04-29<br>\n<strong>Author</strong>: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/lovegrovegeorge\">@lovegrovegeorge</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nIndividual contribution logs are records of an individual‚Äôs efforts in a Web 3 ecosystem, aiding in verifying contributions and protecting assets. They offer improved verification, decision-making, accountability, and empowerment for contributors. These logs remove intermediaries and provide flexible information use. Opportunities include open-source data, self-sovereign identity, and trust-based networks. Integrating these logs into grants processes can benefit both idea and contributor funding. Further investigation and tool development are suggested to enhance the utility and reliability of individual contribution logs, with a focus on presenting code contributions. The Web 3 Association plans to explore existing tools and create new ones to support this concept, encouraging community feedback for improvement.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"optimism-forum-weekly-recap-april-22-april-28-2024httpsgovoptimismiotoptimism-forum-weekly-recap-april-22-april-28-20248045-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#optimism-forum-weekly-recap-april-22-april-28-2024httpsgovoptimismiotoptimism-forum-weekly-recap-april-22-april-28-20248045-3\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-forum-weekly-recap-april-22-april-28-2024/8045\">Optimism Forum Weekly Recap (April 22 - April 28, 2024)</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-04-30<br>\n<strong>Author</strong>: daospace</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>\nA little daospace inception here; read about all the forum posts created on the OP Forum between April 22 - April 28, 2024.

Retrospective Season 5","dc:creator":"CoCCouncil","category":"Council Communication Threads","description":"<p><strong>Retrospective - Season 5</strong></p>\n<p>First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for allowing the members of this Council for Season 5 to be part of the Collective. We have learned a lot and worked in favor of the participants of the Collective. We have conducted this Retrospective internally and want to share some important points with all of you.</p>\n<p>Please note that in some responses, there are various conclusions. We believe that seeing the different perspectives of the members is more important than reaching a consensus when submitting a Retrospective.</p>\n<p><strong>1. What is your assessment of any benchmark milestones and/or impact KPIs that were set in your Budget Proposal or Charter at the start of the Season? Have you made progress towards, or achieved, these milestones or KPIs?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We believe we have achieved progress based on our mandate, there has been less governance overhead in the management of conflicts by the Foundation, and less voting around the Code of Conduct sanctions, contributing to these <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-councils/6888\">Goals</a>, by replacing the Foundation in the processing of reported Code of Conduct Violations and eliminating enforcement responsibilities for Token House delegates by entrusting the Code of Conduct Council to process disputes. To create accountability for the Code of Conduct Council, the Token House may veto enforcement actions at any time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Generally, the introduction of Optimistic Enforcement of actions alone has already led to fewer votes needed from the Token House on these matters, we think we were effective at these goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While the CoCC wasn‚Äôt perfect, we successfully achieved these goals by soaking up governance overhead that would have otherwise fallen on the token. Our small group size (as opposed to the large Token House) meant we could dedicate more time and attention to each case than the Token House could, which would have ideally led to more optimal outcomes for the cases. Finally, the fact the CoCC Members were drawn from rank-and-file members of the Optimism Community, increased the decentralization of Optimism Governance and minimized the need of the Foundation to remain in control.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Impact assessment - how well did your team‚Äôs outputs support the Intent they were authorized under?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>All reports were discussed, with different perspectives being given for each case from members. The biggest output I am impressed with the Council has been the communications on the thread, with many members being able to handle publicly very sensitive threads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We managed cases that were a load on the Foundation and the community, taking off weight to specific areas and taking care of the public image of the collective. Managing conflict is one of those areas whose impact is invisible, and trying to measure it is paradoxical. It‚Äôs hard to reach a consensus in dicotomic situations and there will be a certain amount of descent to decisions we make. If we want to have conflict, to prove our capacity to manage it, we are incentivizing the first unwanted premise. If there are a few conflicts, we may think the group is not needed. It‚Äôs good that the conflict management offices are prepared for any emergency, and also that there are moments without conflict that prevention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think it‚Äôs less important to discuss the team‚Äôs outputs, and more important to focus on the indirect benefit to the Optimism Collective that the CoCC provided. Our inner workings and outputs ultimately minimized governance overhead for the Token House, increased decentralization of the Collective, and led to better outcomes among disputes. Our group activities and communication across Optimism‚Äôs online platform and community events appeared to reduce the frequency of disputes, reduce incivility on the online platforms, and provide a support mechanism to community members who felt they had been wronged or generally unsafe in the community; i.e. We were always there if people needed us, and it appeared as if many in the community knew this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. What changes would you make to the Internal Operating Procedures (IOP‚Äôs)?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Incentivizing people in the community to be closer to the COCC. We should be able to know about conflicts when they are small. If we are not seen close to the community, it will be harder to access cases and we‚Äôll only perceive them when they are big.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think an important goal is to keep the IOPs simple, clear, and easy to understand and adhere to. With this as a goal, I am pleased that the CoCC did indeed dedicate significant time and energy to creating and/or refining the IOPs, while always seeking feedback from the community and the Foundation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Suggested adjustments to the Charter.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Open the forms to not only strong Code of Conduct violations but also tearings of the social fabric, allowing feedback loops and notification of issues when they are small as fast as possible. Leading to not only Yes or No decisions, but to transforming polarities into informed dialogue spaces.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A change that I‚Äôve previously discussed, is that Reports should be received, processed, and reported on with 2 consecutive Voting Cycles, and not only one (i.e. the same) Voting Cycle. I believe this change would improve decision-making by the CoCC reduce pressures on CoCC Members and minimize conflicts among CoCC Members.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Giving more space for innovation within the CoCC to innovations, for example, for this initial Season we started exploring within the Council the option to use Attestations within our decisions and roles, this was something that wasn¬¥t part of the Charter, but I believe adding within the Charter a research or investigative area that includes an open mandate to innovate as Council would be seen by the members as an open playground.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. What improvements to the team‚Äôs mandate would you suggest for next Season? If you don‚Äôt believe the team‚Äôs operations should continue next Season, please explain why here.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I feel that ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) and report voting could be parallelized. The Council‚Äôs role in voting on behalf of the Token House cannot be assumed by any other entity, however, with additional resources we could expand and potentially onboard a more comprehensive method for resolutions beyond the council members themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think we should continue next season, and be given support to pivot cases to facilitation of ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution). I think this experiment was fun and beneficial to the community and the participants of the COCC (Code of Conduct Council). In my opinion, for next season we can continue polishing and iterating based on what was built to support the community and the foundation in the better identification and processing of code of conduct violations and overall management of conflicts in the Optimism ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think there can be two parallel streams to handle Reports. While the CoCC should remain the first ‚Äòport-of-call‚Äô or ‚Äòfirst responder‚Äô for all Reports, the CoCC should have the option to off-ramp selected cases to an external ADR body or process. The external ADR provider could provide increased expertise and dedicated time and staff for the longer term (supported or created by adequate funding) that could better handle these embedded, but recoverable disputes, in comparison to the direct CoCC. Cases that are not off-ramped to ADR would remain the responsibility of the CoCC, and the CoCC could increase the specialization, efficiency, and effectiveness in investigating, processing, adjudicating, and reporting on cases that lean more to obvious abuse, infractions, or breaches, as opposed to the human, personality or political disputes that are more likely breakdowns in the social fabric of the community but can still be recovered (i.e. these cases are handled by the ADR body).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The mandate of the CoCC is of high importance to the Collective because due process is required when members of the Token House are subject to any kind of sanction, especially when this sanction involves not only deleting a post but also imposing higher sanctions such as limiting their ability to participate in the Forum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Potentially, this could be the last post from the members who are part of this initial experiment.

Justice DAO is operated for charitable purposes by sympathizers of Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Donations are processed in compliance with US laws. Donated funds are paid to the outside counsel representing Storm and Pertsev and are applied to outstanding invoices for legal fees and costs.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>B. Donations are legitimate, legal, and ethical</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>This campaign will make history and donors should decide which side they want to be on.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>A number of well-known industry participants have already decided to stand with Roman &amp; Alexey and against government overreach.</li>\n<li>This is not just about defending developers ‚Äì although that is important ‚Äì it is also about demonstrating that the crypto community is full of good people who comply with the law. It is about defeating the government‚Äôs narrative that crypto is only used by criminals and others who have wrongful motives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Donating to a defense fund is legal in the United States. So is discussing and supporting donation efforts publicly on platforms (as in the case with governance forums and voting portals, for example).</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no legal or ethical prohibition against defense funds. And in the US, donors arguably have First Amendment rights to contribute to causes like this one, free from government interference or retaliation.</li>\n<li>Both Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm are represented by reputable counsel based in the Netherlands and the state of California, respectively. There is an obvious, legitimate need for defense funding because they are in the middle of defending themselves against two different governments that have vast resources to use against them.</li>\n<li>Several advocacy groups including <a href=\"https://x.com/valkenburgh/status/1776327351657181293\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Coin Center</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1776345227717951600\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Blockchain Association</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/amandatums/status/1776293907929714757\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">DeFi Education Fund</a>, have already recognized the need here and have filed public amicus briefs in support of the defense efforts. Confidentiality issues limit how much can be said between now and then, but there is substantial and increasing community support for Mr. Storm and Mr. Pertsev, including organizations that are willing to make public statements in court in support of this cause.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The fundraising campaign is compliant with the law.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Donors have the option of contributing to the cause directly through JusticeDAO‚Äôs website <a href=\"https://wewantjusticedao.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://wewantjusticedao.org</a> or by contributing ETH via <a href=\"http://juicebox.money/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">juicebox.money</a>.</li>\n<li>All incoming donations are screened for risk indicators, including money laundering and sanctions risk.

The project focuses on creating impact in the art world, both on-chain and off-chain, through initiatives like educational workshops, artist collaborations, art residencies, equipment acquisitions, exhibitions, and community building. The user, Bulls from NewtroArts, shared their experience with RPGF3 and discussed concerns regarding the recent changes in the ‚ÄúBuilder‚Äôs round‚Äù of RPGF4. They expressed sadness that their project can no longer apply to RPGF due to the shift in focus towards Token House Missions.

Feedback from Round 3 highlighted the need for reliable data on impact and standardized metrics, stronger eligibility criteria, and shorter application windows. To enhance the process, project artifacts are now collected to inform future rounds. To streamline and enhance identity management, a new Farcaster sign-in process replaces connecting wallets, allowing for account recovery and persistent identity. Projects need to be created separately from applications, fostering persistent project identities and enabling team member changes. Additional improvements include collecting funding information, email changes, and stronger eligibility criteria. These changes are seen as foundational elements for the evolving identity layer of the system.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"retro-funding-application-review-processhttpsgovoptimismiotretro-funding-application-review-process8012-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#retro-funding-application-review-processhttpsgovoptimismiotretro-funding-application-review-process8012-4\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-application-review-process/8012\">Retro Funding: Application Review Process</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-04-24<br>\n<strong>Summary</strong><br>\nThis post outlines a framework for the application review process for future Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) rounds, specifically focusing on Retro Funding 4.

Learnings from past rounds, such as Retro Funding 3, guide the improvement efforts for Retro Funding 4. The proposed process includes automated filtering, badgeholder review, appeals, and attestation phases. Key goals include minimizing human review, reducing duplicate work, and maximizing consistency in rule enforcement. Eligibility criteria and application rules are established, and applicants go through a structured review process to ensure compliance.

To support teams in committing full-time to the Collective, they are experimenting with ‚Äúbackstop grants‚Äù as a temporary measure. These grants provide teams with a minimum value of funding over a defined timeframe and scope of work, with the expectation that the recipients will shift towards Retro Funding in the long term. The success of this program will be determined by increased team commitments and teams receiving Retro Funding equal to or exceeding their backstop grant amounts.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"grants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-rounduphttpsgovoptimismiotgrants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-roundup8030-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#grants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-rounduphttpsgovoptimismiotgrants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-roundup8030-7\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-cycle-22-preliminary-review-roundup/8030\">Grants Council - Cycle 22 Preliminary Review Roundup</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-04-26<br>\n<strong>Summary</strong><br>\nThe Cycle 22 Preliminary Review has concluded with 234 applications received in total.

Its primary objective is to process Delegate Mission Applications in accordance with established procedures, review applications periodically, publish reports on grant finalists, monitor grant recipients‚Äô progress, maintain transparency, and ease the workload on delegates. The council is structured into three Sub-Committees - Builders, Growth Experiments, and Milestones &amp; Metrics, each tasked with specific responsibilities aimed at advancing the Governance Fund charter. In Season 5, the council operates with three key roles - Communications Lead, Operations Lead, and Milestone and Metrics Lead, held by Katie Garcia, Gonna.eth, and Jun (Pgov) respectively.
