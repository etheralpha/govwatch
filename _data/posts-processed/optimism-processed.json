If successfully renewed this Season, the CoCC will become a persistent structure in the Collective, assumed to continue unless/until a Council Dissolution proposal is put forward. If this proposal is defeated again in special voting cycle 23b, no new proposals will be submitted by the same prospective lead on this subject, for season 6 of the collective.</p>\n<p>The scope of this proposal is to delegate the responsibility of the enforcement of <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728\">rules of engagement</a> and <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/guidance-on-severe-violations-of-the-rules-of-engagement/5729\">severe violations</a>, to a group of seasonally elected contributors that would assume decision-making capacities on the management of the disputes and conflicting cases that arise in the community.</p>\n<p>If this operating budget is not approved, enforcing the rules of engagement will be administered by SupportNERDs.

The needs of the council members are of high context and highly specialized skills.</li>\n<li><em>Accountability to the collective</em>: The Council works with elected members who will be held accountable for their decisions and are seasonally elected to allow open participation. Members of the Council are removable via the Representative Removal proposal type outlined in the Operating Manual.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728\"><em>It takes a community to create a culture</em>:</a> Managing conflict is not only related to big cases and situations that require the enforcement of sanctions. The approach towards detection of conflict early by opening the space for small feedback loops will support the effectiveness of the work of the council in identification and capacity to solve cases (A stitch in time saves nine)</li>\n<li><em>Governance accessibility:</em> The council provides easy-to-access spaces to deal with conflict for every collective member, respecting the organization’s autonomy and trying to be neutral in decision-making. The Council does not charge more if there are more cases, we are proposing a one-time payment at the end of the season.</li>\n<li><em>Progressive decentralization</em>: The Council plays a key role in the autonomy of the collective, transferring authority to trusted members on taking a role that cover some needs that were being <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">managed by the foundation or with voting processes</a> before season 5. This council is an iteration of several efforts to reduce governance overhead from conflicts.</li>\n<li><em>Minimizing, but planning for the future</em>: Having this Council responds to a very particular need in communities which is having an internal management layer where conflict could be held privately. Managing conflict contributes to the perceived well-being of organizations, and investing on infrastructure for emergencies shapes the organizational ability to navigate the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VUCA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">VUCA</a> context we experience in Web3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"proposal-description-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#proposal-description-3\"></a><strong>Proposal description:</strong></h2>\n<p>Proposed Council Lead: Juan Carlos Bell</p>\n<p>Proposed Council Operating Budget: 26.000 OP (+8.000 OP increase from last Season)</p>\n<p>Contact Info: (<a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/juankbell\">@juankbell</a> Op forum) - (<a href=\"https://x.com/Bellcho\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@bellcho </a>X) - juankbell (Discord) -</p>\n<p><strong>- Please link to any previous work or qualifications to be Council Lead:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://regenscore.io/share/0x7d547666209755FB833f9B37EebEa38eBF513Abb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Regenscore</a>: My on-chain interaction has been mostly in Optimism, ETH mainnet, Polygon, and Gnosis chain, contributing actively to many projects in the web3 space Since 2019.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-do-you-feel-about-a-conflict-committee/3117/14\">First forum post in OP forum</a>: My first interaction with the OP forum was precisely supporting the idea of a conflict committee, back in Oct 2022.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">RFP # 2:</a> (2023) I posted a proposal in the name of Gravity DAO, supporting the implementation of code of conduct enforcement solutions in the optimism collective, improving governance accessibility, and minimizing governance overhead from the foundation, which at that point was managing Code of conduct violations via token voting.

Here’s a detailed and technical overview of how it works and why it matters.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Reclaim Protocol?</strong></p>\n<p>Reclaim Protocol (YC W21) leverages HTTPS session keys to generate zero-knowledge proofs (zkproofs) of users’ profile information. It creates digital signatures, known as zk proofs, of users’ identity and reputation on any website. These digital signatures are computed entirely on the client side, ensuring they are private and secure. When a user shares this proof with any application, one can be certain that its authenticity and integrity haven’t been compromised.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Website</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.reclaimprotocol.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Reclaim Protocol</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How Reclaim Protocol Works</strong></p>\n<p>Reclaim Protocol operates through a sophisticated mechanism that ensures the security and privacy of HTTPS traffic. Here’s a detailed technical breakdown of the process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>User Interaction with HTTPS Proxy Server</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>When a user logs into a desired website, their HTTPS request and the corresponding response are routed through an HTTPS Proxy Server known as the <strong>Attestor</strong>. The Attestor intercepts and monitors the encrypted packets transferred between the user and the website, ensuring that no private data is exposed during this process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Key Sharing and Attestation</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>The user shares session keys that reveal non-private information of the request to the Attestor. The Attestor examines the request, which contains all data in plain text except for private information such as authentication credentials. The Attestor then generates a cryptographic signature to attest that the correct request was made, ensuring the transaction’s integrity without compromising user privacy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Circuit and Regex Matching</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>The encrypted response from the website is passed to a <strong>ZK circuit</strong>. This circuit uses a decryption key as a private input to extract a regex match on the encrypted data. The Attestor further attests that the public input to the ZK proof was indeed the encrypted data from the website, ensuring the response’s authenticity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Verification by Third-Party Applications</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>With these signatures on the request and the encrypted response, along with the ZK proof itself, any third-party application can verify the existence and authenticity of the data on the user’s profile without compromising privacy. The combination of these cryptographic proofs ensures that data integrity is maintained throughout the verification process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Security and Efficiency</strong></p>\n<p>An independent third-party research group from Purdue University has formally analyzed the security of proxy-based TLS models. The key result is that the security provided by Reclaim Protocol is equivalent to that established by much more bandwidth-intensive models such as MPC (Multiparty Computation) and garbled circuits.</p>\n<p>This research confirms that while the proxy model is generally considered insecure for TLS, it is fully secure when used in the context of HTTPS, as implemented by Reclaim Protocol. The study explores potential attacks and mitigations, many of which are already implemented in Reclaim Protocol. Therefore, when questions about the security of Reclaim Protocol arise, we can confidently reference this formal definition of security.</p>\n<p>The paper highlights that Reclaim Protocol’s approach is not only secure but also significantly more efficient than other industry approaches like Deco, TLSNotary, ZkPass, Pado, and Opacity, which rely on MPC. With this formal proof published in a respected publication, we have the external validation that solidifies our position as leaders in the industry.</p>\n<p>A bonus is that Reclaim Protocol’s whitepaper has been cited in this research paper, marking our first citation. This recognition affirms the robustness and efficiency of our protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Involved</strong></p>\n<p>We are committed to fostering an inclusive and transparent environment where all contributors have the opportunity to thrive.

It’s usage is also optional and must be activated by the chain operator after the upgrade in order to be applied.</p>\n<p>The introduction of the new L1 data fee cost function required updates to the GasPriceOracle L2 predeploy, and changes op-geth to compute the fee values. The contract extension allows developers to continue using the GasPriceOracle to compute the data fee, and affects only helper functions that are outside of consensus.  We extensively evaluated the accuracy of this new function compared to multiple variants as well as the previous one across various timeslices of OP mainnet and Base mainnet transactions (<a href=\"https://github.com/roberto-bayardo/compression-analysis\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">analysis repo</a>). The new function consistently produced significant improvements in mean-squared-error and mean-absolute-error across each, and we were unable to find any instances where the new function could wildly diverge from ground truth. (We computed ground truth by putting the transaction in a simulated batch, compressing the entire batch with Brotli-10, and returning the number of bytes occupied by the transaction in the result.) Bugs in the op-geth computation might still lead to under/over payment for L1 data fees by users. Significant underpayment could result in revenue loss for the chain operator, but the system provides parameters that can be updated quickly via the SystemConfig in order to quickly compensate for such scenarios. Overall we feel this change remains low risk.</p>\n<p>Similar to the previous upgrade, Fjord uses a special upgrade block to perform the contract deployment and activation on the L2. Bugs in this code could lead to an incomplete fork with missing contracts or contract functionality expected by the upgrade, in the worst case leading to chain halt. Since this approach to automating the upgrade has been used successfully in the past, we consider this low risk.</p>\n<p>Security considerations for the parameter changes are discussed in the upgrade specification <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/fjord/derivation.md#security-considerations\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/fjord/derivation.md#security-considerations\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. These changes are also straightforward and we consider them low risk.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"impact-summary-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#impact-summary-5\"></a><strong>Impact Summary</strong></h2>\n<p>We do not anticipate any downtime due to this upgrade.</p>\n<p>Bringing EIP-7212 to the OP stack will benefit applications such as smart wallets that want to support many common authentication methods (such as Apple’s FaceID) that would otherwise be too gas intensive.</p>\n<p>We evaluated Brotli compression compared to the previous compression algorithm (zlib) on 4 OP stack chains (OP mainnet, Base, Zora, and Mode) and found compression ratio improvements ranging from 5-15% under Brotli quality level 10. This will directly translate to a 5-15% reduction in L1 data availability costs, so we expect most chains will want to activate this feature immediately following the upgrade.</p>\n<p>The FastLZ based L1 data fee function will more accurately charge for L1 data usage on a per transaction basis. Previously, highly incompressible transactions might be undercharged for L1 data usage, and a large number of such transactions might lead to an inability to recover revenue without the chain operator having to take action by re-tuning fee parameters.  We expect this new function to far more accurately detect the (lack of) compressibility of each individual transaction and reduce the chance of revenue recovery drifting from its intended target.</p>\n<p>The main impact of the parameter changes is that chain operators will have more time to respond to L1 node outage issues before the L2 chain stalls (30 minutes instead of 10 minutes).</p>\n<h1><a name=\"action-plan-for-this-release-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#action-plan-for-this-release-6\"></a><strong>Action Plan for this release</strong></h1>\n<p>If this vote passes, the Fjord upgrade will be scheduled for execution on July 10th at 16:00:01 UTC. The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Fjord is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit <code>4a487b8920daa9dc4b496d691d5f283f9bb659b1</code> and op-geth at commit <code>3fbae78d638d1b903e702a14f98644c1103ae1b3</code>. The op-node release v1.7.6 and op-geth release v1.101315.1 contain these changes.</p>\n<p>This upgrade has already been activated on internal devnets and the Sepolia Superchain in coordination with Base and Conduit.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"fault-proofs-update-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#fault-proofs-update-7\"></a>Fault Proofs Update</h2>\n<p>This is the first protocol upgrade that will activate on mainnet following the launch of Fault Proofs, which has recently been accepted by <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-protocol-upgrade-7-fault-proofs/8161/18\">governance</a>. However, its version of the op-program and Fault Dispute Game doesn’t contain the Fjord mainnet activation yet, so we need to perform an update of the Fault Proofs L1 infrastructure before the Fjord activation on mainnet. This is the first time that we need to perform this exercise.</p>\n<p>This update requires us to create a new release of the <code>op-program</code> that contains the Fjord activation and generate the so-called <em>absolute pre-state</em> for it, which is a commitment to the program and its starting state. We then have to deploy new <code>FaultDisputeGame</code>  and  <code>PerimissionedDisputeGame</code> contracts to L1 Mainnet with the new op-program pre-state hash. These steps will be done while the review period is ongoing, so that the new contracts are deployed to L1 by the time that the voting period starts.</p>\n<p>However, deploying these contracts doesn’t update the actual Fault Proofs system yet to use them. After the veto period has ended, we will ask the Security Council to sign transactions to update the <code>DisputeGameFactory</code> to use the new <code>FaultDisputeGame</code> and  <code>PermissionedDisputeGame</code> implementations that were voted on.</p>\n<p>This transaction has to be executed <em>before</em> the actual Fjord activation to avoid a broken Fault Proofs system after the activation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"emergency-cancellation-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#emergency-cancellation-8\"></a>Emergency Cancellation</h2>\n<p>The optimistic mainnet releases will contain a Fjord activation at the above mentioned time. If there is a critical security issue found between approval and rollout, the Optimism Foundation and Security Council will work to coordinate an emergency cancellation.

OSO will now move forward with a larger set of potential trust signals such as:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimist NFT holders</li>\n<li>Sybil classifiers used by the OP data team</li>\n<li>Social graph analysis</li>\n<li>Pre-permissionless Farcaster users</li>\n<li>ENS ownership</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>OSO will be running some light scenario analysis and choose the best model(s). They will also model a variety of options and share a report on the results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Small fixes:<br>\nIn the second survey, badgeholders also made a number of straightforward suggestions for how metrics could be standardized and implemented more consistently. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limiting all relevant metrics to the 6 month Retro Funding 4 evaluation window</li>\n<li>Creating versions of some metrics on both linear and logarithmic scales</li>\n<li>Creating versions of “user growth” metrics that look at a larger set of addresses vs just the “trusted user” set</li>\n<li>Copy-editing to make descriptions clearer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Action items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OSO will proceed directly with making these changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New metrics:</p>\n<p>There were several metrics that had previously been considered and were proposed again in the feedback survey. These include looking at gas efficiency; power users; a larger set of addresses than just trusted users; and protocols that are favored by multisig users.</p>\n<p>Action items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OSO will implement these new metrics where feasible</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"next-steps-testing-metrics-out-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#next-steps-testing-metrics-out-6\"></a>Next Steps: Testing metrics out</h3>\n<p>The next step in this process will be to take the metrics set for a test drive. In the week of June 3rd, Badgeholders will have the chance to test out the metrics through an interface that simulates IRL voting. Badgeholders will also have the opportunity to submit extra feedback per metric as they test each one out.</p>\n<p>Once this final round of feedback is collected and analyzed, we will be able to come back together in a session to discuss and decide on the final set of metrics to be used in Retro Funding 4.</p>\n            <p><small>6 posts - 6 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-impact-metrics-a-collective-experiment/8226\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-impact-metrics-a-collective-experiment/8226","pubDate":"Wed, 29 May 2024 11:59:28 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8226"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-impact-metrics-a-collective-experiment/8226.rss","#text":"Retro Funding 4: Impact Metrics, a Collective Experiment"},"filter":false},{"title":"Retro Funding 4: Application Review Process","dc:creator":"system","category":"Retro  Funding 🔴","description":"<p>The Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) application review process is applied to decide which applicants are eligible to participate in retro rounds and is used to enforce application rules and eligibility criteria.

Standardizing OP tokens is seen as a strategic move that will elevate the ecosystem, enhance interoperability, and ensure universal recognition and utilization of OP across various chains.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"feedback-and-suggestionhttpsgovoptimismiotfeedback-and-suggestion8208-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io#feedback-and-suggestionhttpsgovoptimismiotfeedback-and-suggestion8208-9\"></a><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/feedback-and-suggestion/8208\">Feedback And Suggestion</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Created</strong>: 2024-05-26 03:28 AM</p>\n<p><strong>Author</strong>: <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/u/agung5611\">@Agung5611</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The user is seeking assistance with an issue regarding their account not being accepted by RetroPGF 3.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-forum-weekly-recap-may-20-2024-may-26-2024/8214\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-forum-weekly-recap-may-20-2024-may-26-2024/8214","pubDate":"Mon, 27 May 2024 19:34:32 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8214"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-forum-weekly-recap-may-20-2024-may-26-2024/8214.rss","#text":"Optimism Forum Weekly Recap (May 20, 2024 - May 26, 2024)"},"filter":false},{"title":"Feedback And Suggestion","dc:creator":"Agung5611","category":"✨ General","description":"<p>Please help me with the reference, Mr. My account was not accepted by RetroPGF3</p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/feedback-and-suggestion/8208\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/feedback-and-suggestion/8208","pubDate":"Sun, 26 May 2024 07:28:02 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8208"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/feedback-and-suggestion/8208.rss","#text":"Feedback And Suggestion"},"filter":false},{"title":"Discussion OP token on all Superchain","dc:creator":"nanobro","category":"✨ General","description":"<p>We’re growing from 0 to 13 superchains and 38 OP Stack chains, yet the OP token is only available on the OP Mainnet.</p>\n<p>The integration of OP tokens across all superchains is essential for maximizing the potential of these blockchain networks. By ensuring that OP tokens are available on every superchain, we can significantly boost overall awareness and adoption. This uniformity will create a seamless user experience.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, without the presence of OP tokens on every superchain, there’s a lost opportunity for OP, as some chain users, like Base and Mode users, may remain unaware or underutilized in relation to OP. This fragmentation can hinder the growth and effectiveness of the superchain network as a whole. By standardizing OP tokens across all chains, we ensure that every participant, regardless of the specific chain they use, has equal access to the benefits and functionalities offered by OP. This will not only drive engagement and innovation within the network but also establish OP as a central, unifying asset in the blockchain community.</p>\n<p>When more developers and users know about the OP token, they will likely adopt the Optimistic vision, OP Stack, and retroPGF.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, making OP tokens available on all superchains is a strategic move that will elevate the entire ecosystem. It will enhance interoperability, increase user engagement, and ensure that the advantages of OP are universally recognized and utilized. This approach will create a more integrated and dynamic blockchain environment, ultimately driving greater success and innovation across all superchains.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 3 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/discussion-op-token-on-all-superchain/8201\">Read full topic</a></p>","link":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/discussion-op-token-on-all-superchain/8201","pubDate":"Sat, 25 May 2024 09:51:47 +0000","discourse:topicPinned":"No","discourse:topicClosed":"No","discourse:topicArchived":"No","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","#text":"gov.optimism.io-topic-8201"},"source":{"@url":"https://gov.optimism.io/t/discussion-op-token-on-all-superchain/8201.rss","#text":"Discussion OP token on all Superchain"},"filter":false},{"title":"FAQ Retro Funding “Onchain Builders”","dc:creator":"Liliop.eth","category":"Retro  Funding 🔴","description":"<p>Continuing the discussion from <a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988\">Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builders - round details</a>:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group quote-modified\" data-username=\"system\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"7988\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/bc41dd/original/1X/391d6e71a279a9f881f75bfa7df5cdf3cf905b3f.png\" class=\"avatar\"><a href=\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-onchain-builders-round-details/7988/1\">Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builders - round details</a></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No!
